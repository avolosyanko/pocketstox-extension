      "text": "ITEM 1.  Business\n\nGeneral\n\nChubb Limited is the Swiss-incorporated holding company of the Chubb Group of Companies. Chubb Limited, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Chubb Group of Companies, Chubb, we, us, or our) are a global insurance and reinsurance organization, serving the needs of a diverse group of clients worldwide. At December 31, 2024, we had total assets of $247 billion and total Chubb shareholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling interests, of $64 billion. Chubb was incorporated in 1985 at which time it opened its first business office in Bermuda and continues to maintain operations in Bermuda. We have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and the acquisition of other companies, to become a global property and casualty (P&C) leader. We expanded our personal accident and supplemental health (A&H), and life insurance business with the acquisition of Cigna's business in several Asian markets in 2022. We further advanced our goal of greater product, customer, and geographical diversification with incremental purchases that led to a controlling majority interest in Huatai Insurance Group Co. Ltd (Huatai Group), a Chinese financial services holding company with separate P&C, life, and asset management subsidiaries (collectively, Huatai) on July 1, 2023. At December 31, 2024, our ownership interest in Huatai Group was approximately 85.5 percent. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.\n\nWith operations in 54 countries and territories, Chubb provides commercial and consumer P&C insurance, A&H, reinsurance, and life insurance to a diverse group of clients. We provide commercial insurance products and service offerings such as risk management programs, loss control, and engineering and complex claims management. We provide specialized insurance products ranging from Directors & Officers (D&O) and financial lines to various specialty-casualty and umbrella and excess casualty lines to niche areas such as aviation and energy. We also offer consumer lines insurance coverage including homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella liability, and recreational marine products. In addition, we supply A&H and life insurance to individuals in select countries.\n\nWe serve multinational corporations, mid-size and small businesses with property and casualty insurance and risk engineering services; affluent and high net worth individuals with substantial assets to protect; individuals purchasing life, personal accident, supplemental health, homeowners, automobile in certain international markets and for high net worth individuals in the U.S., and specialty personal insurance coverage; companies and affinity groups providing or offering accident and health insurance programs and life insurance to their employees or members; and insurers managing exposures with reinsurance coverage.\n\nWe make available free of charge through our website (investors.chubb.com, under Financials) our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, if any, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also available through our website (under Investor Relations / Corporate Governance) are our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct, and Charters for the Committees of the Board of Directors (the Board). Printed documents are available by contacting our Investor Relations Department (Telephone: +1 (212) 827-4445, E-mail: investorrelations@chubb.com).\n\nWe also use our website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure). Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations portion of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this report. The SEC maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file with the SEC.\n\nCustomers\n\nFor most commercial and personal lines of business we offer, insureds typically use the services of an insurance broker or agent. An insurance broker acts as an agent for the insureds, offering advice on the types and amount of insurance to purchase, and assists in the negotiation of price and terms and conditions. We obtain business from the local and major international insurance brokers and typically pay a commission to brokers for any business accepted and bound. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In our \n\nPART I \n\nopinion, no material part of our business is dependent upon a single insured or group of insureds. We do not believe that the loss of any one insured would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nCompetition\n\nCompetition in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace is substantial. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S., Bermuda, European, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and management resources than we do. In addition, capital market participants have created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. We also compete with new companies and existing companies that move into the insurance and reinsurance markets. Competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups (such as group captives and catastrophe pools), and other underwriting organizations. Competitors sell through various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing, and customer segmentation. We compete for business not only on the basis of price but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service. We also compete in China for assets under management (AUM) with investment management firms, banks, and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to those offered by Huatai's asset management companies.\n\nThe insurance industry is changing rapidly. Our ability to compete is dependent on a number of factors, particularly our ability to maintain the appropriate financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies and effectively using digital capabilities, including the growth of new digital-based distribution models, in an everchanging competitive landscape and incorporating, among other things, climate and environmental changes into our insurance processes, products, and services. Our broad market capabilities in personal, commercial, specialty, and A&H lines made available by our underwriting expertise, business infrastructure, and global presence, help define our competitive advantage. Our superior claims service is a significant asset to our business, our business partners and customers, and is unique in the industry. Our strong balance sheet is attractive to businesses, and our strong capital position and global platform affords us opportunities for growth not available to smaller, less diversified insurance companies. Refer to “Segment Information” for competitive environment by segment.\n\nTrademarks and Trade Names\n\nVarious trademarks and trade names we use protect names of certain products and services we offer and are important to the extent they provide goodwill and name recognition in the insurance industry. We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect these proprietary rights, including various trade secret and trademark laws. We intend to retain material trademark rights in perpetuity, so long as it satisfies the use and registration requirements of applicable countries. One or more of the trademarks and trade names could be material to our ability to sell our products and services. We have taken appropriate steps to protect our ownership of key names, and we believe it is unlikely that anyone would be able to prevent us from using names in places or circumstances material to our operations.\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nGlobal Workforce\n\nAt Chubb, our employees are central to our commitment to deliver excellence in all we do, to provide exceptional service for our customers and business partners, and to be there when our customers need us most.\n\nWe operate in 54 countries and territories and our global workforce of 43,000 employees is geographically dispersed with 39 percent in North America, 38 percent in Asia, 13 percent in Latin America and 10 percent in Europe, Eurasia, and Africa. The average age of our workforce is 41 years, and the average tenure is 7.4 years.\n\nOur success depends on diversity of opportunity and capability — our mix of products, our geographic reach, our presence across the world’s many cultures, and our effort and ability to attract, develop, and retain the very best talent, wherever we operate, without regard to color, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or any other personal characteristic unrelated to work responsibilities.\n\nChubb Culture\n\nOur culture supports a consistency in how we approach our business and how we work together in our company towards a common objective. We are clear about what it takes to succeed at Chubb — professionalism, skill and craftsmanship, and a commitment to execution excellence, both individually and as a team. We foster an environment where frank, yet respectful communication thrives, driven by a shared vision and pride that unites us for a greater good. We expect decisions about hiring, career opportunities, development, promotion, and compensation to be based on merit and free from bias related to individual differences.\n\nHuman Capital Management Measures\n\nWe have multiple measures of human capital management, including how well we are doing in providing opportunity for everyone to succeed:\n\n•Women lead lines of business that account for 40 percent of our global premium, lead several of our key global functions (including Enterprise Risk Management, Operations and Technology, Human Resources and Communications) and hold about a third of our executive level manager roles, as well as more than 40 percent of the next most senior manager roles.\n\n•Our business leaders reflect the ethnic diversity of our global footprint. The most senior executives who lead the company’s largest businesses and functions come from Ecuador, Argentina, Australia, the U.K., Korea, Canada, China, Chile, South Africa, and the U.S. Within the U.S., nearly 20 percent of our executive level managers are racially diverse, as well as more than 27 percent of the next most senior managers.\n\n•Investing in opportunities for personal growth and development is a key to our success. These development opportunities help our employees gain exposure and experiences that empower them to grow and contribute and enable our leaders to be intentional in maximizing the potential of each team member. In 2024, over 8,000 employees participated in facilitated learning programs, and close to 3,500 colleagues engaged in programs designed to enhance cultural awareness and inclusion.\n\n•Our Business Roundtable groups, engagement committees, and inclusion councils strive to support and drive meaningful connections and a sense of belonging across Chubb. Their commitment not only enhances our workplace culture but also drives positive business outcomes. They exemplify Chubb’s culture through their passion, spirit of generosity and dedication to something bigger than themselves.\n\n•Chubb delivers market competitive compensation and benefits to its employees utilizing benchmarking support from consultants for an external perspective and leveraging analytical tools to monitor and ensure internal pay equity. As an example, Chubb’s 2023 and 2024 U.S. pay equity analysis determined that there was no racial or gender pay gap in Chubb’s U.S. employee population for employees in similar roles.\n\nSegment Information\n\nChubb operates through six business segments: North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P&C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. In 2024, consolidated net premiums earned (NPE) was $49.8 billion. On July 1, 2023, in connection with obtaining a controlling ownership interest in Huatai Group, we discontinued equity method accounting and applied consolidation accounting to our investment. Therefore, the business activity for, and the financial position of, Huatai Group is reported at 100 percent on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of that date. The relevant amounts attributable to shareholders other than Chubb are reflected under Noncontrolling interests. Huatai Group's life insurance and asset management businesses are included in the Life Insurance segment, and Huatai Group's P&C business is included in the Overseas General Insurance segment. Results for Huatai Group's non-insurance operations, comprising real estate and holding company activity, are included in Corporate. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our segments.\n\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance (40 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview\n\nThe North America Commercial P&C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide P&C and A&H insurance and services to large, middle market, and small commercial businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment includes:\n\n•Commercial Insurance (39 percent of this segment's 2024 NPE), which includes our retail division focused on middle market customers and small businesses\n\n•Major Accounts (38 percent of this segment's 2024 NPE), our retail division focused on large institutional organizations and corporate companies\n\n•Westchester (18 percent of this segment's 2024 NPE), our wholesale and specialty division\n\n•Chubb Bermuda (5 percent of this segment’s 2024 NPE), our high excess retail division\n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nThe Commercial Insurance operations provide a broad range of P&C, financial lines, and A&H products targeted to U.S and Canadian-based middle market customers in a variety of industries, while the Small Commercial operations provide a broad range of P&C, workers' compensation, small commercial management and professional liability for small businesses based in the U.S.\n\n•Commercial Insurance products and services offered include traditional P&C lines of business, including Package, which combines property and general liability, workers' compensation, automobile, umbrella; financial lines of business, including professional liability, management liability and cyber risk coverage; and other lines including environmental, A&H, and \n\n4\n\n\ninternational coverages. Commercial Insurance distributes its insurance products through a North American network of independent retail agents and regional, multinational and digital brokers. Generally, our customers purchase insurance through a single retail agent or broker, do not employ a risk management department, and do not retain significant risk through self-insured retentions. The majority of our customers purchase a Package product or a portfolio of products, which is a collection of insurance offerings designed to cover various needs.\n\n•Small Commercial Insurance products and services offered include property and casualty lines of business, including a business owner policy which contains property and general liability; financial lines, including professional liability, management liability, and cyber risk coverage; and other lines including workers’ compensation, automobile liability, and international coverages. Products are generally offered through a North American network of independent agents and retail brokers, as well as eTraditional, which are digital platforms where we electronically quote, bind, and issue for agents and brokers. An example of this is the Chubb Marketplace.\n\nMajor Accounts provides a broad array of commercial lines of products and services, including traditional and specialty P&C, risk management, and A&H products to large U.S. and Canadian-based institutional organizations and corporate companies. Major Accounts distributes its insurance products primarily through a limited number of retail brokers. In addition to using brokers, certain products are also distributed through general agents, independent agents, managing general agents (MGA), managing general underwriters, alliances, affinity groups, and direct marketing operations. Products and services offered include property, professional liability, cyber risk, excess casualty, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, commercial marine, surety, environmental, construction, medical risk, inland marine, and A&H coverages, as well as claims and risk management products and services. \n\nThe Major Accounts operations are organized into the following distinct business units, each offering specialized products and services targeted at specific markets:\n\n•Chubb Global Casualty offers a range of customized risk management primary casualty products designed to help large insureds, including national accounts, manage risk for workers’ compensation, general liability, and automobile liability coverages. Chubb Global Casualty also provides products which insure specific global operating risks of U.S.-based multinational companies and include deductible programs, captive programs, and paid or incurred loss retrospective plans. Within Chubb Global Casualty, Chubb Alternative Risk Solutions Group underwrites contractual indemnification policies which provide prospective coverage for loss events within the insured’s policy retention levels, and underwrites assumed loss portfolio transfer (LPT) contracts in which insured loss events have occurred prior to the inception of the contract. \n\n•Property provides products and services including primary, quota share and excess all-risk insurance, risk management programs and services, commercial, inland marine, and aerospace products.\n\n•Casualty provides coverages including umbrella and excess liability, environmental risk, casualty programs for commercial construction related projects for companies and institutions, medical risk specialty liability products for the healthcare industry, and casualty insurance solutions for commercial real estate.\n\n•Surety offers a wide variety of surety products and specializes in underwriting both commercial and contract bonds and has the capacity for bond issuance on an international basis. \n\n•Accident & Health (A&H) products are targeted to large corporate and affinity groups, and include employee benefit plans, occupational accident, student accident, and worldwide travel accident and global medical programs. With respect to products that include supplemental medical and hospital indemnity coverages, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore insulated from rising healthcare costs. A&H also provides specialty consumer lines products, including credit card enhancement programs (identity theft, rental car collision damage waiver, trip travel, and purchase protection benefits). \n\n•Financial Lines provides management liability and professional liability (D&O and E&O), transactional risk, and cyber risk products to public companies as well as to private and not-for-profit organizations.\n\n•ESIS Inc. (ESIS) is an in-house third-party claims administrator that performs claims management and risk control services for domestic and international organizations as well as for the North America Commercial P&C Insurance segment. ESIS services include comprehensive medical managed care; integrated disability services; pre-loss control and risk management; health, safety, and environmental consulting; salvage and subrogation; and healthcare recovery services. The net results for ESIS are included in North America Commercial P&C Insurance’s administrative expenses.\n\nWestchester is our wholesale and specialty division that serves the market for business risks that tend to be hard to place or not easily covered by traditional policies due to unique or complex exposures. Westchester provides specialty products for property, \n\n5\n\n\ncasualty, environmental, professional liability, inland marine, product recall, small business, and pet insurance, with digital and program coverages in the U.S. Products are offered through the wholesale distribution channel. In 2024, Westchester expanded its operations through the acquisition of Healthy Paws Pet Insurance LLC, a managing general agent specializing in pet insurance, from Aon plc. Chubb has been the exclusive underwriter of Healthy Paws Pet Insurance LLC since 2013.\n\nChubb Bermuda is our high excess retail division which provides commercial insurance products on an excess basis including excess liability, D&O, professional liability, property, and political risk, the latter being written by Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd., a wholly-owned managing agent. Chubb Bermuda focuses on Fortune 1000 companies and targets risks that are generally low in frequency and high in severity. Products are offered primarily through the Bermuda offices of major, internationally recognized insurance brokers.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nThe Commercial Insurance operations compete against numerous insurance companies ranging from large national carriers to small and mid-size insurers who provide specialty coverages and standard P&C products. Recent competitive developments include the growth of new digital-based distribution models. Westchester competes against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional competitors and other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions and captive programs, and also employs digital-based distribution. Chubb Bermuda competes against international commercial carriers writing business on an excess of loss basis.\n\nMajor Accounts competes against a number of large, global carriers as well as regional competitors and other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions and captive programs. The markets in which we compete are subject to significant cycles of fluctuating capacity and wide disparities in price adequacy. We pursue a specialist strategy and focus on market opportunities where we can compete effectively based on service levels and product design, while still achieving an adequate level of profitability. We also achieve a competitive advantage through Major Accounts’ innovative product offerings and our ability to provide multiple products to a single client due to our nationwide local presence. In addition, all our domestic commercial units are able to deliver global products and coverage to customers in concert with our Overseas General Insurance segment. \n\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance (12 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview\n\nThe North America Personal P&C Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb Personal Risk Services division, which includes high-net-worth personal lines business, with operations in the U.S. and Canada. This segment provides affluent and high-net-worth individuals and families with homeowners, high value automobile and collector cars, valuable articles (including fine arts), personal and excess liability/umbrella, travel insurance, cyber, and recreational marine insurance and services. Our homeowners business, including valuable articles, represented 69 percent of North America Personal P&C Insurance’s net premiums earned in 2024.  \n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nChubb Personal Risk Services offers comprehensive personal insurance products and services to meet the evolving needs of high-net-worth families and individuals. Our seamless customer experience and superior coverage protect not only our clients’ most valuable possessions, but also their standard of living. Our target customers consist of high-net-worth consumers with insurance needs that typically extend beyond what mass market carriers can offer. These coverages are offered on both an admitted and excess and surplus lines basis through independent regional agents and brokers, as well as digital partnerships. \n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nChubb Personal Risk Services competes against insurance companies of varying sizes that sell personal lines products through various distribution channels, including retail agents as well as online distribution channels. We achieve a competitive advantage through our ability to address the specific needs of high-net-worth families and individuals, to provide superior service to our customers, and to develop and deploy digital production and processes.\n\n6\n\n\nNorth America Agricultural Insurance (5 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview\n\nThe North America Agricultural Insurance segment comprises our U.S. and Canadian based businesses that provide a variety of coverages including crop insurance, primarily Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail insurance through Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. (Rain and Hail), as well as farm and ranch and specialty P&C commercial insurance products and services through our Chubb Agribusiness unit.\n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nRain and Hail provides comprehensive MPCI and crop-hail insurance coverages. \n\n•MPCI is federally subsidized crop protection from numerous causes of loss, including drought, excessive moisture, freeze, disease and more. The MPCI program is offered in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. MPCI products include revenue protection (defined as providing both commodity price and yield coverages), yield protection, margin protection, prevented planting coverage, and replant coverage. For additional information on our MPCI program, refer to “Crop Insurance” under Item 7.\n\n•Crop-Hail coverage provides crop protection from damage caused by hail and/or fire, with options in some markets for other perils such as wind or theft. Coverage is provided on an acre-by-acre basis and is available in the U.S. and in some parts of Canada. Crop-Hail can be used in conjunction with MPCI or other comprehensive coverages to offset the deductible and provide protection up to the actual cash value of the crop.\n\nChubb Agribusiness comprises Commercial Agribusiness and Farm and Ranch Agribusiness. \n\n•Commercial Agribusiness offers specialty P&C coverages for commercial companies that manufacture, process, and distribute agricultural products. Commercial products and services include property, general liability for premises/operations and product liability, commercial automobile, workers' compensation, employment practices liability coverage, built-in coverage for premises pollution, cyber and information security, and product withdrawal.  \n\n•Farm and Ranch Agribusiness offers an extensive line of coverages for farming operations from Hobby/Gentleman farms to complex corporate farms and equine services including personal use, boarding, and training. Coverages include farm and ranch structures, automobile and other vehicle coverages, and machinery and other equipment coverages. \n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nRain and Hail primarily operates in a federally regulated program where all approved providers offer the same product forms and rates through independent and/or captive agents. We seek a competitive advantage through our ability to provide superior service to our customers, including the development of digital solutions. Chubb Agribusiness competes against both national and regional competitors offering specialty P&C insurance coverages to companies that manufacture, process, and distribute agricultural products. \n\nOverseas General Insurance (27 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview \n\nThe Overseas General Insurance segment comprises our retail division Chubb International, which includes Huatai Property & Casualty Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai P&C), our wholesale division Chubb Global Markets (CGM), and the international supplemental A&H business of Combined International Insurance, which is no longer writing new business. Chubb International comprises our international retail commercial P&C and corporate A&H traditional and specialty lines serving large corporations, middle market and small customers; consumer A&H and traditional and specialty personal lines business serving local territories outside the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada. CGM, our London-based international specialty and excess and surplus lines wholesale business, includes Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) Syndicate 2488, a wholly-owned Chubb syndicate supported by funds at Lloyd’s provided by Chubb Corporate Members. Syndicate 2488 has an underwriting capacity of £630 million for the Lloyd’s 2025 account year. The syndicate is managed by Chubb’s Lloyd’s managing agency, Chubb Underwriting Agencies Limited. At December 31, 2024, our ownership interest in Huatai P&C was approximately 85.5 percent.\n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nChubb International maintains a presence in every major insurance market in the world and is organized geographically along product lines as follows: Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia (including Huatai P&C), and Latin America. Products offered \n\n7\n\n\ninclude commercial P&C and corporate A&H lines, including specialty coverages and services, and consumer lines, including A&H and personal lines insurance products. Chubb International's P&C business is generally written, on both a direct and assumed basis, through major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Certain branded products are also offered via digital-commerce platforms, allowing agents and brokers to quote, bind, and issue policies at their convenience. Huatai P&C provides a range of commercial and personal P&C products in China, including automobile, homeowners, property, professional liability, product liability, employer liability, business interruption, marine cargo, personal accident, supplemental health, and specialty risk. These products are marketed through various distribution channels including nearly 200 licensed sales locations in 28 Chinese provinces. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage, as well as energy industry-related, marine, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. A&H and other consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, including thousands of telemarketers, and sponsor relationships. The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical coverages including accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection. We are not in the primary healthcare business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore largely insulated from the direct impact of rising healthcare costs. Chubb International specialty coverages include D&O, professional indemnity, cyber, surety, aviation, political risk, and specialty personal lines products. Chubb International personal lines operations provide a wide range of consumer lines products to meet the needs of specific target markets around the world. Products include high net worth homes, traditional homeowners, automobile, and specialty products that cover smart phones, eyeglasses, and personal cyber risk. \n\nCGM offers products through its parallel distribution network via two legal entities, Chubb European Group SE (CEG) and Chubb Underwriting Agencies Limited, managing agent of Syndicate 2488. CGM uses the Syndicate to underwrite P&C business on a global basis through Lloyd's worldwide licenses. They also use CEG to underwrite similar classes, including in the U.S. where they are eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with the Syndicate or CEG include licensing eligibilities and client/broker preference. CGM also has a presence outside London, in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America, for certain specialty lines of business (political risk and trade credit as well as aviation) which are underwritten by local Chubb entities. All business underwritten by CGM is accessed through registered brokers, except for a limited number of direct relationships, where risks are written without an intermediary. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, marine, financial lines, cyber, political risk, and credit.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nChubb International's primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. Huatai P&C's primary competitors are China-based insurers, including state-owned or government related entities. For the A&H and personal lines businesses, locally based competitors also include financial institutions and bank owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. Our international operations also have the advantage of selling products through a variety of distribution channels including partnerships with major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Additionally, as noted above, certain branded products are also offered via digital-commerce platforms. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also having a significant presence in all of the countries in which we operate, giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise and regulatory environments, understanding local markets and culture, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.\n\nCGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks it underwrites for all lines of business. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd's syndicates, other carriers operating in the London market, and other major international insurers and reinsurers. Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. CGM differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and CEG), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.\n\n8\n\n\nGlobal Reinsurance (3 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview\n\nThe Global Reinsurance segment represents Chubb's reinsurance operations comprising Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada. Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide primarily through reinsurance brokers under the Chubb Tempest Re brand name and provides a broad range of traditional and non-traditional reinsurance coverage to a diverse array of primary P&C companies.\n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nGlobal Reinsurance services clients globally through its major units. Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units' underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and clients by providing a responsive, client-focused approach to risk assessment and pricing. Global Reinsurance’s diversified portfolio is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.\n\nChubb Tempest Re Bermuda principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance to insurers of commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance protects a ceding company against an accumulation of losses covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding company's accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance treaty. Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for some select clients.\n\nChubb Tempest Re USA offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property and casualty reinsurance. Chubb Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.\n\nChubb Tempest Re International offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and non-Canadian risks, including but not limited to property, property catastrophe, casualty, and specialty. Chubb Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.\n\nChubb Tempest Re Canada offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for the Canadian market, including but not limited to property, property catastrophe, casualty, and specialty. Chubb Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nThe Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance organizations. In addition, capital markets participants have developed alternative capital sources intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. Government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can also affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of Chubb's strong capital position, analytical capabilities, experienced underwriting team and quality customer service. The key competitors in Global Reinsurance's markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of Global Reinsurance's global platform is that it can change its mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which it operates. Global Reinsurance's geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since its offices, except for Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.\n\n9\n\n\nLife Insurance (13 percent of 2024 Consolidated NPE)\n\nOverview\n\nThe Life Insurance segment comprises our international life operations (Chubb Life), which includes Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. Also included in the Life Insurance segment are Huatai’s asset management companies, principally Huatai Asset Management Co. Ltd and Huatai Baoxing Fund Management. At December 31, 2024, our direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life was 88.2 percent, Huatai Asset Management Co. Ltd. was 77.8 percent, and Huatai Baoxing Fund Management was 72.7 percent. Insurance and asset management form an integral part of our China strategy to help customers with their protection and savings needs.\n\nProducts and Distribution\n\nChubb Life provides individual life, accident and health, and group benefit insurance primarily in Asia which accounts for 95 percent of Chubb Life net written premiums and deposits. Our Asia markets comprise South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Myanmar. Outside of Asia, Chubb Life has a presence in Egypt and selectively in Latin America, with key markets being Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico through a joint distribution model with Chubb Overseas General Insurance.\n\nChubb Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, universal life, unit linked contracts, endowment plans, individual and group term life, dental, critical illness, dementia, hospital cash, personal accident, credit life and group employee benefits. The policies written by Chubb Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds upon death or insured event occurring and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living in the case of savings products. Chubb Life earns income from both insurance contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks and investment contracts not subject to insurance risks. Net investment income is a significant component of Segment income and is earned through strategic asset allocation based on asset liability matching and risk adjusted returns. \n\nFunds received from policyholders for investment contracts are not recorded as premium revenue, but rather as policyholder deposits with an offsetting policyholder account balance liability on the balance sheet. We earn income on investment contracts from both net investment spreads on policyholder account balances and fees for management and administrative services. These investment contracts are an important component of production. \n\nChubb Life operates a multichannel distribution network enabling wider consumer reach. Our controlled distribution channels are a majority of net written premiums and include tied agency and telemarketing where we focus on recruiting, training and management of quality active distributors. Our captive agency distribution and telemarketing channels sell Chubb Life products exclusively and enable us to maintain direct contact with the retail consumer, promote quality sales practices, and generate better persistency. Independent brokers complement our agency channel, reaching a wider pool of mass affluent customers, especially in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In China, Huatai Life has a network of over 300 branches across 20 provinces.\n\nChubb Life growth is focused on maximizing opportunities in Asia, where we have market leading positions in direct marketing notably in South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia. We intend to take advantage of rapid growth in our face-to-face channels through tied and independent agents and selected bancassurance partnerships. These distribution channels generate operating profits that exceed our target returns on invested capital and are sustainable due to a large in-force book. We are rapidly transforming our business digitally, leveraging our global data and artificial Intelligence assets to capitalize on digital partnership capabilities and our unique positioning as the leading composite insurer in Asia. \n\nHuatai Asset Management is licensed to manage institutional, pension, and retail mutual fund investments. Huatai asset management companies earn management and performance fees from the management of third-party assets and also earn fees related to the origination, distribution and management of private loans on behalf of highly rated domestic institutions in China.\n\nChubb Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. Chubb Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, Chubb Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term net income volatility is expected.\n\n10\n\n\nCombined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada through both worksite and direct marketing sales. In the U.S., worksite products for mid and large-market employers are distributed through Chubb Workplace Benefits and a strong broker network. Combined U.S. focuses on small to mid-market employers, Main Street brokers and individual sales. In Canada, the business goes to market as Combined Canada, focused primarily on individual sales. Combined Insurance's substantial sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nChubb Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, local insurers, joint ventures, and state-owned insurers. Chubb's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence and strong local management capabilities gives Chubb Life a strong base from which to compete and grow revenues. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.\n\nIn China, we also compete for assets under management (AUM) with investment management firms, banks, and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to those offered by Huatai Group’s asset management companies. \n\nCorporate\n\nCorporate results primarily include results of all run-off asbestos and environmental (A&E) exposures, the results of our run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, certain other run-off exposures including molestation exposures, and income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and the results of our non-insurance companies. The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims. Effective July 1, 2023, Huatai Group’s non-insurance operations results, comprising real estate and holding company activity, are included in Corporate.\n\nOur exposure to A&E, abuse or molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and The Chubb Corporation in 2016. The A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites.\n\nUnderwriting\n\nChubb is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and appropriate use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.\n\nActuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns, as well as inflationary forces, are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes. This is intended to help ensure that exposures are priced appropriately and resulting losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and Chubb as a whole. Our use of such tools and data also reflects an understanding of their inherent limitations and uncertainties. We also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks. For additional information refer to \"Risk Factors\" under Item 1A, “Reinsurance Protection”, below, “Catastrophe Management” and “Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program”, under Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\n11\n\n\nReinsurance Protection\n\nAs part of our risk management strategy, we purchase reinsurance protection to mitigate our exposure to losses, including certain catastrophes, to a level consistent with our risk appetite. Although reinsurance agreements contractually obligate our reinsurers to reimburse us for an agreed-upon portion of our gross paid losses, reinsurance does not discharge our primary liability to our insureds and, thus, we ultimately remain liable for the gross direct losses. In certain countries, reinsurer selection is limited by local laws or regulations. In most countries there is more freedom of choice, and the counterparty is selected based upon its financial strength, claims settlement record, management, line of business expertise, and its price for assuming the risk transferred. In support of this process, we maintain a Chubb authorized reinsurer list that stratifies these authorized reinsurers by classes of business and acceptable limits. This list is maintained by our Reinsurance Security Committee (RSC), a committee comprising senior management personnel and a dedicated reinsurer security team. Changes to the list are authorized by the RSC and recommended to the Chair of the Risk and Underwriting Committee. The reinsurers on the authorized list and potential new markets are regularly reviewed and the list may be modified following these reviews. In addition to the authorized list, there is a formal exception process that allows authorized reinsurance buyers to use reinsurers already on the authorized list for higher limits or different lines of business, for example, or other reinsurers not on the authorized list if their use is supported by compelling business reasons for a particular reinsurance program. \n\nA separate policy and process exists for captive reinsurance companies. Generally, these reinsurance companies are established by our clients or our clients have an interest in them. It is generally our policy to obtain collateral equal to the expected losses that may be ceded to the captive. Where appropriate, exceptions to the collateral requirement are granted but only after senior management review. Specific collateral guidelines and an exception process are in place for the North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P&C Insurance, and Overseas General Insurance segments, all of which have credit management units evaluating the captive's credit quality and that of their parent company. The credit management units, working with actuaries, determine reasonable exposure estimates (collateral calculations), ensure receipt of collateral in an acceptable form, and coordinate collateral adjustments as and when needed. Financial reviews and expected loss evaluations are performed annually for active captive accounts and as needed for run-off exposures. In addition to collateral, parental guarantees are often used to enhance the credit quality of the captive. In general, we seek to place our reinsurance with highly rated companies with which we have a strong trading relationship. For additional information refer to “Catastrophe Management” and “Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program” under Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Expenses\n\nWe establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, which are estimates of future payments on reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred. These reserves are recorded in Unpaid losses and loss expenses in the Consolidated balance sheets. The process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves for P&C claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances known at the date the loss is recognized. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed, or as laws change. Internal actuaries regularly analyze the levels of loss and loss expense reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid losses and loss expenses. These analyses could result in future changes in the estimates of loss and loss expense reserves or reinsurance recoverables and any such changes would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses represents the estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses less paid losses and loss expenses, and comprises case reserves and incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. The net undiscounted reserves related to structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims are immaterial.\n\nFor each product line, management, after consultation with internal actuaries, develops a “best estimate” of the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid losses and loss expenses that it believes provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. We evaluate our estimates of reserves quarterly in light of developing information. While we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves may be necessary in the future, we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are adequate at December 31, 2024. Future additions to reserves, if needed, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional information refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses”, under Item 7, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\n12\n\n\nFuture Policy Benefits\n\nWe establish future policy benefits reserves for long-duration contracts which generally cover accident and supplemental health (A&H), term and whole life, and annuity products. These life insurance contracts provide payments for various covered events such as death, disability, life annuity, policy surrender, and policy maturity. Future policy benefits reserves reflect the present value of expected future benefits to be paid less the present value of expected future net premiums, which is the portion of the gross premium used to fund expected future liabilities. Reserves for limited-payment contracts, under which benefits extend beyond the period of premium collection, include a deferred profit liability that represents gross premiums received in excess of expected net premiums. Deferred profit liabilities are amortized over the duration of the underlying insured liabilities. Future policy benefits reserves are recorded in Future policy benefits in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe process of establishing future policy benefits reserves can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty, requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments based on numerous factors including discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and unpaid loss adjustment expenses. These assumptions represent management's long-term best estimates. Internal actuaries review, at least annually, best estimate assumptions, which could result in changes to future policy benefits reserves or the associated reinsurance recoverables. Any changes are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. For additional information, refer to \"Critical Accounting Estimates – Future policy benefits reserves\", under Item 7, and Note 1l) and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\nPolicyholder Account Balances\n\nPolicyholder account balances represent the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges against the account balance, as applicable. These policyholder account balances also include certain unearned revenue liabilities, primarily relating to universal life and other savings products, which represent policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. For additional information, refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\nInvestments\n\nOur objective is to maximize investment income and total return while ensuring an appropriate level of liquidity, investment quality, and diversification. As such, Chubb's investment portfolio is invested primarily in investment-grade fixed-income securities as measured by the major rating agencies. We also invest in limited partnerships and investment funds. We do not allow leverage in our investment portfolio. The critical aspects of the investment process are controlled by Chubb Asset Management, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb. These aspects include asset allocation, portfolio and guideline design, risk management, and oversight of external asset managers. In this regard, Chubb Asset Management:\n\n•conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the Chubb subsidiaries, providing formal recommendations for the portfolio's structure;\n\n•establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets;\n\n•provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment advisors;\n\n•establishes and develops investment-related analytics to enhance portfolio engineering and risk control;\n\n•monitors and aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and\n\n•provides governance over the investment process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines.\n\nUnder our guidance and direction, external asset managers conduct security and sector selection and transaction execution. Use of multiple managers benefits Chubb in several ways – it provides us with operational and cost efficiencies, diversity of styles and approaches, innovations in investment research and credit and risk management, all of which enhance the risk-adjusted returns of our portfolios. \n\nChubb Asset Management determines the investment portfolio's allowable, targeted asset allocation and ranges for each of the segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns. Allowable investment classes are further refined through analysis of our operating environment including expected volatility of cash flows, potential impact on our capital position, and regulatory and rating agency considerations.\n\n13\n\n\nHuatai Asset Management has over $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) in China, and is licensed to manage institutional, pension, and retail mutual fund investments. Huatai’s asset management companies manage Huatai's investments internally. In addition, over 90 percent of total AUM are managed on behalf of third-party clients. Huatai asset management companies earn management and performance fees from the management of third-party assets and also earn fees related to the origination, distribution and management of private loans on behalf of highly rated domestic institutions in China.\n\nThe Board has established a Risk & Finance Committee which helps execute the Board's supervisory responsibilities pertaining to enterprise risk management including investment risk. Under the overall supervision of the Risk & Finance Committee, Chubb's governance over investment management is rigorous and ongoing. Among its responsibilities, the Risk & Finance Committee of the Board: \n\n•reviews and approves asset allocation targets and investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies, and objectives;\n\n•reviews and approves investment guidelines to ensure that appropriate levels of portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification, and volatility are maintained; and\n\n•systematically reviews the portfolio's exposures including any potential violations of investment guidelines. \n\nWe have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization and for individual obligors. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprising senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer.    \n\nWithin the guidelines and asset allocation parameters established by the Risk & Finance Committee, individual investment committees of the segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment-related activity that affects their operating company, including the selection of outside investment advisors, proposed asset allocation changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines.\n\nFor additional information regarding the investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\n\nRegulation\n\nOur insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally, including in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. Territories. Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in each of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled and on a group basis. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require among other things that these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus, and liquidity, meet solvency standards, and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition. The complex regulatory environments in which Chubb operates are subject to change and are regularly monitored.\n\nGroup Supervision\n\nThe Pennsylvania Insurance Department (Department) is the group-wide supervisor for the Chubb Group of Companies. In consultation with other insurance regulatory bodies that oversee Chubb's insurance activities, the Department has convened the Chubb Supervisory College (College) bi-annually since 2012, with regulator-only interim Colleges held in intervening years since 2017. The most recent College was held in October 2024. During these meetings, the College reviewed extensive information about Chubb, without material adverse comment.\n\nThe following is an overview of regulations for our operations in Switzerland, the U.S., Bermuda, and other international locations.  \n\nSwiss Operations\n\nThe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has the discretion to supervise Chubb on a group-wide basis. However, FINMA acknowledges the Department's assumption of group supervision over us.\n\nChubb Insurance (Switzerland) Limited offers property and casualty insurance to Swiss companies, A&H, and personal lines insurance for individuals of Swiss companies. We also operate a reinsurance subsidiary named Chubb Reinsurance (Switzerland) Limited, which is primarily a provider of reinsurance to Chubb entities. Both companies are licensed and governed by FINMA.\n\n14\n\n\nU.S. Operations\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish departments of insurance with broad authority to regulate, among other things: the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their producers, approval of policy forms and rates, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of the risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for the acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and the adequacy of reserves for unearned premiums, losses, and other exposures.\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and quarterly statutory financial statements with state insurance regulators. In addition, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries' operational and financial records are subject to examination at regular intervals by state regulators.\n\nAll states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies. This legislation provides that each U.S. insurance company in the insurance holding company system (system) is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of our U.S. insurers. All transactions within a system must be fair and equitable. Notice to the appropriate insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and an entity in its system. In addition, certain transactions may not be consummated without the prior approval of one or more such insurance departments.\n\nWe are also required to file annually with our domiciliary state insurance regulators an enterprise risk report that identifies material risks within our system that could pose enterprise risk to our U.S. insurers, a disclosure report that identifies our corporate governance practices, a report reflecting our internal assessment of material risks associated with our current business plan and the sufficiency of our capital resources to support those risks, and a group capital calculation report that provides a baseline quantitative measure for group risks.\n\nStatutory surplus is an important measure used by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our U.S. insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay claims, support business operations, and provide dividend capacity. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory net income, and/or investment income.\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has promulgated a recommended risk-based capital requirement for P&C insurance companies. This risk-based capital formula is used by many state regulatory authorities to identify insurance companies that may be undercapitalized and which merit further regulatory attention. These requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy using a formula that prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company's adjusted policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirement will determine whether state regulatory action is required. There are progressive risk-based capital failure levels that trigger more stringent and intrusive regulatory action. If an insurer's policyholders' surplus falls below the Mandatory Control Level (70 percent of the Authorized Control Level, as defined by the NAIC), the relevant insurance commissioner is required to place the insurer under regulatory control. \n\nHowever, an insurance regulator may allow a P&C company operating below the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business to continue its run-off. Brandywine is running off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Department.\n\nGovernment intervention continues in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage in the U.S. (and through industry initiatives in other countries). The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., has been extended under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA) through December 31, 2027, and applies to certain of our operations. \n\nFrom time to time, Chubb and its subsidiaries and affiliates receive inquiries from state agencies and attorneys general, with which we generally comply, seeking information concerning business practices, such as underwriting, claims handling, loss \n\n15\n\n\nexperience, and insurance availability. Moreover, many recent factors, such as consequences of and reactions to industry and economic conditions and focus on domestic issues, have contributed to the potential for change in the legal and regulatory framework applicable to Chubb's U.S. operations and businesses. We cannot assure that changes in laws, regulations, or investigative or enforcement activities in the various states in the U.S. will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or business practices.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity, and the requirements are extensive and detailed. Numerous states require us to certify our compliance with their data protection laws.\n\nWe are subject to the New York Department of Financial Services’ (NYDFS) Cybersecurity Regulation which mandates detailed cybersecurity standards and other obligations for all institutions, including insurance entities, authorized by the NYDFS to operate in New York. Among the requirements are the maintenance of a cybersecurity program with governance controls, risk-based minimum data security standards for technology systems, cyber breach preparedness and response requirements, including reporting obligations, vendor oversight, training, program record keeping, audit and risk assessment requirements, and certification obligations. Because our North America systems are integrated, our companies domiciled in other states may also be impacted by this regulation.\n\nAdditionally, the NAIC adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which requires licensed insurance entities to comply with detailed information security requirements. The NAIC model law is similar in many respects to the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nThe NAIC has also adopted a Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers. This is intended to be a template for state regulators to use when issuing guidance about AI governance, risk management controls, internal audit functions, and third-party systems. The Model Bulletin also advises insurers of the information and documentation that insurance regulators may request during exams and investigation of insurers' AI systems, including third-party AI systems. This bulletin has been adopted by nineteen (19) state insurance departments, with four additional state insurance departments having announced a draft version of the bulletin or their intention to adopt the bulletin, and this in turn will impact our use of artificial intelligence tools in our business operations. \n\nBermuda Operations\n\nThe Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the Insurance Act), regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda domiciled (re)insurance subsidiaries (Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries) and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. \n\nBermuda domiciled subsidiaries must prepare and file with the BMA, audited annual statutory financial statements and audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or any such other generally accepted accounting principles as the BMA may recognize. The U.S. GAAP audited financial statements are made public by the BMA. The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and content of the statutory financial statements that require Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance, and investments. In addition, each year, the Bermuda domiciled insurers are required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with an annual statutory financial return. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises the BMA’s risk-based capital model, termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof; a statutory economic balance sheet; the approved actuary’s opinion; and several prescribed schedules. The BSCR is a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to their capital. The BSCR framework applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer's assets, liabilities, and premiums, including a formula to take into account catastrophe risk exposure.\n\nThe BMA established risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements for Bermuda insurers that mandate that a Bermuda domiciled subsidiary’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) be calculated by either (a) BSCR, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. The Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries use the BSCR in calculating their solvency requirements. Bermuda statutory reporting rules include an Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) framework. The EBS framework is embedded as part of the BSCR and forms the basis of our ECR.\n\n16\n\n\nIn order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation the BMA has established a threshold capital level, (termed the Target Capital Level (TCL)), set at 120 percent of ECR, that serves as an early warning tool for the BMA. Failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL would likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight.\n\nUnder the BMA’s powers to set standards on public disclosure under the Insurance Act, the Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries are required to prepare and publish a Financial Condition Report (FCR). The FCR provides details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency and financial performance. The FCR must be filed with the BMA and requires Bermuda insurance companies to make the FCR publicly available.\n\nUnder the Insurance Act, Chubb's Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25 percent of total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends, it files with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors of the relevant Bermuda domiciled subsidiary (one of whom must be a director resident in Bermuda) and by the relevant Bermuda domiciled subsidiary’s principal representative, that it will continue to meet its required solvency margins. Furthermore, Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries may only declare and pay a dividend from retained earnings and a dividend or distribution from contributed surplus if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities.\n\nIn addition, Chubb's Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries must obtain the BMA's prior approval before reducing total statutory capital, as shown in its previous financial year's financial statements, by 15 percent or more. \n\nOther International Operations\n\nThe extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which non-U.S. Chubb operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, such as the International Accounting Standard Board’s accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 17), the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:\n\n•in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;\n\n•some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;\n\n•the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;\n\n•policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;\n\n•the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differs by country; and\n\n•regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.\n\nSignificant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.\n\nChubb operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain Chubb companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, data privacy and protection program requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and foreign exchange controls. Chubb's international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.\n\nThere are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Chubb in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on Chubb could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. \n\nEnterprise Risk Management\n\nAs an insurer, Chubb is in the business of profitably managing risk for its customers. Since risk management must permeate an organization conducting a global insurance business, we have an established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, \n\n17\n\n\nwhich encompasses climate risk, that is integrated into management of our businesses and is led by Chubb's senior management. As a result, ERM is a part of the day-to-day management of Chubb and its operations.\n\nOur global ERM framework is broadly multi-disciplinary and its strategic objectives include:\n\n•External Risks: identify, analyze, quantify, and where possible, mitigate significant external risks that could materially hamper the financial condition of Chubb and/or the achievement of corporate business objectives over the next 36 months;\n\n•Exposure Accumulations: identify and quantify the accumulation of exposure to individual counterparties, products or industry sectors, particularly those that materially extend across or correlate between business units or divisions and/or the balance sheet;\n\n•Risk Modeling: develop and use various data-sets, advanced analytics, metrics and processes (such as probabilistic exposure and economic capital models to assess aggregation risk from natural and other catastrophes) that help business and corporate leaders make informed underwriting, portfolio management, and risk management decisions within a consistent risk/reward framework;\n\n•Governance:\n\n•establish and coordinate risk guidelines that reflect the corporate appetite for risk;\n\n•monitor exposure accumulations relative to established guidelines; and\n\n•ensure effective internal risk management communication up to management and the Board (including our Risk & Finance Committee), down to the various business units and legal entities, and across the firm; and\n\n•Disclosure: develop protocols and processes for risk-related disclosure internally as well as externally to rating agencies, regulators, shareholders and analysts.\n\nChubb Group's Risk and Underwriting Committee (RUC) reports to and assists the Chief Executive Officer in the oversight and review of the ERM framework which covers the processes and guidelines used to manage the entire landscape of insurance, financial, strategic, and operational risks. The RUC is chaired by Chubb Group’s Chief Risk Officer (Chair). The RUC meets at least twice a quarter, and comprises Chubb Group's most senior executives which, in addition to the Chair, includes the Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Actuary, Chief Claims Officer, Chief Digital Business Officer, General Counsel, Executive Chairman – North America Insurance, President – North America Insurance, President – Overseas General Insurance, and Chief Underwriting Officer.\n\nThe RUC is assisted in its activities by Chubb's Enterprise Risk Unit (ERU) and Product Boards. The ERU is responsible for the collation and analysis of risk insight in two key areas. The first relates to external information that provides insight to the RUC on existing or emerging risks that might significantly impact Chubb's key objectives while the second involves internal risk aggregations arising from Chubb's business writings and other activities such as investments and operations. The ERU is independent of the operating units and reports to our Chief Risk Officer. The Product Boards exist to provide oversight for products that we offer globally. A Product Board currently exists for each of Chubb's major product areas. Each Product Board is responsible for ensuring consistency in underwriting and pricing standards, identification of emerging issues, and guidelines for relevant accumulations.\n\nChubb's Chief Risk Officer also reports to the Board's Risk & Finance Committee, which helps execute the Board's supervisory responsibilities pertaining to ERM. The role of the Risk & Finance Committee includes evaluation of the integrity and effectiveness of our ERM procedures, systems, and information; governance on major policy decisions pertaining to risk aggregation and minimization; and assessment of our major decisions and preparedness levels pertaining to perceived material risks. The Audit Committee meets with the Risk & Finance Committee at least annually in order to exercise its duties under New York Stock Exchange Rules.\n\nOthers within the overall ERM structure contribute toward accomplishing Chubb's ERM objectives, including regional management, Corporate Underwriting, Internal Audit, Compliance, external consultants, and managers of our internal control processes and procedures.\n\nChubb has a comprehensive, coordinated global sustainability program that is embedded in all areas of the organization, and its activities and performance are reported to the executive team. The senior executive responsible for overseeing the global sustainability program is the Global Climate Officer (GCO). The GCO reports to both the CEO, who approves the goals and objectives of the sustainability program, and Chubb's General Counsel. The GCO has executive management responsibility for Chubb's climate-related strategies, including business and policy initiatives and coordination with the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer regarding the execution of related underwriting and portfolio management processes.\n\n18\n\n\nThe potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry, including Chubb, are complex, myriad and will develop over a multi-year time horizon. These risks primarily include physical risks, transition risks and liability risks. Physical risks arise from direct weather–related events, such as floods, storms and wildfire and these risks may increase insurance claims.\n\nOur insurance contracts are typically renewable annually. Consequently, we can respond to changes as needed by adjusting our pricing or by restricting our exposure.\n\nAs described in \"Catastrophe Management\" under Item 7, Chubb uses catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing and portfolio management purposes. Based on science and our own experience to date, we have conducted extensive work to understand the potential impact of climate change on our risk profile. These findings actively inform our underwriting risk appetite for property-related exposures for wild-fire, where we have significantly reduced our business in certain western states, and other perils such as flood and hurricane.\n\nChubb regularly applies exclusions as part of its underwriting process, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated. Those exclusions may reflect risk-based environmental and climate-related considerations, such as restricted participation in certain industries, including mining and reclamation operations, oil refining, pipeline and related distribution operations, and chemical manufacturing and distribution. Chubb adopted a policy limiting underwriting in companies involved in thermal coal and projects involving direct mining or in-situ extraction and processing of bitumen from oil sands. Chubb also introduced underwriting criteria for oil and gas extraction and midstream projects which require reduction of methane emissions and is supporting clients with Chubb’s Methane Resource Hub which offers clients information and insights for measuring and mitigating methane emissions. We also introduced underwriting criteria for cement manufacturing, with the expectation that insureds source at least 30 percent of their kiln heat capacity from fuel sources that are not coal or petcoke. Additionally, we continue to assess our investment in carbon–intensive industries and plans for transitioning to a lower–carbon economy. As part of this assessment, Chubb has pledged to not make new debt or equity investments in companies that generate more than 30 percent of revenues from thermal coal mining or energy production from coal. Chubb closely follows emerging trends in climate litigation to assess potential risks to additional insurance products.\n\nChubb mitigates exposure to climate change risk by ceding catastrophe risk in our insurance portfolio through both reinsurance and capital markets, and our investment portfolio through the diversification of risk, industry, location, type, and duration of security. Asset concentrations are actively managed in hurricane-and flood-exposed areas, and our investment portfolio is relatively short in duration.\n\nChubb supports industries involved in mitigating climate risk through our global climate business unit, Chubb Climate+, which offers solutions to Clean Tech companies and the renewable energy sector.\n\nTax Matters\n\nRefer to “Risk Factors”, under Item 1A and Note 1 t) and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\n\n19\n\n\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n\nThe following sets forth information regarding our executive officers as of February 27, 2025:\n\nNameAgePosition\n\nEvan G.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nITEM 1A.  Risk Factors\n\nFactors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition are outlined below. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant may also impair our business or results of operations as they become known or as facts and circumstances change. Any of the risks described below could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nInsurance\n\nOur results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters. \n\nWe have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism or cyber-attack, and other catastrophic events. This could impact a variety of our businesses, including our commercial and personal lines, and life and accident and health (A&H) products. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, hailstorms, droughts, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, war, acts of terrorism, nuclear accidents, political instability, and other natural or man-made disasters, including a global or other wide-impact pandemic or a significant cyber-attack. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial. In addition, climate change and resulting changes in global temperatures, weather patterns, and sea levels may both increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future and impact our risk modeling assumptions. We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition. We cannot predict how legal, regulatory or social responses to concerns around global climate change and the resulting impact on various sectors of the economy may impact our business. In addition, exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence, which may increase possible losses due to a catastrophic cyber event. Cyber catastrophic scenarios are not bound by time or geographic limitations and cyber catastrophic perils do not have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties. Rather, cyber risks are engineered by human actors and thus are continuously evolving, often in ways that are engineered specifically to evade established loss mitigation controls. The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events, when they occur, could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf actual claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred at or prior to the balance sheet date. The process of establishing reserves can be highly complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments.\n\nActuarial staff in each of our segments regularly evaluates the levels of loss reserves. Such evaluations could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables and would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. During the loss settlement period, which can be many years in duration for some of our lines of business, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known, which may result in a change in overall reserves. In addition, application of statistical and actuarial methods may require the adjustment of overall reserves upward or downward from time to time.\n\nWe include in our loss reserves liabilities for latent claims, such as asbestos and environmental (A&E), which are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. At December 31, 2024, gross A&E liabilities represented approximately 1.6 percent of our gross loss reserves. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to many complex variables including: the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which it has no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non-products coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses, arising from either latent or non-latent causes, may be significantly greater or less than the loss and loss \n\nexpense reserves held at the balance sheet date. In addition, the amount and timing of the settlement of our P&C liabilities are uncertain and our actual payments could be higher than contemplated in our loss reserves owing to the impacts of insurance, judicial decisions, and social inflation. If our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate, we may be required to increase loss reserves at the time of the determination and our net income and capital may be reduced.\n\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\n\nAs industry practices and legislative, regulatory, judicial, social, financial, technological and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency and severity of claims. For example, \"reviver\" legislation in certain states allows civil claims relating to molestation to be asserted against policyholders that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after issuance.\n\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we use could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe seek to manage our loss exposure by maintaining a disciplined underwriting process throughout our insurance operations. We also look to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis. Excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount. In addition, we limit program size for each client and purchase third-party reinsurance for our own account. We also look to limit our loss by using assumed proportional reinsurance treaties, in which we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses ceded by the client. In proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured. We further seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. Geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone's limits.\n\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics, and no assurance can be given against the possibility of an event or series of events that result in loss levels that have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risks, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage and choice of forum may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. As a result, one or more natural or man-made catastrophes, terrorism, or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may be unable to purchase reinsurance, or if we successfully purchase reinsurance, we are subject to the possibility of non-payment.\n\nWe purchase protection from third parties, including reinsurance, to protect against catastrophes and other sources of volatility, to increase the amount of protection we can provide our clients, and as part of our overall risk management strategy. Our reinsurance business also purchases retrocessional protection which allows a reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance originally assumed by the reinsurer. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs.\n\nThere is no guarantee our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future. In addition to capacity risk, the remaining capacity may not be on terms we deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do business. Finally, we face some degree of counterparty risk whenever we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance. Consequently, the insolvency of these counterparties, or the inability, or unwillingness of any of our present or future reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance or retrocessional agreements could have an adverse effect on us. At December 31, 2024, we had $20.1 billion of reinsurance recoverables, net of reserves for uncollectible recoverables. A reinsurer's or retrocessionaire's insolvency or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we remain liable to the insured.\n\nCertain active Chubb companies are primarily liable for A&E and other exposures they have reinsured to our inactive run-off company Century Indemnity Company (Century). At December 31, 2024, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by our active subsidiaries to Century were approximately $1.9 billion. Should Century's loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due from Century to its affiliates could be payable only after the payment in full of third-party expenses and liabilities, including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables could be at risk to the extent of the shortage of \n\n23\n\n\nassets remaining to pay these recoverables. While we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables from Century are not impaired at this time, we cannot provide assurance that adverse development with respect to Century's loss reserves, if manifested, will not result in Century's rehabilitation or insolvency, which could result in our recognizing a loss. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur net income and shareholders' equity may be volatile because certain products sold by our life insurance businesses expose us to future policy benefit (FPB) reserve and market risk benefits changes that are directly affected by market and other factors and assumptions. \n\nOur pricing, establishment of liabilities for life insurance and annuity products, including reinsurance programs, are based upon various assumptions, including equity market changes, interest rates, mortality rates, morbidity rates, and policyholder behavior. Under long-duration targeted improvements (LDTI), the accounting for our FPB reserves is also sensitive to changing interest rate conditions. We are required to update for changes in discount rates quarterly and review assumptions at least annually, which could cause volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity.\n\nGuaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed living benefits (GLB), principally guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), associated with variable annuity contracts, are collectively referred to as market risk benefits (MRB). The process of establishing MRB liabilities relies on our ability to accurately estimate insured events that have not yet occurred but that are expected to occur in future periods. Significant deviations in actual experience from assumptions used for pricing and for MRB liabilities could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products and our business.\n\nUnder reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, we assumed the risk of GMDB and GMIB associated with variable annuity contracts. We ceased writing this business in 2007. Our net income is directly impacted by the changes in the MRB liability reflecting market conditions, policyholder behavior, and other changes in assumptions. We view our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance, with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing. Adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on consolidated net income.\n\nPayment of obligations under surety bonds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nThe surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses. The majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance-based guarantees. When losses occur, they may be mitigated, at times, by recovery rights to the customer’s assets, contract payments, and collateral and bankruptcy recoveries. We have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers. In that regard, we have exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced or may experience deterioration in creditworthiness. If the financial condition of these companies were adversely affected by the economy or otherwise, we may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nOur exposure to various commercial and contractual counterparties, our reliance on brokers, and certain of our policies may subject us to credit risk. \n\nWe have exposure to counterparties through a variety of commercial transactions and arrangements, including reinsurance transactions, agreements with banks, hedge funds and other investment vehicles, and derivative transactions, that expose us to credit risk in the event our counterparty fails to perform its obligations. This includes exposure to financial institutions in the form of secured and unsecured debt instruments and equity securities. \n\nIn accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims to brokers who, in turn, remit these amounts to the insured or ceding insurer. Although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, if a broker does not remit premiums paid for these policies over to us, these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with a broker with whom we transact business. However, due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk.\n\nUnder the terms of certain high-deductible policies that we offer, such as workers’ compensation and general liability, our customers are responsible for reimbursing us for an agreed-upon dollar amount per claim. In nearly all cases, we are required under such policies to pay covered claims first and then seek reimbursement for amounts within the applicable deductible from our customers. This obligation subjects us to credit risk from these customers. While we generally seek to mitigate this risk through collateral agreements and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts associated with this credit exposure, an \n\n24\n\n\nincreased inability of customers to reimburse us in this context could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a lack of credit available to our customers could impact our ability to collateralize this risk to our satisfaction, which in turn, could reduce the amount of high-deductible policies we could offer.\n\nSince we depend on a few brokers and agents for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.\n\nWe market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide, primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance and reinsurance brokers, and bancassurance relationships. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the willingness of these agents and brokers to recommend our products to their customers, and our agents and brokers may also promote and distribute the products of our competitors. Deterioration in relationships with our agent and broker distribution network or their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these agents and brokers could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nFinancial\n\nOur investment performance may affect our financial results and our ability to conduct business.\n\nOur investment assets are invested by professional investment management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with investment guidelines approved by the Risk & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Although our investment guidelines stress diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market risks and risks inherent in individual securities. Our investment performance is highly sensitive to many factors, including interest rates, inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and domestic and international political conditions. The volatility of our losses may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. Realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio would reduce our book value, and if material, can affect our ability to conduct business.\n\nVolatility in interest rates could impact the performance of our investment portfolio which could have an adverse effect on our investment income and operating results. Although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate interest rate sensitivity. Our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high-quality portfolio of primarily fixed income investments with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value. A significant increase in interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on our book value. Our life insurance investments typically focus on longer duration bonds to better match the obligations of this business. For the life insurance business, policyholder behavior may be influenced by changing interest rate conditions and require a re-balancing of duration to effectively manage our asset/liability position.\n\nAs stated, our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, investment-grade securities. However, a smaller portion of the portfolio, approximately 17 percent at December 31, 2024, is invested in below investment-grade securities. These securities, which pay a higher rate of interest, also have a higher degree of credit or default risk and may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. While we have put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets, it is possible that, in periods of economic weakness (such as recession), we may experience credit or default losses in our portfolio, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs a part of our ongoing analysis of our investment portfolio, we are required to assess current expected credit losses for our private debt held-for-investment and evaluate expected credit losses for available-for-sale securities when fair value is below amortized cost, which considers reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. This analysis requires a high degree of judgment. Financial assets with similar risk characteristics and relevant historical loss information are included in the development of an estimate of expected lifetime losses. Declines in relevant stock and other financial markets and other factors impacting the value of our investments could result in an adverse effect on our net income and other financial results.\n\nWe may require additional capital or financing sources in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.\n\nOur future capital and financing requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses, as well as our investment performance and capital expenditure obligations, including with respect to acquisitions. We may need to raise additional funds through financings or access funds through existing or new credit facilities or through short-term repurchase or borrowing arrangements. We also from time to time seek to refinance debt or credit as amounts become due or commitments expire. Any equity or debt financing or refinancing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those \n\n25\n\n\nof our Common Shares. Our access to funds under existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to use assets otherwise available for our business operations, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe may be required to post additional collateral because of changes in our reinsurance liabilities to regulated insurance companies, or because of regulatory changes that affect our companies.\n\nIf our reinsurance liabilities increase, including in our property & casualty and variable annuity reinsurance businesses, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients. In addition, regulatory changes sometimes affect our obligations to post collateral. The need to post this additional collateral, if significant enough, may require us to sell investments at a loss in order to provide securities of suitable credit quality or otherwise secure adequate capital at an unattractive cost. This could adversely impact our net income and liquidity and capital resources.\n\nU.S. and global economic and financial industry events and their consequences could harm our business, our liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price.\n\nThe consequences of adverse global or regional market and economic conditions may affect (among other aspects of our business) the demand for and claims made under our products, the ability of customers, counterparties, and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources, the availability of reinsurance protection, the risks we assume under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, and our investment performance. The increasing impact of climate change could affect our cost of claims, loss ratios, and financial results. Volatility in the U.S. and other securities markets may adversely affect our stock price.\n\nA decline in our financial strength ratings could affect our standing among distribution partners and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease. A decline in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and impact our ability to access capital markets.\n\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. The objective of these rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. A ratings downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as insureds, ceding companies, and brokers move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher ratings. If one or more of our debt ratings were downgraded, we could also incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. Additionally, we could be required to post collateral or be faced with the cancellation of policies and resulting premium in certain circumstances. We cannot give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent any of the rating agencies might downgrade our ratings in the future.\n\nOur ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure.\n\nChubb Limited is a holding company that owns shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries along with several loans receivable from affiliates. Beyond this it does not itself have any significant operations or liquid assets. Repayment of loans receivable, guarantee fees and dividends and other permitted distributions from subsidiaries are its primary sources of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments, other expenses, repurchases of its shares, and paying dividends to our shareholders. Some of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends (or other intercompany amounts due, such as intercompany debt obligations) in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to repurchase shares and pay dividends to our shareholders.\n\nSwiss law imposes certain restrictions on our ability to repurchase our shares.\n\nSwiss law imposes certain withholding tax and other restrictions on a Swiss company’s ability to return earnings or capital to its shareholders, including through the repurchase of its own shares. We may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves are available. In addition, Swiss law requires that the total par value of Chubb's treasury shares must not be in excess of 10 percent of its total share capital, although, to the extent permitted by Swiss law, exemptions from the 10 percent limit apply for repurchased treasury shares dedicated for cancellation under our shareholder-approved capital band or for shares acquired pursuant to a shareholder-ratified repurchase program and dedicated for cancellation. As a result, in order to maintain our share repurchase program, our shareholders must either periodically approve our capital band authorizing our Board to reduce our share capital or, as necessary, ratify our share repurchase program authorizing our Board to acquire shares in excess of the 10 percent limit. If our shareholders do not approve either of the foregoing, we may be restricted or unable to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases in the future. Furthermore, our current repurchase program relies on bank counterparties for execution and Swiss tax rulings confirmed by the competent tax authority for a certain period. \n\n26\n\n\nWe can re-apply for such tax rulings in the future but cannot guarantee that they will also be granted going forward. Any future revocation, lapse, expiration, or loss of our Swiss tax rulings or the inability to conduct repurchases in accordance with these rulings could jeopardize our ability to continue repurchasing our shares.\n\nOur operating results and shareholders' equity may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. \n\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. In general, we match assets and liabilities in local currencies. Where possible, capital levels in local currencies are limited to satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk are the Korean won, Chinese yuan renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, British pound sterling, Hong Kong dollar, Thai baht, New Taiwan dollar, and euro. At December 31, 2024, approximately 29.9 percent of our unhedged net assets were denominated in foreign currencies. We may experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of non-U.S. currencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOperational\n\nThe regulatory and political regimes under which we operate, and their volatility, could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nWe may from time to time face challenges resulting from changes in applicable law and regulations in particular jurisdictions, or changes in approach to oversight of our business from insurance or other regulators.\n\nOur insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally. Our businesses in each jurisdiction are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things, maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus, and liquidity, various solvency standards, and periodic examinations of subsidiaries' financial condition. In some jurisdictions, laws and regulations also restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, to make certain investments, and to distribute funds. The purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect policyholders and ceding insurance companies, not our shareholders. For example, some jurisdictions have enacted various consumer protection laws that make it more burdensome for insurance companies to sell policies and interact with customers in personal lines businesses. Failure to comply with such regulations can lead to significant penalties and reputational injury.\n\nThe non-U.S. and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Laws and regulations not specifically related to the insurance industry include trade sanctions that relate to certain countries, anti-money laundering laws, and anti-corruption laws. The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial, and legal developments that may create new and expanded regulations and theories of liability. The current economic and financial climates present additional uncertainties and risks relating to increased regulation and the potential for increased involvement of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry.\n\nRegulators in countries where we have operations continue to work with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including with respect to group supervision and solvency requirements. The IAIS has developed a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame), which is focused on the effective group-wide supervision of international active insurance groups (IAIGs), such as Chubb. The IAIS also implements the Holistic Framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk. As part of ComFrame, in December 2024, the IAIS adopted an international capital standard (ICS) for such IAIGs and concluded that the Aggregation Method developed by the U.S. provides a basis for implementation of the ICS to produce comparable outcomes. Starting in 2027, the IAIS will initiate detailed jurisdictional assessments of ICS implementation. In addition, Chubb businesses across the European Union (EU) are subject to Solvency II, a capital and risk management regime, and our Bermuda businesses are subject to an equivalent of the EU's Solvency II regime. Also applicable to Chubb businesses are the requirements of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) whose regulations include Swiss Solvency Tests. There are also Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements in the U.S., which are also subject to revision in response to global developments. The impact to Chubb of these developments remains uncertain.\n\nFurthermore, governments, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders have increased their focus on climate change risk reporting. A variety of governments and regulators have adopted or are in the process of adopting climate change and greenhouse gas emissions disclosure requirements to which Chubb and certain of its individual subsidiaries are or will be subject in the future. Chubb also receives requests for information from investors, customers and other stakeholders from time \n\n27\n\n\nto time on various aspects of its policies and strategies relating to climate change. This has resulted in expanded and increasingly complex expectations related to reporting under multiple, various, disparate and potentially inconsistent reporting requirements, increased due diligence, and potential requirements for the reporting of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Responding to such disclosure requirements and requests involves risks and uncertainties, including dependence in part on estimates and third-party data that are outside our control. New reporting standards, regulations and requirements with various aims and goals could expose us to legal, regulatory, investor and other stakeholder scrutiny, and customers that disagree with our actions or reporting on climate change may determine not to do business with us, all of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nEvolving privacy, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI) regulations could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees, including in relation to medical records, credit card data and financial information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, sometimes conflict, and could expose Chubb to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, litigation or claims, and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.\n\nFor example, we are subject to the New York Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Regulation (the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation) which mandates detailed cybersecurity standards and other obligations for all institutions, including insurance entities, authorized by the NYDFS to operate in New York. The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation has increased our compliance costs and could increase the risk of noncompliance and subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputation risk.\n\nAdditionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which requires licensed insurance entities to comply with detailed information security requirements. A number of states have enacted it into law, and it is not yet known whether or not, and to what extent, additional states will enact it. Such enactments, especially if inconsistent between states or with existing laws and regulations, could raise compliance costs or increase the risk of noncompliance, with the attendant risk of being subject to regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputational harm.\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) is a comprehensive regulation applying across all EU member states. All our business units (regardless of whether they are located in the EU) may be subject to the GDPR when personal data is processed in relation to the offer of goods and services to individuals within the EU. Our failure to comply with GDPR and other countries’ privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations could result in significant penalties imposed by regulators, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nSignificant other comprehensive privacy laws have been enacted by other jurisdictions, most notably the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados (LGPD), which may affect our use of data and could affect our operations and subject us to fines and actions for noncompliance. In the U.S., several other states are considering similar legislation, and there are ongoing discussions regarding a U.S. National Privacy Law. New laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA are expected to be enacted in coming years in various countries and jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nRegulatory standards relating to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) are evolving in the countries where we do business, and may increase risks associated with bias, unfair discrimination, transparency, and information security. State insurance regulators in the U.S. have issued and will continue to consider regulations or guidelines on the use of external data, algorithms, and AI in insurance practices. The European Parliament and European Council have also promulgated the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, which will regulate the use of AI within the European Union. The application of existing law and introduction of new or revised laws and regulations may require changes in our operations, increase compliance costs and reduce benefits from our adoption of artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nOur worldwide operations, particularly in developing nations, expose us to global geopolitical developments that could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nWith operations in 54 countries and territories, we provide insurance and reinsurance products and services to a diverse group of clients worldwide, including operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable geopolitical developments, including law changes; tax changes; changes in trade policies; changes to visa or immigration policies; regulatory restrictions; government leadership changes; political events and upheaval; sociopolitical instability; social, political or economic instability resulting from climate change; and nationalization of our \n\n28\n\n\noperations without compensation. Adverse activity in any one country could negatively impact operations, increase our loss exposure under certain of our insurance products, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition, depending on the magnitude of the events and our net financial exposure at that time in that country.\n\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, including due to security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage our reputation, and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets, including in our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers. Our business depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business. Our ability to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data we maintain, including that within our information systems, as well as data in and assets held through third-party service providers and systems. Like all global companies, our systems and those of our third-party service providers, have been, and will likely continue to be, targeted by or subject to viruses, malware or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, cyber frauds, ransomware or other unauthorized occurrences, on or conducted through our information systems, which jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information or information systems. Cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cybersecurity threats can originate from a wide variety of sources including terrorists, nation states, financially motivated actors, internal actors, or third parties, such as external service providers, and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks, which include the deployment of artificial intelligence by bad actors intent on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, use of \"deep fakes,\" and long-term persistent attacks. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken protective actions designed to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect our information technology and assets, including conducting due diligence security reviews and negotiating agreements with third-party service providers, and we additionally endeavor to modify such procedures and agreements as circumstances warrant, such measures may be insufficient to prevent cybersecurity events, which may include unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code or cyber-attack, ransomware, phishing scams, or similar attempts to fraudulently induce our employees or others to take actions that compromise our information or information systems, business compromise attacks, catastrophic events, system failures and disruptions, employee errors, negligence or malfeasance, loss of assets or data and other events that could have security consequences. As the breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure continues to grow, the risk of a cybersecurity event increases. Such an event or events may jeopardize Chubb's or its clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored within Chubb, and transmitted through its information systems, or otherwise cause interruptions, delays, or malfunctions in Chubb's, its clients', its counterparties', or third parties' operations, or result in data loss or loss of assets that could result in significant losses, reputational damage or an adverse effect on our operations and critical business functions. Chubb may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and to pursue recovery of lost data or assets and we may be subject to litigation costs and losses, regulatory penalties (as described above) and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained. In instances where we rely on third parties to perform business functions and process data on our behalf, Chubb may be exposed to additional data security risk as a result of cybersecurity events that impact the third party or others upon whom they rely.\n\nDespite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place and our efforts to observe the regulatory requirements surrounding information security, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption of the infrastructure that supports our business in the communities in which we are located, or of outsourced services or functions. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation, or other services used by Chubb or third parties on which we rely. If a disruption occurs in one location and Chubb employees in that location are unable to conduct business, communicate with, or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with clients may suffer.\n\nWe use analytical models to assist our decision-making in key areas, such as underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risks, but actual results could differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.\n\nWe use various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. We use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making (e.g., underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk) and to maintain competitive advantage. The modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and \n\n29\n\n\nindustry data. In addition, the modeled outputs and related analyses may from time to time contain inaccuracies, perhaps in material respects, including as a result of inaccurate inputs or applications thereof. Climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or underestimate the frequency or severity of loss events, or overestimate the risks we are exposed to, new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct or grow our business. This risk may be particularly acute for us relative to some of our competitors because some of our senior executives work in countries where they are not citizens, and work permit and immigration issues could adversely affect the ability to retain or hire key persons. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our employees.\n\nOperational risk from internal system and process failures, human errors and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nLosses may result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with underwriting or other internal guidelines, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions that we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Resultant losses could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nStrategic\n\nThe continually changing landscape, including competition, technology and products, and existing and new market entrants could reduce our margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nInsurance and reinsurance markets are highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S., Bermuda, European, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and management resources than we do. In addition, capital market participants have created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. We also compete with new companies and existing companies that move into the insurance and reinsurance markets. If competition, or technological or other changes to the insurance markets in which we operate, limits our ability to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Increased competition could also result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce our profit margins and adversely impact our net income and shareholders' equity.\n\nRecent technological advancements in the insurance industry and information technology industry present new and fast-evolving competitive risks as participants seek to increase transaction speeds, lower costs, and create new opportunities. Advancements in technology are occurring in underwriting, claims, distribution, and operations at a pace that may quicken, including as companies increase use of data analytics, AI and other technology as part of their business strategy. We will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than us in their utilization of technology and evolving data analytics. If we do not anticipate or keep pace with these technological and other changes impacting the insurance industry, it could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInsurance and reinsurance markets are historically cyclical, and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.\n\nThe insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms, and fewer submissions for our underwriting services. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance markets significantly, as could periods of economic weakness (such as recession).\n\n30\n\n\nThe integration of acquired companies may not be as successful as we anticipate.\n\nAcquisitions involve numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax, and other risks, potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of acquired businesses’ internal controls over financial reporting. Difficulties in integrating an acquired company, along with its personnel, may result in the acquired company performing differently than we expected, in operational challenges or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. This may also apply to companies in which we acquire majority ownership. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. In addition, goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with insurance company acquisitions may be impaired if premium growth, underwriting profitability, agency retention and policy persistency, among other factors, differ from expectations.\n\nThere is also the potential that proposed acquisitions that have been publicly announced will not be consummated, even if a definitive agreement has been signed by the parties. If an agreement is terminated before closing, the result would be that our proposed acquisition would not occur, which could, among other things, expose us to damages or liability and adversely impact our stock price and future operations.\n\nWe may be subject to U.S. tax and Bermuda tax which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and shareholders' equity.\n\nChubb Limited and our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate such that none of these companies should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income), because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S., we cannot be certain that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not contend successfully that Chubb Limited or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. If Chubb Limited or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case our results of operations and our shareholders' equity could be adversely affected.\n\nHistorically, our Bermuda operations have not been subject to Bermuda income tax. However, on December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted a 15 percent income tax effective January 1, 2025. \n\nThe new Bermuda income tax will be a covered tax under the OECD’s global minimum tax regime discussed in our Risk Factor below titled “The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Union (EU), Swiss Federal Council, and other jurisdictions are considering, have considered, or have passed measures that might change long standing tax principles that could increase our taxes.” Therefore, we would expect any implementation of the OECD global minimum tax regime to count any current Bermuda income tax toward such OECD minimum tax.\n\nThe imposition of the Bermuda corporate income tax will increase our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid beginning in 2025.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by certain features of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 (H.R. 5376). Key tax provisions included in the Inflation Reduction Act include a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average profits over $1 billion, and a 1 percent excise tax on repurchases of corporate stock. The CAMT and the excise tax on share repurchases are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Since enactment, the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department have issued final and proposed regulations and notices, interpreting and implementing the new provisions. Guidance on rules implementing the Inflation Reduction Act is not yet final in some areas; there are many uncertainties relating to its ultimate application and effects on our company.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Union (EU), Swiss Federal Council, and other jurisdictions are considering, have considered, or have passed measures that might change long standing tax principles that could increase our taxes.\n\nThe OECD has published a framework for taxation that in many respects is different than long standing international tax principles. This framework, along with related administrative guidance, could redefine what income is taxed in which country and institute a 15 percent global minimum tax in 2024 or later years. To date, many EU and other countries have enacted the 15 percent global minimum tax. Switzerland has enacted aspects of these rules, effective on January 1, 2025, including the income inclusion rule but not the under taxed profits rule.\n\n31\n\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the OECD issued administrative guidance that, if incorporated into law, could cause additional tax to be payable to the extent the deferred tax asset we established upon enactment of Bermuda’s corporate income tax in 2023 reverses after 2026. It is uncertain at this time whether and to what extent the jurisdictions in which we operate will implement this guidance.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum announcing that the OECD framework has “no force or effect in the United States” and disavowing any commitments previously made by the United States with respect to the framework. The memorandum also directs the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to develop and present to President Trump a list of protective measures or other options towards foreign countries that are either not in compliance with any tax treaty with the United States or have tax rules that are “extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies.” The possible uneven enactment of the OECD framework by various jurisdictions coupled with the United States’ response to these rules could cause uncertainties to and increases in our income taxes.\n\nSeveral multilateral organizations, including the EU and the OECD have, in recent years, expressed concern about some countries not participating in adequate tax information exchange arrangements and have threatened those that do not agree to cooperate with punitive sanctions by member countries. It is still unclear what all these sanctions might be, which countries might adopt them, and when or if they might be imposed. We cannot provide assurance that the Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) that have been entered into by Switzerland and Bermuda will be sufficient to preclude the sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect us.\n\nShareholders\n\nThere are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce the voting rights and diminish the value of our Common Shares.\n\nOur Articles of Association generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each Common Share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. However, the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold 10 percent or more of the voting power conferred by our Common Shares. Moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. The Board of Directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds, including if the holder would, directly or indirectly, formally, constructively or beneficially own (as described in Articles 8 and 14 of our Articles of Association) or otherwise control voting rights with respect to 10 percent or more of the registered share capital recorded in the commercial register. In addition, the Board of Directors shall reject entry of holders of registered shares as shareholders with voting rights in the share register or shall decide on their deregistration when the acquirer or shareholder upon request does not expressly state that she/he has acquired or holds the shares in her/his own name and for her/his account.\n\nApplicable laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company.\n\nBefore a person can acquire control of an insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the U.S. state or the regulator of the applicable country where the insurer is domiciled. The regulator may consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant's Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, U.S. state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the U.S. insurer. Because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our Common Shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. Although our Articles of Association may limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than 10 percent, applicable regulators may not agree that a shareholder that owned 10 percent or more of our Common Shares did not, because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares, control the applicable insurance subsidiary. Laws of other jurisdictions in which one or more of our existing companies are, or a future affiliate may be, organized or domiciled may contain similar restrictions on the acquisition of control of Chubb.\n\nThese laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of Chubb, including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.\n\n32\n\n\nShareholder voting requirements under Swiss law may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\n\nSwiss law allows our shareholders to authorize the Board of Directors to issue new shares within a pre-defined range under our capital band without further shareholder approval. Because such capital band is limited in duration, the authorization must be periodically renewed by our shareholders. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility as other jurisdictions in the various terms that can attach to different classes of stock and reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions that are not reserved for shareholders in other jurisdictions, such as approval of dividends. We cannot provide assurance that Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will not have an adverse effect on Chubb or our shareholders.\n\nChubb Limited is a Swiss company; it may be difficult to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers.\n\nChubb Limited is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Switzerland. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the U.S. and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the U.S. upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nChubb has been advised by its Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to whether the courts in Switzerland would enforce:\n\n•judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws obtained in actions against it or its directors and officers, who reside outside the U.S.; or\n\n•original actions brought in Switzerland against these persons or Chubb predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nChubb has also been advised by its Swiss counsel that there is no treaty in effect between the U.S. and Switzerland providing for this enforcement, and there are grounds upon which Swiss courts may not enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as contrary to that country's public policy.\n\nShareholders may be subject to Swiss withholding taxes on the payment of dividends.\n\nOur dividends are generally subject to a Swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35 percent; however, payment of a dividend in the form of a capital contribution reserve reduction or par value reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. We have previously obtained shareholder approval for dividends to be paid in such form. It is our practice to recommend to shareholders that they annually approve the payment of dividends in such form, but we cannot assure that our shareholders will continue to approve a reduction in such form each year or that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction, or that Swiss withholding tax rules will not be changed in the future. We estimate we would be able to pay dividends in such form, and thus exempt from Swiss withholding tax, until 2028–2033. This range may vary depending upon changes in annual dividends, special dividends, share repurchases, the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate, changes in par value or capital contribution reserves or adoption of changes or new interpretations to Swiss corporate or tax law or regulations.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, U.S. shareholders may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a U.S. person who owns or is deemed to own 10 percent or more of the voting power or value of a foreign corporation that is a “controlled foreign corporation” (CFC) (a foreign corporation in which 10 percent U.S. shareholders own or are deemed to own more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of the stock of a foreign corporation or more than 25 percent of certain foreign insurance corporations) for any period during a taxable year must include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes a pro rata share of the CFC's \"subpart F income\". We believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership it is unlikely that any U.S. person who acquires shares of Chubb Limited directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be required to include any subpart F income in income under the CFC rules of U.S. tax law.\n\nSeparately, any U.S. persons who hold shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on their proportionate share of our Related Person Insurance Income (RPII). If the RPII of any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries (each a \"Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary\") were to equal or exceed 20 percent of that company's gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through foreign entities 20 percent or more of the voting power or value of Chubb Limited, then a U.S. person who owns any shares of Chubb Limited (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in his or her income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such person's pro rata share of such company's RPII for the taxable year. In addition, any RPII that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. We believe that the gross RPII of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary did not in prior years of operation and is not expected in the foreseeable future to equal or exceed 20 percent of each such company's gross insurance \n\n33\n\n\nincome. Likewise, we do not expect the direct or indirect insureds of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary (and persons related to such insureds) to directly or indirectly own 20 percent or more of either the voting power or value of our shares. However, we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of RPII may be beyond our control. If these thresholds are met or exceeded, any U.S. person’s investment in Chubb Limited could be adversely affected. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released proposed regulations that may cause more income to be treated as RPII than under current law.\n\nA U.S. tax-exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our insurance income is allocated to the organization. This generally would be the case if either (i) Chubb Limited is considered a CFC and the tax-exempt shareholder is a 10 percent U.S. shareholder or (ii) there is RPII, certain exceptions do not apply, and the tax-exempt organization, directly (or indirectly through foreign entities) owns any shares of Chubb Limited. Although we do not believe that any U.S. tax-exempt organization should be allocated such insurance income, we cannot be certain that this will be the case. Potential U.S. tax-exempt investors are advised to consult their tax advisors.\n\nU.S. persons who hold shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf Chubb Limited is considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person who holds Chubb Limited shares will be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences in which case their investment could be adversely affected. In addition, if Chubb Limited were considered a PFIC, upon the death of any U.S. individual owning shares, such individual's heirs or estate would not be entitled to a \"step-up\" in the basis of the shares which might otherwise be available under U.S. federal income tax laws. We believe that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure, however, that we will not be deemed a PFIC by the IRS. U.S. federal tax law and final and proposed regulations issued by the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department contain rules that may affect the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors.",
