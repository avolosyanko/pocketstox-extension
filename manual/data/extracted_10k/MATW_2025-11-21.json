Manufactured bronze and\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued)\n\ngranite niche units are comprised of numerous compartments used to display cremation urns in mausoleums and churches. The Company also markets turnkey cremation gardens that include design and all related products for a cremation memorial garden.\n\nCustomers of the Memorialization segment can purchase memorials and vases on a \"pre-need\" basis. This concept permits families to arrange for these purchases in advance of their actual need. Upon request, the Company will manufacture the memorial to the customer's specifications (e. g., name and birth date) and place it in storage for future delivery. Memorials in storage have been paid in full with title conveyed to each pre-need purchaser.\n\nThe segment is a leading manufacturer and distributor of caskets and other funeral home products in North America, producing and marketing metal, wood and cremation caskets. Caskets are offered in a variety of colors, interior designs, handles and trim in order to accommodate specific religious, ethnic or other personal preferences and can also be personalized. The segment is the leading supplier of embalming chemicals, supplies, and instruments in North America. Other specialized funeral home products such as urns, jewelry, interior panels, and stationery are also offered.\n\nMetal caskets are made from various gauges of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze. Metal caskets are generally categorized by whether the casket is non-gasketed or gasketed, and by material (i. e., bronze, copper, or steel) and in the case of steel, by the gauge (thickness) of the metal. Wood caskets are primarily manufactured from nine different species of wood. The species of wood used are poplar, pine, ash, oak, pecan, maple, cherry, walnut and mahogany. The Memorialization segment is a leading manufacturer of all-wood constructed caskets, which are manufactured using pegged and dowelled construction, and include no metal parts. Cremation caskets are made primarily from wood or cardboard covered with cloth or veneer. These caskets appeal primarily to cremation consumers, environmentally concerned consumers and value buyers.\n\nThe Memorialization segment produces casket components, which include stamped metal parts, metal locking mechanisms for gasketed metal caskets and adjustable beds.

These products assist funeral service professionals in providing information, value and satisfaction to their client families.\n\nThe segment offers cremation systems, and cremation service and supplies, to the pet and human sector, and standard and specialized incineration systems. The primary market areas for these products and services are North America and Latin America.\n\nCremation systems include flame-based systems for cremation of humans and pets, as well as equipment for processing the cremated remains and other related equipment (ventilated workstations, loading systems, tables, cooler racks, vacuums). The principal markets for these products are funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories, pet crematories, animal disposers and veterinarians. These products primarily are marketed directly by segment personnel. Cremation service and supplies consist of operator training, preventative maintenance and on-demand service work performed on various makes and models of equipment. This work can be as simple as replacing defective bulbs or as complex as complete reconstruction and upgrading or retrofitting on site. Supplies are consumable items and replacement parts associated with normal crematory operations.\n\nWaste incineration systems encompass both batch-load and continuous-feed systems for incineration of many waste types, as well as mobile incineration systems, plus equipment for in-loading waste and energy recovery. The principal markets for these products are producers and disposers of low-volume, high-value waste streams, including industrial and hazardous wastes; contraband and pharmaceuticals; animal, medical and pathological wastes; confidential waste and wastes from remote operating sites.

BUSINESS, (continued)\n\nproducts are corporations, fraternal organizations, contractors, churches, hospitals, schools and government agencies. These products are sold to and distributed through a network of independent dealers including sign suppliers, awards and recognition companies, and trophy dealers.\n\nRaw materials used by the Memorialization segment to manufacture memorials consist principally of bronze and aluminum ingot, granite, sheet metal, coating materials, photopolymers and construction materials and are generally available in adequate supply. Ingot is obtained from various North American, European and Australian smelters. The primary materials required for casket manufacturing are cold-rolled steel and lumber. The segment also purchases copper, bronze, stainless steel, particleboard, corrugated materials, paper veneer, cloth, ornamental hardware and coating materials. Purchase orders or supply agreements are typically negotiated with steel suppliers that have demonstrated timely delivery, high quality material and competitive prices. Lumber is purchased from a number of sawmills and lumber distributors. Raw materials used to manufacture cremation and incineration products consist principally of structural steel, sheet metal, electrical components, combustion devices and refractory materials. These are generally available in adequate supply from numerous suppliers.\n\nCompetition from other manufacturers of memorial products is based on reputation, product quality, delivery, price, and design availability. The Company believes that its superior quality, broad product lines, innovative designs, delivery capability, customer responsiveness, experienced personnel and consumer-oriented merchandising systems are competitive advantages in its markets. Competition in the mausoleum construction industry includes various construction companies throughout North America and is based on design, quality and price. Competitors in the architectural market are numerous and include companies that manufacture cast and painted signs, plastic materials, sand-blasted wood and other fabricated products.\n\nThe Memorialization segment markets its casket products in the United States through a combination of Company-owned and independent casket distribution facilities. The segment's casket products are primarily sold through Company-owned distribution centers throughout the United States. The casket business is highly competitive and the Company competes with other manufacturers based on product quality, price, service, design availability and breadth of product line. The Memorialization segment provides a line of casket products that it believes is as comprehensive as any of its major competitors. There are a large number of casket industry participants operating in North America, and a few foreign casket manufacturers, primarily from China, participating in the North American market.\n\nThe Company competes with several manufacturers in the cremation and accessory equipment market principally based on product design, quality and price. The Memorialization segment and its three largest global competitors account for a substantial portion of the United States and European cremation equipment market.\n\nThe Memorialization segment works to provide a total solution to customers that own and operate businesses in both the cemetery and funeral home markets. The Company's memorial and casket products serve the relatively stable casketed and in-ground burial death market, while its memorial products and cremation and incineration equipment also serve the growing cremation market.\n\nIndustrial Technologies:\n\nThe Industrial Technologies segment includes the design, manufacturing, service and sales of high-tech custom energy storage solutions; product identification and warehouse automation technologies and solutions, including order fulfillment systems for identifying, tracking, picking and conveying consumer and industrial products; and coating and converting lines for the packaging, pharma, foil, décor and tissue industries.\n\nThe energy storage solutions business produces engineered calendering, laminating, and coating equipment used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries and components of fuel cells. The segment currently delivers products to major vehicle producers and tier 1 battery manufacturers.

The business supplies high-tech machines to large global customers and develops solutions collaboratively with them to make their processes more resource-efficient and their products more sustainable.\n\nProduction capabilities are available in Germany, the Czech Republic and the United States, with design and assembly in Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the United States. The business is globally active with well-established customer relations.\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued)\n\nThe energy storage solutions business has grown over the last few years, primarily reflecting demand for batteries for use in electric vehicles. The segment has over a decade of experience in developing dry electrode battery solutions. Dry electrode technology makes producing lithium-ion batteries less expensive than the wet electrode process, and is also more environmentally sustainable. These factors could contribute to increased utilization of dry electrode batteries in the electric vehicle market, and thus greater demand for this form of battery production in the future.\n\nProduct identification systems range from stand-alone marking products to complex ink-jet printing systems that integrate into a customer's production process. The Company manufactures and markets products and systems that employ different marking technologies, including laser and ink-jet printing. These technologies apply product information required for identification and traceability, as well as to facilitate inventory and quality control, regulatory compliance and brand name communication. The segment also develops innovative, custom solutions to address specific customer requirements in a variety of industries, including oil field services and security scanning.\n\nWarehouse automation systems provide the tracking and distribution of a customer's products with software for warehouse execution systems (\"WES\") and warehouse control systems (\"WCS\"), order fulfillment technologies, and controls for material handling systems. The fulfillment technologies automate picking, kitting, sorting, assembly, and other material handling tasks. Customers for this business include some of the largest retail, e-commerce, and third-party logistics companies in the United States.\n\nA portion of the revenue of the Industrial Technologies segment is attributable to the sale of consumables and replacement parts required by the marking, coding and tracking products sold by Matthews. The Company develops inks exclusively for the use with its marking equipment, which is critical to ensure ongoing equipment reliability and mark quality.\n\nThe principal customers for the Company's marking and fulfillment systems products are manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of durable goods, building products, consumer goods manufacturers (including food and beverage processors) and producers of pharmaceuticals. The Company also serves a wide variety of industrial markets, including metal fabricators, manufacturers of woven and non-woven fabrics, plastic, rubber and automotive products.\n\nA portion of this segment's sales are outside the United States, sourced through the Company's subsidiaries in Sweden, Germany, Malaysia and China in addition to other international distributors. The Company owns a minority interest in distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe.\n\nMajor raw materials for this segment's products include precision components, electronics, printing components, chemicals, steel, copper, and film all of which are presently available in adequate supply from various sources.\n\nCompetitors in the marking and fulfillment systems industries are diverse, with some companies offering limited product lines for well-defined specialty markets, while others operate similarly to the Company, offering a broad product line and competing in multiple product markets and countries. Competitive differentiation for marking and fulfillment systems products is based on product performance, ease of integration into the manufacturing and/or distribution process, service and price. The Company typically competes with specialty companies in specific brand marking solutions and traceability applications. In the energy storage solutions business, the Company has patents and pending patent applications on its dry electrode calendering equipment. The Company believes that, in general, its Industrial Technologies segment offers one of the broadest lines of products to address a wide variety of high-tech custom energy storage solutions, product identification and warehouse automation applications.\n\nBrand Solutions:\n\nThe Brand Solutions segment historically provided brand management, pre-media services, printing plates and cylinders, imaging services, digital asset management, merchandising display systems, and marketing and design services primarily for the consumer goods and retail industries. On May 1, 2025, the Company contributed the vast majority of its Brand Solutions segment (the “ SGK Business”) to a newly-formed entity, Propelis, in exchange for a 40% ownership interest in Propelis and other consideration. Following the completion of this transaction, the Company's Brand Solutions segment consists of its cylinders business, and its 40% ownership interest in Propelis.\n\nPropelis was formed through the merger of the SGK Business with SGS & Co., and is a leading global provider of brand solutions. Its broad range of integrated solutions include brand creative, packaging, print solutions, branded environments, and content production. Services are delivered through its family of brands: SGX, Marks, Equator, Collide, and 5Flow. With a combined legacy spanning more than 150 years, Propelis has approximately 10,000 employees in 30+ countries, nearly $1 billion in annual sales, and a diverse client base of over 2,000 leading companies.\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued)\n\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES:\n\nThe Company holds a number of trademarks and in excess of 100 domestic and foreign patents for its products and related technologies. In addition, the Company maintains numerous trade secrets that further comprise its portfolio of intellectual property assets. The Company continues to assess, refine and expand its intellectual property portfolio, considering options to pursue additional patent filings and to further develop and continue to maintain processes to identify, inventory and safeguard evolving trade secrets and other intellectual property assets. The Company also enters into agreements with customers that authorize the use of certain intellectual property through various licensing arrangements.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Company’s culture of Inspired Possibilities empowers global teams to think creatively to inspire change that favorably impacts outcomes for the Company's customers, clients, and one another. Matthews’ human resource strategies align with the business strategies to enable and optimize internal talent to achieve business and financial performance. At every stage of the employee lifecycle, the Company’s people programs are rooted in a set of organizational competencies and capabilities, aligned with the Company's core values, that collectively build talent, enhance employee engagement, sustain retention, inspire innovation and drive results.\n\nWorkforce Composition:\n\nAs of October 31, 2025, the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries employed over 5,500 people globally in four continents and more than 145 locations and 18 countries around the world. Its diverse team of talented employees possesses a vast array of skills, including engineering, manufacturing, research and development, plant operations, production, logistics, creative design, and corporate functional services, including legal, information technology, human resources and finance. Many of Matthews’ employees have highly specialized skills and subject-matter expertise in their respective disciplines, enabling the Company to deliver industry leading products and services to its customers throughout the world.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion:\n\nMatthews views diversity and inclusion (“ D& I”) as a priority to be valued and promoted in every aspect of its business. The Company understands and firmly believes in the value that diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas bring to the workforce and offer to clients. Matthews knows its employees deserve equal opportunities regardless of race, gender, gender expression, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation and more. Matthews has consistently advocated that mutual respect, valuing the worth of all people, doing what's right and celebrating diversity is essential to how the Company operates and the way it does business.\n\nAligned and designed to optimize the Company's HR Strategy, the D& I programming embraces, encourages, and enhances Matthews as an organization that is diverse in culture, talent, and geography. The program focuses on priorities across four key pillars: Infrastructure, Employee Engagement, Talent Acquisition, and Community. Central to these efforts is representing the Company’s diversity across businesses, regions, and cultures. Additional efforts include awareness and education programs, Employee Resource Groups (“ ERGs”), and external partnerships that strengthen recruiting and professional development opportunities. The Company stands committed to a culture reflecting the people, clients, customers, and communities it serves.\n\nTalent Acquisition and Total Rewards:\n\nTo continue to grow and compete in a highly competitive labor market, Matthews works hard to attract and select top talent through a compelling employment value proposition. The Company’s employment brand highlights its values including innovation, commitment to people culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee growth, and wellbeing. The Company’s selection process includes key behavioral questions that help select the right people for the right roles which helps ensure cultural alignment.\n\nMatthews understands the highly competitive market for talent and believes that to attract and retain top talent, it must offer a comprehensive total rewards package. This encompasses compensation, benefits, and wellbeing programs designed to align with local regulations, market practices, and regional needs. The Company evaluates roles to ensure pay is at market rate and offers annual incentive programs. As a global company, adjustments are made for global and regional market demands.\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS, (continued)\n\nTalent Management:\n\nFrom onboarding to leadership development, Matthews believes that investing in its people leads to greater success. The Company’s onboarding program reinforces its values and culture, supports its managers in creating a positive employee experience and rapid assimilation during the first 90 days which builds early commitment with all new hires.\n\nMatthews knows that when employees have opportunities to learn and grow, see how their goals and objectives lead to something greater and understand their part in the organization’s success, it helps build a place where people want to stay. Matthews’ globally accessible learning hub is a gateway to personal growth and professional development that allows employees to:\n\n• Explore personalized learning opportunities tailored to specific needs and career aspirations.\n\n• Access a wide range of learning resources on demand, designed to help prepare employees to meet career aspirations.\n\n•Discover diverse career paths and build the right skills aligned with goals through high-quality content from a variety of sources.\n\n• Enhance skill sets to stay innovative and adaptable in an ever-evolving technological landscape.\n\nMatthews is committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and development, ensuring all employees have the resources and support they need to succeed.\n\nSuccession Management:\n\nThe Company’s future success depends upon tomorrow’s leaders. Succession Planning for senior leaders is a key focus area built on the foundation of a structured talent review process for identifying the key roles critical to future success, and the key talent to achieve success. The outputs of this annual process are presented first to the executive team, which then selects a cohort of future leaders to participate in comprehensive leadership programs designed to prepare leaders for enterprise roles, and then presented to the Matthews Board of Directors. The Company believes this investment, which includes classroom learning, assessments, coaching/mentoring and real-time strategic project application, both strengthens the organization for the future, and deepens the commitment of its top talent to be prepared and ready to assume senior roles.\n\nPerformance Management:\n\nConnecting employees to the Company's strategy ensures individual effort to a larger goal and strengthens commitment to the organization. The Company supports an annual leadership strategy cascade where each segment, division, group and team identifies and aligns goals and objectives which serve as the basis for individual performance objectives, keeping employees firmly connected to the work and the Company’s collective success. This process is rooted in ongoing coaching and feedback, and measures not just what was accomplished, but how it was accomplished because Matthews believes staying true to its values and key behaviors serves clients better, strengthens culture and keeps employees engaged.\n\nChange Management:\n\nMatthews is a constantly evolving multi-national company, leveraging new ways of working to improve its quality, service and delivery systems to better help customers and clients succeed. Building change capability to support employees through changes accelerates new ways of working, minimizes productivity loss, and accelerates adoption of innovations and improvement measures. The Company has a trained global change network embedded in the business to support transformational projects to help realize the goals and benefits of organizational changes.\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety:\n\nThe Company’s leadership team is committed to integrating Environmental, Health, and Safety (\"EHS\") principles into the Company's business strategy and operations, as it is one of the Company’s core values. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of these efforts by meeting with EHS staff to review policies and practices, assess program effectiveness, and evaluate compliance with applicable regulations. Matthews continually improves its EHS management system and performance by setting measurable EHS objectives and targets, regularly reviewing progress, and implementing corrective actions when necessary. A safe and healthy work environment can only be achieved through active participation. Employees at all levels are encouraged and empowered to report hazards, participate in safety programs, and suggest improvements.\n\nITEM 1.

Risks associated with the Company’s international sales and operations include, but are not limited to:\n\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n• global political and economic instability and uncertainty;\n\n• international terrorism;\n\n• export controls, including by the United States;\n\n• failure to comply with anti-bribery legislation, including the U. S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “ FCPA”);\n\n• changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\n• policy changes by the United States and foreign governments affecting the markets for the Company’s products;\n\n• changes in tax laws, quotas, tariffs and other market barriers;\n\n• difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\n• restrictions on the export or import of technology;\n\n• failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws, including theEuropean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “ GDPR”);\n\n• failure to comply with foreign sustainability-related reporting requirements, including the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive;\n\n• inadvertent transfers of export-controlled information due to increased cross-border technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers;\n\n• transportation, including piracy in international waters;\n\n• competition from foreign businesses that do not have access to U. S. markets; and\n\n• challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures, backgrounds and labor laws.\n\nIt also is possible that certain international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations (known as offset obligations) and may provide for penalties if the Company fails to meet such requirements.\n\nThe impact of these risks is difficult to predict, but the occurrence of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenue, cash flows and financial results. Production and sales of a significant portion of the Company's products are outside the United States, and accordingly, the Company holds assets, incurs liabilities, earns revenue and pays expenses in a variety of currencies. The Company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U. S. dollars, and therefore, the Company must translate the reported values of its foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U. S. dollars. Increases or decreases in the value of the U. S. dollar compared to foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in the Company's consolidated financial statements, even though their value has not changed in local currency.\n\nInterest rate fluctuations could increase the Company's financing costs and reduce the Company's ability to obtain additional indebtedness or debt refinancing, which could materially and adversely affect the Company. Interest rate fluctuations could increase the Company's financing costs to the extent such interest rates are not hedged. In addition, increases in interest rates could limit the Company's ability to obtain additional indebtedness or debt refinancing on terms that the Company deems attractive, or at all, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's borrowing costs, profitability, liquidity and capital resources. Borrowings under the Company’s credit facilities, including the domestic credit\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nfacility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose the Company to interest rate risk. The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to achieve a mix of fixed and variable rate debt that it deems appropriate. To the extent that some or all of the Company’s variable interest rate debt is not subject to interest rate swaps, if interest rates were to increase, the Company’s interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments.\n\nThe Company also has $300.0 million 8.625% senior secured second lien notes due October 1, 2027 (the \"2027 Senior Secured Notes\"). In the event the Company seeks to refinance indebtedness under the domestic credit facility or the 2027 Senior Secured Notes, or obtain additional financing, higher interest rates may limit the Company’s ability to incur such indebtedness on terms that it deems attractive, if at all. If the Company is unable to incur indebtedness on terms that it deems attractive, it could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s borrowing costs, profitability, liquidity and capital resources.\n\nIncreased prices for raw materials or shortages could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. The Company's profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of its products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including changes in supply and demand, domestic and global economic conditions, volatility in commodity markets, currency exchange rates, labor costs, tariffs and fuel-related costs. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, alternative sources of supply or alternative materials may not exist or be readily available. In addition, disruptions in the global supply chain may cause prices for raw materials to increase. See \"The Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services.\"\n\nThe Company has standard selling price structures (i. e., list prices) in certain of its segments, which are reviewed for adjustment generally on an annual basis. In addition, the Company has established pricing terms with several of its customers through contracts or similar arrangements. Based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the Company has established pricing terms with customers, the Company's ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited. Significant raw material price increases that cannot be mitigated by selling price increases or productivity improvements will negatively affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nChanges to U. S. trade policy, including new or increased tariffs and changing import/export regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results. Changes in U. S. or international social, political, regulatory or economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, and any potential negative sentiment toward the U. S. as a result of such changes, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business. The U. S. has instituted certain changes, and has proposed additional changes, in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U. S., and other government regulations affecting trade between the U. S. and other countries (such as the European Union, China, Canada and Mexico) where the Company conducts its business. For example, on April 2, 2025, the U. S. government announced a 10% tariff on product imports from almost all countries and individualized higher tariffs on certain other countries. While several tariff announcements have been followed by announcements of limited exemptions and temporary pauses, global trade disruption, significant introductions of trade barriers and bilateral trade frictions, together with any future downturns in the global economy resulting therefrom, could further materially and adversely affect the Company's financial performance.\n\nAs a result of policy changes and government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic deterrents on international trade. New tariffs and other changes in U. S. trade policy have triggered retaliatory actions by affected countries and may trigger additional retaliatory actions in the future, and foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on U. S. goods. Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U. S. economy, the industries in which the Company operates, and the global demand for its products, and as a result, could have a negative impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company's balance sheet includes a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact the Company's consolidated results of operations and total assets. The Company has recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets in its consolidated financial statements resulting from acquisition activities and has in the past recorded, and may in the future record, significant charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company tests, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. For example, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, Matthews recorded a $16.7 million goodwill write-down with respect to its Surfaces and Engineering reporting unit. See Note 24, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" in Item 8 - “ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details. If Matthews concludes that any further goodwill or intangible asset values are impaired, for reasons that may include, but are not limited to, underperformance in one or more reporting segments against\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nforecast levels; changes in the Company’s business strategy, structure, and/or the allocation of resources; the inability of acquisitions to achieve expected operating results; a decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; a potential recession or other disruption; or interest rate increases or other factors, any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Matthews’ business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in mortality and cremation rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flows and revenues. Generally, life expectancy in the United States and other countries in which the Company's Memorialization segment operates has increased steadily for several decades and is expected to continue to do so in the future, absent events related to pandemics or similar outbreaks. The increase in life expectancy is also expected to impact the timing of deaths in the future. Additionally, cremations have steadily grown as a percentage of total deaths in the United States since the 1960's, and are expected to continue to increase in the future. The Company expects that these trends will continue in the future and sales of the Company's Memorialization segment may benefit from the continued growth in the number of cremations; however, such trends may adversely affect the volume of bronze and granite memorialization products and burial caskets sold in the United States.\n\nThe Company is subject to competitive pressures, including with respect to product demand and pricing. The Company's businesses have and will continue to operate in competitive markets. Changes in product demand or pricing are affected by domestic and foreign competition and an increase in consolidated purchasing by large customers operating in both domestic and global markets. The Memorialization businesses generally operate in markets with ample supply capacity and demand which is correlated to death rates. Additionally, in recent years the Company has witnessed an increase in products manufactured offshore, primarily in China, and imported into the Company's U. S. markets. It is expected that these trends will continue and may affect the Company's future results of operations.\n\nThe loss of any of the Company's large customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flows and results of operations. Although the Company does not have any customer that is individually significant to consolidated sales, it does have contracts with several large customers in each of its business segments. While these contracts provide important access to large purchasers of the Company's products, they can obligate the Company to sell products at contracted prices for extended periods of time, or, in the event of a dispute with a large customer, cause disruptions to the units sold to such customer, if any. Additionally, any significant divestiture of business properties or operations by current customers could result in a loss of business if the Company is not able to maintain the business with the subsequent owners of the businesses.\n\nThe Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services. The Company purchases components and materials to manufacture its products from a large number of suppliers, some of which may be critical to operations. The Company’s product offerings are impacted by such suppliers' lead times, volume constraints and increasing costs. The Company has experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times and product unavailability due to manufacturing disruptions or closures as well as delays and unanticipated costs associated with the sourcing of materials. Matthews’ supply chain operations span several geographies globally and are heavily dependent upon third party logistics and transportation services to deliver the Company’s products to customers. Extended lead times and shortages could impair the Company’s ability to meet its customer requirements, require the Company to pay higher prices or incur expedite fees or cause its customers to delay or forgo projects, which would harm Matthews’ business and negatively impact the Company’s gross margin and results of operations.\n\nPandemics or similar outbreaks may cause unfavorable economic or market conditions, which could impact demand patterns, access to capital and/or disrupt global supply chains and manufacturing operations. Pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely affect the economies of developed and emerging markets, potentially resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers’ demand for the Company’s products and services, as well as the Company's ability to access capital at acceptable interest rates. The spread of pandemics or similar outbreaks may also disrupt the Company’s manufacturing and production operations, as well as its distribution systems, which include import and export for delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See also \"The Company faces additional global supply chain risks and risks of interruption of requisite logistics and transportation services, including as a result of the Company's reliance on limited suppliers and vendors for certain components, materials, and services.\"\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nDue to the uncertainty relating to a pandemic or similar outbreak, the Company, its customers or its suppliers may be required, or believe that it is advantageous, to take precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of a virus or disease spreading to employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate, and these measures could negatively impact the Company’s business. Further, if the scope and severity of an outbreak worsens and the Company’s contingency plans prove ineffective, its global operations could potentially experience disruptions, such as temporary closure of facilities or delays or suspensions in product offerings and services, which may materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nGlobal conflicts may impact the Company's business and the markets in which the Company operates. Global conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, could impact the Company and its operations in a number of different ways, which are yet to be fully assessed and are therefore uncertain. The Company’s principal concern is for the safety of its employees and other personnel, specifically those who are based in the affected region. The Company has employees who are based in Eastern Europe, including Russia, who may be affected by the ongoing hostilities. The Company additionally has property, plant and equipment in or around the affected region. The continuing impact of this war and the response of the United States and other countries to it by means of trade and economic sanctions, or other actions, is still evolving and unknown; however it could disrupt the Company’s ability to work with certain parties. Similarly, the Company has employees based in the affected region and works with third-party providers from other parts of the world that may be affected by hostilities.\n\nUncertainty relating to war or similar conflicts, including the current war between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect the Company's business, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and business and consumer spending; disruptions to the Company's global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; disruptions in global supply chains; exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Similar uncertainties may arise in connection with other ongoing hostilities or future hostilities.\n\nWhile the hostilities continue, and perhaps even thereafter, the Company may see increased volatility in financial markets, which may impact equity markets generally, including the Company’s stock price, and make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital at a strategically advantageous time or to obtain financing upon acceptable terms. All or any of these risks, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nThe Company faces risks in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and business combinations, including the Company's ability to identify or successfully complete any such acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations, to effectively integrate acquired businesses or to effectively manage the remaining business or the combined business. The Company has evolved, in part, through acquisitions and continues to evaluate acquisition, divestiture and business combination opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its businesses, and any such future acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations may be material. There is no assurance, however, that future acquisition, divestiture or business combination opportunities will arise, or that if they do, that they will be consummated. In addition, acquisition, divestitures and business combinations involve inherent risks that the businesses acquired, or the combined or remaining business, will not perform in accordance with expectations, or that synergies expected from an acquisition, divestiture or business combination will not be achieved as rapidly as expected, or at all. The Company's pre-transaction diligence review may not discover or accurately quantify certain undisclosed liabilities, and the Company may not be indemnified for such liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on the acquired business, the remaining business or the combined business. Failure to effectively integrate acquired businesses or effectively manage the remaining business or the combined business could prevent the realization of expected rates of return on the investment, including the achievement of cost-reduction objectives, and could have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could be impacted if its investment in Propelis fails to perform as expected. On May 1, 2025, the Company contributed the vast majority of its Brand Solutions segment to a newly-formed entity, Propelis, in exchange for (i) 40% of the common equity of Propelis, (ii) certain preferred equity interests in Propelis, and (iii) cash consideration. Propelis is unconsolidated with the Company, and the Company is a minority owner therein; as such, the Company is not the ultimate decision-maker with respect to the operations of Propelis or distributions of cash or other property to its unitholders. Propelis’ business is subject to significant risks, including competition from other brand solution providers on the basis of price, requirements from global customers that their suppliers, including Propelis, be global in scope, fluctuations in demand for brand solutions and concentration of product solutions offerings to a single vertical. Should some or all of these risks, or other risks the Company has not yet identified come to fruition, the Company may realize losses related to its investment in Propelis, which could have a material negative effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the Company’s financial results to differ from expectations in any given period or over the long-term.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nIn addition, like all joint ventures, this one involves a number of specific risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following:\n\n•Joint ventures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from the Company’s other operations\n\n• The Company is subject to customary restrictions on the transfer of its equity interests, limiting the Company's ability to dispose of its equity interests in Propelis.\n\n• If there is a change in ownership, a change of control, a change in management or management philosophy, a change in business strategy or another event with respect to the Company’s joint venture partner, it could adversely impact the joint venture and, therefore, adversely impact the Company.\n\n• The Company’s joint venture partner may fail to satisfy contractual obligations.\n\n• Conflicts may arise with the Company’s joint venture partner, related to, for example, the scope of the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of each party in the joint venture.\n\n• The Company’s joint venture partner may be unable or unwilling to support actions that the Company believes are in the best interests of the joint venture or may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company’s interests. These risks are of particular importance given that the Company holds a minority interest in the joint venture.\n\n• The Company’s joint venture partner may take actions that cause harm to the Company’s reputation.\n\nIf the Company is unable to manage its interest in Propelis and realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects, such inability may lead to a material adverse impact on its results of operations.\n\nIf the Company is unable to adequately protect the Company's intellectual property, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Certain of the Company's businesses rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish proprietary rights. If the Company does not enforce, or is unsuccessful in enforcing, its intellectual property rights, its competitive position may suffer, which could harm the Company's operating results and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, the Company's patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including its trade secrets, may not provide a significant competitive advantage. The Company may need to spend significant resources monitoring its intellectual property rights and may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. The Company's competitive position may be harmed if it cannot detect infringement and enforce its intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, the Company may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, such as the expense of litigation against a well-resourced adversary. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around the Company's intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and the Company's ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.\n\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties, including those of Tesla, Inc. (\"Tesla\"), could result in significant costs and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, operating results and reputation. The Company actively manages its businesses to ensure compliance under contractual commitments with its customers, including matters related to intellectual property rights. While the Company believes it has complied with its obligations in this regard and has not infringed on the intellectual property of third parties, the Company cannot ensure that third parties will not assert claims, meritorious or otherwise. For example, while the Company has attempted to work under the terms of its existing contracts with Tesla to affirm the ownership of its intellectual property, in June 2024, Tesla filed a complaint against the Company (the “ Tesla Complaint”) alleging trade secret misappropriations under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (the “ DTSA”) and the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the “ CUTSA”), for breach of contract and unfair business practices relating to the dry battery electrode solutions arising from the Company's advanced rotary processing and calendering technologies. In addition, on February 13, 2025, Tesla filed an additional complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, in part, claims related to correction of inventorship, breach of contract, promissory estoppel and quasi-contract/restitution arising from and/or related to various U. S. patents and provisional patents, including but not limited to U. S. Patent No. 12,136,727. The Company cannot predict whether the assertions in the Tesla Complaint or other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions would substantially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. The defense of these claims, including the Tesla Complaint, and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in the Company's favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute, including the dispute with Tesla, may require the Company to pay damages; cease making, licensing, or using products or offering services that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign the Company's offerings; or enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property, which may be unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in the Company's favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, as well as environmental remediation and compliance that may lead to significant unforeseen expenses. The Company is subject to the risk of environmental liability and limitations on its operations due to environmental laws and regulations. The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal, and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of potentially substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of the Company's business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs. Compliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the Company anticipates, and there is no assurance that significant expenditures related to such compliance will not be required in the future.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability under environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those which may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nThe equity incomethe Company reports from Propelis is reported on a three-month lag basis, which impacts the quarterly and fiscal year timing of when Propelis’ results and synergies are reflected in the Company's financial statements. The Company accounts for the Company's40% interest in Propelis using the equity method of accounting on a three-month lag basis, which impacts the quarterly and fiscal year timing of when Propelis' results and synergies are reflected in the equity income from Propelis included in the Company's financial statements. Propelis' quarterly results are not reflected in the equity income reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements until the Company's quarterly period ending three months after the end of the related Propelis three-month period.\n\nThe Company relies on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including significant information technology services, and the failure of these third parties to provide these services could disrupt the Company's business. The Company has entered into agreements with a variety of third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server maintenance, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, Matthews has agreements through which it has outsourced certain activities related to the operations of the Company’s business segments. A provider’s ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, software errors or design faults, human error, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. If one or more of Matthews’ providers is unable to provide adequate or timely services, the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to customers could be adversely affected. Matthews cannot completely eliminate the risk of such disruptions, many of which are impacted by events outside of the Company’s control. Any significant disruption could harm the Company’s business, including damage to brands and loss of customers. Additionally, although Matthews believes that most of these services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of the providers could cause a material disruption in the Company’s business and an increase in expense while it works to obtain alternative services. Additionally, while the Company has policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing Matthews’ financial, legal, reputational and operational risks.\n\nIf the Company is unable to keep pace with technological changes, some of which are beyond the Company's control, the Company may not be able to maintain the Company's competitive position. The Company operates in certain markets in which technological product development contributes to its ability to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop new products, that new products can be manufactured and marketed profitably, or that new products will successfully meet the expectations of customers.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nChanging laws and regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase the Company's costs, and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant business disruptions, litigation or enforcement actions. The Company is subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the GDPR, which became effective in May of 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), which became effective in January 2020. The GDPR and the CCPA contain comprehensive data protection compliance requirements. Complying with the GDPR and the CCPA may continue to cause the Company to incur substantial operational costs or require the Company to change certain of its business practices in certain jurisdictions. The Company’s measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, could be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. The Company’s ongoing compliance measures could result in the incurrence of significant expense in facilitating and responding to regulatory investigations, and if the measures initiated by the Company are deemed to be inadequate, the Company could be subject to litigation or enforcement actions that may require operational changes, fines, penalties or damages, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business or results of operations.\n\nFuture tax law changes and/or interpretation of existing tax laws may adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and require adjustments to the Company's tax estimates. Matthews is subject to domestic and international tax laws and cannot predict the scope or effect of future tax law changes. Domestically, the U. S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. The Company has applied available guidance to estimate its tax obligations, but new guidance may cause the Company to make adjustments to its tax estimates in future periods.\n\nThe Company operates in a regulated environment that requires the Company's compliance with laws and regulations. Non-compliance could subject the Company to sanctions and materially adversely affect the Company's business. Due to the international scope of the Company's operations, Matthews is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world, and the Company's foreign operations are governed by laws, rules and business practices that often differ from those of the United States. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which the Company's operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company's business and results of operation. For example, recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws and regulations regarding trade compliance, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, and anti-corruption, such as the FCPA and similar laws in other countries. While Matthews maintains a variety of internal policies and controls and takes steps, including periodic training and internal audits, that the Company believes are reasonably calculated to discourage, prevent and detect violations of such laws, the Company cannot guarantee that such actions will be effective or that individual employees will not engage in inappropriate behavior in contravention of the Company's policies and instructions. Such conduct, or even the allegation thereof, could result in costly investigations and the imposition of severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company's business, and could materially and adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. Further, the Company is subject to laws and regulations, worldwide, affecting its operations outside the United States in areas including, but not limited to, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, customs, import and export requirements, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, pensions and social insurance, employment, and environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and requirements may differ across jurisdictions. Further, the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on the Company's business and prospects. In addition, certain laws and regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nRisks Related to the Company'sSecurities:\n\nThe Company's business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders. Activist shareholders have previously nominated candidates for election tothe Company's Board of Directors, resulting in a proxy contest, and may do so again in the future. If the Company becomes engaged in a proxy contest with an activist shareholder in the future, the Company's business could be adversely affected because: responding to public proposals and director nominations, special meeting requests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt the Company's operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company's management and employees; perceived uncertainties as to the Company's future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; cause an event of default under the Company's credit facilities or other agreements due to a change in control (i) if either the Company sustains a series of successful proxy contests or, (ii) if the Company's shareholders approve an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to declassifythe Company's Board of Directors and following such amendment a shareholder successfully engages in a proxy contest; and\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nclaims made by activist shareholders in connection with a proxy contest or otherwise may harm the Company's reputation, damage the Company's relations with customers, employees and business relations such as suppliers, or otherwise impair the Company's business. In addition, pursuit of an activist shareholder’s agenda may adversely affect the Company's ability to effectively implement the Company's business strategy and create additional value for the Company's shareholders. Activist investors may seek to influence the Company's corporate strategy, governance, capital allocation, or structure through public campaigns, proxy contests, or direct engagement with the Company'sBoard of Directors. Whilethe Company values constructive input from shareholders, actions by activist investors could result in significant disruption to the Company's operations, divert management attention, and lead to short-term decision-making that may not align with the Company's long-term strategic goals. In particular, activist investors may advocate for a breakup of the Company through spin-offs, divestitures, or other structural changes. While such proposals may be positioned as enhancing shareholder value, there is no assurance that any resulting transactions would be successful or in the best interests of all shareholders. A breakup could result in: Loss of operational synergies and scale efficiencies; Increased costs associated with separation, including legal, tax, and restructuring expenses; Reduced strategic flexibility and competitive positioning; Potential adverse impacts on employee morale, retention, and recruitment; Market uncertainty and volatility in the Company's stock price. Moreover, if a breakup is pursued under pressure rather than through a deliberate strategic process, it may lead to suboptimal outcomes, including undervaluation of assets or businesses, weakened financial performance, and diminished shareholder returns. These risks could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nThe market price forthe Company's common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant volatility in the future. This volatility may impair the ability to finance strategic transactions with the Company's stock and otherwise harm the Company's business. The Company's stock price has experienced significant price and volume volatility for the past several years, and the Company's stock price is likely to experience significant volatility in the future. The trading price of the Company's common stock may be influenced by factors beyond the Company's control, such as the volatility of the financial markets, uncertainty surrounding domestic and foreign economies, conditions and trends in the markets the Company serves, changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of the Company's markets, publication of research reports, and recommendations by financial analysts relating to the Company's business, the business of competitors, or the industries in which the Company operates and compete, changes in market valuation or earnings of competitors, legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions, sales of the Company's common stock by principal shareholders, actions or other announcements by activist shareholders regarding the Company's business or the trading price of the Company's common stock, and the trading volume of the Company's common stock. The historical market prices of the Company's common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and the Company may be unable to sustain or increase the value of the Company's common stock. The Company has historically used equity incentive compensation as part of the Company's overall compensation arrangements. The effectiveness of equity incentive compensation in retaining key employees may be adversely impacted by volatility in the Company's stock price. Significant declines in the Company's stock price may also interfere with the ability, if needed, to raise additional funds through equity financing or to finance strategic transactions with the Company's stock. In addition, there may be increased risk of securities litigation following periods of fluctuations in the Company's stock price. Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. These and other consequences of volatility in the Company's stock price which could be exacerbated by macroeconomic conditions that affect the market generally, or the Company's industries in particular, could have the effect of diverting management’s attention and could materially harm the Company's business.\n\nThe Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation grantsthe Company's board of directors the power to designate and issue additional shares of common and/or preferred stock. The Company's authorized capital consists of 70,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000 shares of preferred stock. In addition, there are authorized 30,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, none of which are outstanding and all of which have previously converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and may not be reissued. The Company's preferred stock may be designated into series pursuant to authority granted by the Company'sAmended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “ Articles of Incorporation”), and on approval fromthe Company's board of directors (the “ Board of Directors” or “ Board”). The Board of Directors, without any action by the Company's common shareholders, may designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock in such classes or series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of other classes or series of stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of the Company's common stock. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of the Company's common stock.\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nProvisions ofthe Company's charter documents or Pennsylvania law could discourage, delay or prevent the Company from being acquired even if being acquired would be beneficial to the Company's shareholders and could make it more difficult to change management. The Articles and the Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and to the rights of the Company’s shareholders. Certain of these provisions may have a potential “anti-takeover” effect by delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Pennsylvania law may have a similar effect. See “ Anti-takeover Effect of the Company’s Governing Documents and Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law” included in the Description of Securities filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of such provisions. Such provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, even if such transaction would be beneficial to most or all of the shareholders.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors:\n\nThe Company's business is affected by general economic conditions, and any economic decline or other circumstances that result in reductions in the Company's customers’ spending could negatively impact the Company's sales volume and revenues. Generally, changes in domestic and international economic conditions affect the industries in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate. These changes include changes in the rate of consumption or use of the Company's products due to economic downturns, volatility in currency exchange rates, and changes in raw material prices resulting from supply and/or demand conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk, as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone or cancel spending. Other factors that could influence customer spending include energy costs, conditions in the credit markets, consumer confidence, global pandemics, and other factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have an effect on demand for the Company's products and services and negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various risks related to the local and international nature ofthe Company's business, including domestic and foreign laws, regulations and standards. In recent years, there have been significant shifts in governments’ priorities with respect to enforcing such laws, regulations and standards. Notwithstanding such shifts, failure to comply with such laws and regulations or the occurrence of unforeseen developments such as litigation, investigations, governmental proceedings or enforcement actions could adversely affect the Company's business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, new executive orders have been announced, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. For example, since taking office, the current administration of the U. S. government has sought to adopt new regulations and policies and to suspend, revise or rescind prior policies that are identified as conflicting with the administration’s position, which has resulted in increased regulatory uncertainty. Any changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations could increase the Company's costs of doing business or impact the Company's operations. Failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards has in the past and may in the future result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to the Company's reputation. Furthermore, while the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that associates, contractors or agents will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or the Company's policies. Any failure to comply with or violation of the various laws, regulations and standards to which the Company is subject could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases. Labor is a significant component of the Company's operations. Several factors may adversely affect the labor force available to Matthews or increase labor costs (i. e., labor rates and overtime levels), including high employment levels, unemployment subsidies, increased wages offered by other employers, vaccine mandates and other government regulations and the Company’s responses thereto. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, or labor inflation, caused by pandemics or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and operating results.\n\nThe Company relies on information technology to operate the Company's business. Security breach incidents and breakdowns of information technologies, or failure to comply with laws governing data privacy and data protection, could disrupt the Company's operations, subject the Company to legal claims, and impact the Company's financial results. In the course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data and proprietary business information. The Company could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of the Company's network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although the Company is not aware of\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, (continued)\n\nany significant incidents to date, if it is unable to prevent, detect and timely remediate such security or privacy breaches, its operations could be disrupted or the Company may suffer legal claims, reputational damage, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. The Company expects that compliance with laws governing data privacy and data protection will require ongoing investment in systems, policies and personnel and will continue to impact Matthews’ business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. There can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by governmental and regulatory agencies, including data protection authorities, with respect to standards that may be adopted in the future. If the Company is found or suspected to have violated data privacy or data protection laws, it may be subject to potential private consumer, business partner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, governmental investigations and proceedings, and may incur damage to its reputation. Any such developments may subject Matthews to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.\n\nIf the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, the Company may not be able to accurately report the Company's financial results, and may require the restatement of previously published financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, investor confidence in the Company's business and the trading price of the Company's securities. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a comprehensive evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, the Company is required to document and test its internal control over financial reporting, management is required to assess and issue a report concerning internal control over financial reporting, and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls could cause the Company to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in the consolidated financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If the Company cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock could decline significantly, and its business, financial condition, and reputation could be harmed.\n\nThe Company's efforts to comply with Dodd-Frank and other evolving laws and regulations could result in increased costs and expenses related to compliance and potential violations. The Company is required to comply with various securities laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\"). Dodd-Frank contains provisions, among others, designed to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply chains of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefiting armed groups (\"Conflict Minerals\"). While Dodd-Frank does not prohibit companies from using Conflict Minerals, the SEC mandates due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for companies for which Conflict Minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product. The Company's efforts to comply with Dodd-Frank and other evolving laws, regulations and standards could result in increased costs and expenses related to compliance and potential violations.\n\nITEM 1B.
