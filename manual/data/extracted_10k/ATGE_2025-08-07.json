      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\nOverview\n\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Adtalem Global Education Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to as “Adtalem,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or similar references. Adtalem was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1987. Our executive offices are located at 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, 60606, and the telephone number is (312) 651-1400.\n\nAdtalem is the leading healthcare educator in the U.S. and a systemically important solution for preparing a diverse talent workforce that meets the needs of the healthcare industry. The purpose of Adtalem is to empower students to achieve their goals, find success, and make inspiring contributions to our global community.\n\nAdtalem is comprised of five like-kind institutions, with programs focusing on healthcare, including nursing, social and behavioral sciences, medicine, veterinary medicine, and more. Adtalem operates Chamberlain University (“Chamberlain”), Walden University (“Walden”), American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (“AUC”), Ross University School of Medicine (“RUSM”), and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (“RUSVM”), which comprises more than 90,000 students learning at multiple campuses and online. Adtalem’s institutions have an alumni community of approximately 350,000.\n\nAdtalem is a mission driven organization, committed to delivering highly qualified healthcare clinicians to urban and rural communities as a scaled provider of workers to the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nAdtalem remains focused on expanding access to aspiring students through a seamless student experience, leveraging innovative learning technologies, bringing new programs to market, and utilizing our Growth with Purpose operating model to provide the infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of where, when, and how students learn best.\n\nAdtalem aims to create value for society and its stakeholders by offering responsive educational programs that are supported by exceptional services to its students and delivered with integrity and accountability. Towards this vision, Adtalem is proud to play a vital role in expanding access to higher education.\n\nSegments Overview\n\nWe present three reportable segments as follows:\n\nChamberlain – This segment includes the operations of Chamberlain, which offers degree and certificate programs in the nursing and health professions postsecondary education industry.\n\nWalden – This segment includes the operations of Walden, which offers degree and certificate programs, including those in nursing, education, counseling, business, information technology, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice.\n\nMedical and Veterinary – This segment includes the operations of AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM, collectively referred to as the “medical and veterinary schools,” which offers degree and certificate programs in the medical and veterinary postsecondary education industry.\n\nChamberlain\n\nChamberlain was founded in 1889 as Deaconess College of Nursing and acquired by Adtalem in 2005. In May 2017, Chamberlain College of Nursing broadened its reach in healthcare education through the establishment of Chamberlain University and now offers its programs through its College of Nursing and College of Health Professions.\n\nChamberlain’s nursing degree offerings include a three-year onsite and online pre-licensure Bachelor of Science in Nursing (“BSN”) degree, an online post-licensure BSN degree completion option for Registered Nurses (“RN-BSN”), an online Master of Science in Nursing (“MSN”) degree, including Nurse Practitioner tracks and other specialties, and the online Doctor of Nursing Practice (“DNP”) degree.\n\nThrough its College of Health Professions, Chamberlain offers an online Master of Public Health (“MPH”) degree program, an online Master of Social Work (“MSW”) degree program, and an onsite Master of Physician Assistant Studies (“MPAS”) degree program.\n\nChamberlain provides an educational experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, and integrity delivered through its 23 campuses and online. Chamberlain is committed to graduating health professionals who are empowered to transform healthcare delivery.\n\nChamberlain’s pre-licensure BSN program enables students to complete their degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to the typical four-year BSN program with summer breaks. Beginning in September 2019, Chamberlain began offering an evening/weekend BSN option at select campuses. In September 2020, Chamberlain launched its online BSN option that offers a blend of flexibility, interactivity, and experiential learning.\n\n Students who already have passed their National Council Licensure Examination (“NCLEX”) exam and achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain’s RN-BSN completion option in three semesters of full-time study, although most students enroll part-time while they continue working as nurses.\n\nThe online MSN degree program offers five non-direct-care specialty tracks: Nurse Educator, Nurse Executive, Nursing Informatics, Population Health, and Healthcare Policy. The accelerated MSN program offers a Clinical Nurse Leadership concentration. The accelerated RN-MSN program offers associate or diploma-prepared RNs an opportunity to earn an MSN versus a BSN with the option of completing the Advanced Generalist concentration in one year of full-time study and the Clinical Nurse Leadership concentration in one and a half years of full-time study.\n\nChamberlain also offers four direct-care nurse practitioner tracks: Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”), Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGACNP”), Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGPCNP”), and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (“PMHNP”). The FNP, AGACNP, AGPCNP, and PMHNP, programs are designed to be completed in two and a half years of part-time study.\n\nThe online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”). The program can be completed in five to six semesters of study.\n\nChamberlain’s College of Health Professions MPH degree program focuses on preparing students through interdisciplinary coursework to become public health practitioners serving communities and populations to promote healthy communities and to work to address health problems and health-related issues such as disease, poverty, and violence. The MSW degree program prepares students for generalist or specialized practice and offers three tracks, including Crisis and Response Interventions, Trauma, and Medical Social Work. The program offers both a traditional and advanced standing option. The advanced standing option is for students who have completed a baccalaureate degree in social work. The MPAS degree program prepares students for the practice of general medicine as Physician Assistants in collaboration with a licensed physician and healthcare team and is designed to be completed in two years.\n\nStudent Admissions and Admissions Standards\n\nPre-Licensure BSN Program\n\nThe Chamberlain undergraduate pre-licensure admission process comprises two phases: Academic Eligibility and Clinical Clearance. Applicants must complete both to be eligible for admission. Determining Academic Eligibility is the role of the Chamberlain BSN Unified Admission Committee. The committee reviews applicants using a weighted evaluation system that considers several factors which may include previous coursework, grade point average, ACT/SAT scores and Health Education Systems, Inc. (“HESI”) Admission Assessment (A2) scores. All applicants deemed academically eligible by the committee must then initiate the Clinical Clearance phase which includes drug, background, and fingerprint screenings, and clear all screenings within 120 days of the session start date. Applicants who enroll in the original session applied for may be granted full acceptance by signing a self-attestation and disclosure indicating their ability to clear all screenings within 120 days of the session start date. Chamberlain enrolls students in its pre-licensure program at least three times per year, during the January, May, and September sessions and select campuses may offer additional opportunities to start.\n\nRN-BSN Option\n\nAdmission to the RN-BSN option requires a nursing diploma or Associate Degree in Nursing from an accredited institution, a minimum grade point average of 2.0, and a current, active, unrestricted RN license in the U.S. or other jurisdiction that is an associate member of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (“NCSBN”). Chamberlain enrolls students in its RN-BSN program six times per year, during the January, March, May, July, September, and November sessions.\n\nGraduate Programs\n\nTo enroll in graduate programs, students must have the requisite undergraduate academic degree from an accredited institution and a specified minimum grade point average. Applicants to some programs are also required to provide additional materials and information such as recommendation letters or background checks and/or interview with and be approved by faculty.\n\nChamberlain enrolls students in its graduate nursing, MPH, and MSW programs six times per year, during the January, March, May, July, September, and November sessions. Chamberlain enrolls students in its graduate MPAS program once a year in the September session.\n\nWalden\n\nFor more than 50 years, Walden has provided an engaging learning experience for working professionals. Walden seeks to empower students to use their new knowledge to think creatively about problem-solving to improve society.\n\nFounded in 1970 and first accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”) in 1990, Walden has a strong legacy of providing innovative and alternative degree programs for adult students. Walden has grown to support more than 100 degree and certificate programs—including programs at the bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels—with over 350 specializations and concentrations.\n\n3\n\n\nIn addition, Walden has rich experience in delivering innovative accelerated programs through distance delivery. Walden also has experience in delivering accelerated course-based programs where students can customize modalities to speed their time to completion and degree completion programs (for example, the RN-BSN). Walden currently offers more than 25 programs/specializations and one certificate in a direct assessment competency-based education format through its Tempo Learning® modality. Through a culture of assessment and continuous improvement, Walden has developed the organization and resources required to deliver a quality academic learning experience to working adults via distance delivery. All Walden academic programs are delivered in an online format.\n\nWalden’s colleges and programs are structured within two main divisions – the Division of Health Care Access and Quality and the Division of Social Support for Healthy Communities. \n\nWalden believes this organizational structure supports its mission via a focused effort promoting healthy communities and healthy people, as identified through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s national effort in this area known as Healthy People 2030. \n\nStudent Admissions and Admissions Standards\n\nWalden has a long-standing commitment to providing educational opportunities to learners across all degree levels. Walden’s programs are enriched by the cultural, economic, and educational backgrounds of its students and instructors. In the admissions process, Walden selects individuals who can benefit from a distributed educational or online learning approach and who will use their Walden education to contribute to their academic or professional communities.\n\nFor admissions review to take place, applicants must submit an online application for their intended program of study and an official transcript with a qualifying admitting degree from a U.S. school accredited by a regional, professional/specialized, or national accrediting organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or the U.S. Department of Education (“ED”), or from an appropriately accredited non-U.S. institution. Additional materials or requirements to submit may vary depending on the academic program.\n\nAll applicants to the bachelor’s program are required to have earned, at a minimum, a recognized high school diploma, high school equivalency certificate, or other state-recognized credential of high school completion. Applicants with degrees and coursework from a non-U.S. institution have their academic record evaluated for comparability to a U.S. degree or coursework by our Global Transcript Evaluation (“GTE”) service offered by Walden or any credential evaluation service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (“NACES”) or member of Association of International Credential Evaluators (“AICE”).\n\nApplicants may be offered conditional admission to Walden with a stipulation for academic performance at the level of a grade point average of 3.0 or higher for master’s and doctoral students or a grade point average of 2.0 or higher for undergraduate students, the successful completion of academic progress requirements during the initial term(s) of enrollment, the completion of prerequisites, and/or other stipulations (including receipt of official records).\n\nMedical and Veterinary\n\nAUC and RUSM\n\nAUC, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2011, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is located in St. Maarten and has graduated over 7,500 physicians since inception. The mission of AUC is to train tomorrow’s physicians, whose service to their communities and their patients is enhanced by international learning experiences and an emphasis on social accountability and engagement. \n\nRUSM, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. RUSM is located in Barbados and has graduated over 15,000 physicians since inception. The mission of RUSM is to deliver an innovative and experiential medical education program in an inclusive environment of scholars that fosters professional growth and leadership and trains students to become ethical, compassionate, and patient-centric physicians who advance healthcare in local and global communities.\n\n4\n\n\nAUC’s and RUSM’s programs consist of three academic semesters per year, which begin in January, May, and September, allowing students to begin their basic science instruction at the most convenient time for them.\n\nInitially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences after which eligible students sit for U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (“USMLE”), Step 1, which assesses whether students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine. Under AUC and RUSM direction, students then complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations conducted at over 40 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers connected with accredited graduate medical education programs in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Towards the end of the clinical training and prior to graduation, AUC and RUSM students take USMLE, Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge), which assesses ability to apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. AUC and RUSM students use the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (“ECFMG”) pathways to enter the U.S. residency match.\n\nUpon successful completion of their medical degree requirements, students apply for a residency position in their area of specialty through the National Residency Matching Program (“NRMP”). This process is also known as “The Match”® and utilizes an algorithm to “match” applicants to programs using the certified rank order lists of the applicants and program directors.\n\nOf first-time eligible AUC graduates, 98% and 95% attained residency positions in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nOf first-time eligible RUSM graduates, 98% and 96% attained residency positions in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nIn September 2019, AUC opened its medical education program in the U.K. in partnership with University of Central Lancashire (“UCLAN”). The program offers students a Post Graduate Diploma in International Medical Sciences from UCLAN, followed by their Doctor of Medicine degree from AUC. Students are eligible to do clinical rotations at AUC’s clinical sites, which include hospitals in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. This program is aimed at preparing students for USMLEs.\n\nMedical Education Readiness Program (“MERP”) is a 15-week medical school preparatory program focused on enhancing the academic foundation of prospective AUC and RUSM students and providing them with the skills they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians. Upon successful completion of the MERP program, students are guaranteed admission to AUC or RUSM.\n\nRUSVM\n\nRUSVM, founded in 1982 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides veterinary education and confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, as well as Masters of Science and Ph.D. degrees. RUSVM is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (“AVMA”). RUSVM is located in St. Kitts and has graduated nearly 6,000 veterinarians since inception. The mission of RUSVM is to provide the best learning environment to prepare students to become members and leaders of the worldwide public and professional healthcare team, advancing human and animal health­–One Health–through research and knowledge exchange.\n\nThe RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester, pre-clinical curriculum at the campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship under RUSVM direction lasting approximately 45 weeks at clinical affiliates located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K.\n\nRUSVM offers a one-semester Vet Prep Program designed to enhance the pre-clinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school.\n\nStudent Admissions and Admissions Standards\n\nAUC, RUSM, and RUSVM employ regional admissions representatives in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada who provide information to students interested in their respective programs. A successful applicant must have completed the required prerequisite courses and, for AUC and RUSM U.S. students, taken the Medical College Admission Test \n\n5\n\n\n(“MCAT”), while RUSVM applicants are strongly encouraged but not required to have completed the Graduate Record Exam (“GRE”). Candidates for admission must interview with an admissions representative and all admission decisions are made by the admissions committees of the medical and veterinary schools. AUC allows several entrance examinations for its international students.\n\nMarket Trends and Competition\n\nChamberlain\n\nChamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 2,000 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and less-than-2-year schools. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education.\n\nIn the pre-licensure nursing market, capacity limitations and restricted new student enrollment are common among traditional four-year educational institutions and community colleges. Chamberlain has 23 campuses located in 15 states and an online BSN program offered in 36 states. In Fall 2024, according to data obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”), Chamberlain had the largest pre-licensure program in the U.S. based on total enrollments.\n\nIn post-licensure nursing education, there are more than 700 institutions offering RN-BSN programs and more than 600 institutions offering MSN programs. Chamberlain’s RN-BSN degree completion option has received three certifications from Quality Matters, an independent global organization leading quality assurance in online teaching and learning environments. Chamberlain has earned the Online Learning Support, Online Teaching Support, and Online Learner Success certifications.\n\nIn Fall 2024, according to AACN data, Chamberlain had the largest BSN, MSN, FNP, and DNP programs in the U.S based on total enrollments.\n\nWalden\n\nThe market for fully online higher education, in which Walden competes, remains a competitive and growing space. As a comprehensive university offering degrees at the bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral level, in addition to certificates and a school of lifelong learning, the competition varies depending on the degree level and the discipline. While Walden’s target market of working professionals 25 years and older was once underserved, it now has a variety of options to meet the growing need for higher education.\n\n Walden has degree programs in nursing, education, counseling, business, information technology, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice. Walden competes both with other comprehensive universities and also more narrowly focused schools, which may only offer a few degree programs. Given the growing and ever-changing market, Walden competes with a wide variety of higher education institutions as well as other education providers.\n\n Walden competes with traditional public and private non-profit institutions and for-profit schools. As more campus-based institutions offer online programs, the competition for online higher education has been growing. Typically, public universities charge lower tuition compared with Walden due to state subsidies, government grants, and access to other financial resources. On the other hand, tuition at private non-profit institutions is higher than the average tuition rates at Walden. Walden competes with other educational institutions principally based on price, quality of education, reputation, learning modality, educational programs, and student services. \n\nWalden has over 50 years of experience offering high quality distance education. Walden remains a leader in many areas and is one of the leading doctoral degree conferrers in nursing, public health, public policy, business/management, education, and psychology and one of the leading conferrers of master’s degrees in nursing, psychology, social work, human services, education, and counseling.\n\n6\n\n\nMedical and Veterinary\n\nAUC and RUSM compete with U.S. schools of medicine, U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, and Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from ED Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with U.S.-based and international AVMA accredited schools.\n\nThere has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors and veterinarians. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical and veterinary education.\n\nAccreditation and Other Regulatory Approvals\n\nEducational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance and institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied.\n\nChamberlain\n\nChamberlain is institutionally accredited by the HLC, an institutional accreditation agency recognized by ED. In addition to institutional accreditation, Chamberlain has also obtained programmatic accreditation for specific programs. BSN, MSN, DNP, and post-graduate Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (“APRN”) certificate programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (“CCNE”). Chamberlain’s MPH program is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (“CEPH”). Chamberlain’s MSW program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (“CSWE”)’s Commission on Accreditation. The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (“ARC-PA”) has granted Accreditation-Provisional status to the MPAS program. Accreditation-Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s ability to meet the ARC-PA Standards or when a program holding Accreditation-Provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students. Accreditation-Provisional does not ensure any subsequent accreditation status. It is limited to no more than five years from matriculation of the first class. Additionally, Chamberlain is an accredited provider of nursing continuing professional development credits by the American Nurses Credentialing Center.\n\nWalden\n\nWalden is also institutionally accredited by the HLC. In addition to its institutional accreditation, a number of Walden’s programs have obtained programmatic accreditation. The BS in Information Technology program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. A number of business programs (BS in Business Administration, Master of Business Administration, MS in Finance, Doctor of Business Administration, and Ph.D. in Management) are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (“ACBSP”). The BS and MS in Accounting programs are accredited by ACBSP’s Separate Accounting Accreditation. The BSN, MSN, Post-Master’s APRN certificates, and DNP programs are accredited by CCNE. The MS in Addiction Counseling, MS in School Counseling, MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, MS in Marriage, Couple, and Family Counseling, and Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision programs are accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs. Walden’s initial teacher preparation programs, BS in Elementary Education and Master of Arts in Teaching with a specialization in Special Education, and advanced educator preparation programs, education specialist in Educational Leadership and Administration and MS in Education with a specialization in Educational Leadership and Administration, in the Richard W. Riley College of Education and Human Sciences are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation. The MPH and Doctor of Public Health programs are accredited by the CEPH. The Bachelor of Social Work and MSW programs are accredited by the CSWE. Additionally, Walden is an accredited provider of continuing education credits by the American Nurses Credentialing Center.\n\n7\n\n\nMedical and Veterinary\n\nThe Government of St. Maarten authorizes AUC to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is accredited by the Accreditation Commission on Colleges of Medicine (“ACCM”). The ACCM is an international medical school accrediting organization for countries that do not have a national medical school accreditation body. The U.S. Department of Education National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (“NCFMEA”) has affirmed that the ACCM has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the U.S. Liaison Committee on Medical Education (“LCME”). In addition, AUC is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and approve an international medical school’s programs. AUC students can join residency training programs in all 50 states. AUC has also been deemed acceptable by the Graduate Medical Council (“GMC”), the accrediting body in the U.K., which allows AUC graduates to apply for residency programs in the U.K.\n\nThe Government of Barbados authorizes RUSM to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree through a registration process with the Barbados Accreditation Council. RUSM’s primary accreditor is Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (“CAAM-HP”). CAAM-HP is authorized to accredit medical programs by the government of Barbados. On July 26, 2018, Barbados authorized RUSM to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. The NCFMEA has affirmed that CAAM-HP has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the LCME. In addition, RUSM is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and accredit an international medical school’s programs. RUSM students can join residency training programs in all 50 states.\n\nRUSVM has been recognized by the government of the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis (“St. Kitts”) and is chartered to confer the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. The Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (“AVMA COE”). RUSVM has affiliations with many AVMA-accredited U.S. and international colleges of veterinary medicine so that RUSVM students can complete their final three clinical semesters of study in the U.S. or abroad. RUSVM has received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board. The Postgraduate Studies program offers MS and Ph.D. degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM's themed research centers.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nLike other higher education institutions, Adtalem’s institutions are dependent upon the timely receipt of federal financial aid funds. All public financial aid programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. Adtalem’s institutions and their students participate in a wide range of financial aid programs, including U.S. federal financial aid, state financial aid, Canadian financial aid, private loan programs, tax-favored programs, Adtalem-provided financial assistance, and employer-provided financial assistance. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the “HEA”) guides the federal government’s support of postsecondary education. Changes to financial aid programs that restrict student eligibility or reduce funding levels could have a material adverse effect on Adtalem’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of student financial aid related risks.\n\nLegislative and Regulatory Requirements\n\nGovernment-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem’s institutions’ administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding.\n\nOur domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following: (1) the federal government through ED, (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by ED, and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies. Therefore, to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an agency recognized by ED, must \n\n8\n\n\ncomply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate higher education authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.\n\nIn addition to governance by the regulatory triad, members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), review the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect that this regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nChanges in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility or cost to participate in Title IV programs, to meet accreditation standards or comply with state authorization requirements. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV participating institutions (“Title IV institutions”) is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement (“PPA”) as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem’s other Title IV institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem’s other Title IV institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see “A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\n\nFinancial Responsibility\n\nInstitutions must pass an ED financial responsibility test, also known as a “composite score,” to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV aid programs. For Adtalem’s institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. Applying various financial elements from annual audited financial statements, the score is a composite of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution’s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution’s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution’s ability to operate profitably. A score greater than or equal to 1.5 indicates the institution is considered financially responsible. A score less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 is considered financially responsible but requires additional oversight. For example, an institution with a score in this range is subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is not considered financially responsible but may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).\n\nPrior to fiscal year 2022, Adtalem’s composite score was greater than 1.5. However, on September 25, 2023, ED notified Adtalem that its fiscal year 2022 composite score had declined to 0.2. As previously disclosed, this was expected due to the acquisition of Walden and other transactions. ED advised that Adtalem’s five institutions will be permitted to continue to participate in Title IV under provisional certifications with heightened cash monitoring and continued reporting. Management does not believe these conditions will have a material adverse effect on Adtalem’s operations. At ED’s request, Adtalem maintains two surety-backed letters of credit totaling $179.0 million representing 10% of the consolidated Title IV funds Adtalem’s institutions received during fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe financial responsibility rules include other mandatory or discretionary triggers that could require an institution to post a letter of credit. ED recently amended the financial responsibility regulation and the changes took effect July 1, 2024. The changes include additional triggers which could require additional letters of credit.\n\nProgram Participation Agreement\n\nThe HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in Title IV programs must be certified to participate through a \n\n9\n\n\nPPA and certification must be periodically renewed. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution’s PPA. In addition, ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution, or make any other significant change. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. Provisional certification status also carries fewer due process protections than full certification. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its PPA, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action.\n\nChamberlain was most recently recertified and issued an unrestricted PPA in September 2020, with a reapplication date of June 30, 2024. The lengthy PPA recertification process is such that ED allows unhampered continued access to Title IV funding after PPA expiration, so long as materially complete applications are submitted at least 90 days in advance of expiration. A complete application for Chamberlain’s PPA recertification has been timely submitted to ED.\n\nED approved Walden’s change in ownership application and issued Walden a provisional PPA through June 30, 2025, with its application for PPA recertification due March 31, 2025. A complete application for Walden’s PPA recertification has been timely submitted to ED.\n\nED provisionally recertified AUC and RUSM’s Title IV PPAs through March 31, 2025. Complete applications for AUC and RUSM’s PPA recertification have been timely submitted to ED. ED has provisionally recertified RUSVM’s Title IV PPA through March 31, 2027. \n\nThe provisional nature of the PPAs stemmed from Adtalem’s composite score declining and failing to meet ED’s standards of financial responsibility as described above.\n\nWalden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM’s provisional PPAs included financial requirements, such as letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring, and additional reporting. We do not believe these requirements will have a material effect on Adtalem’s financial position or results of operations. With the approval of its change in ownership, Walden has the ability to request ED approval for new programs.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, Adtalem had $179.0 million of letters of credit outstanding in favor of ED. See “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” in Note 13 “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.\n\nGainful Employment\n\nThe HEA requires certificate programs at all Title IV institutions and degree programs at proprietary Title IV institutions to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. In October 2023, ED released new Financial Value Transparency (“FVT”) and Gainful Employment (“GE”) rules effective July 1, 2024. GE programs must meet a debt-to-earnings test in which graduates’ annual debt payments must not exceed 8% of their annual earnings or 20% of their discretionary earnings. GE programs must also meet an earnings premium test in which graduates’ earnings must exceed those of a typical high school graduate. Under the regulation, programs that fail either metric must provide warnings to students and prospective students that the program is at risk of losing Title IV eligibility and programs that fail the same measure in two out of three consecutive years lose Title IV eligibility. The GE regulation also includes a transparency framework in which debt-to-earnings, earnings premium, and a wide range of other program outcomes for all Title IV programs are disclosed on a website hosted by ED. Because there are many factors and unknowns, including the earnings of program graduates, Adtalem is reviewing the regulation to determine what impact, if any, the regulation will have on its programs. In addition, multiple parties are seeking to block enforcement of the FVT/GE rule under the Administrative Procedure Act and other legal theories. On February 14, 2025, ED extended the institutional reporting deadline until \n\n10\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2025. On July 25, 2025, ED announced its intent to establish negotiated rulemaking committees in advance of issuing draft regulations on various topics, including Financial Value Transparency and Gainful Employment.\n\nDo No Harm\n\nThe recently enacted Do No Harm provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) provide that an undergraduate program may lose Title IV eligibility if the earnings of a programmatic cohort of its completers as defined in OBBBA are no greater than earnings of a population with a high school diploma, and a graduate program may lose Title IV eligibility if the earnings of a programmatic cohort of its completers as defined in OBBBA are no greater than the earnings of a population with a bachelor’s degree, in each case for two years in a three-year period. These provisions are applicable to all Title IV participating institutions. Regulations to define how Do No Harm will be implemented, including the definition of completer, the populations to be used to measure the difference between earnings of completers and earnings of others, have yet to be promulgated. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of Do No Harm related risks.\n\nThe 90/10 Rule\n\nAn ED regulation known as the 90/10 Rule affects only proprietary institutions participating in Title IV programs, including each of Adtalem’s institutions. An institution that does not meet the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Previously, an institution could not derive more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV financial aid funds. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act amended the 90/10 calculation to require no more than 90% of revenue at proprietary institutions be derived from any federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and Department of Defense tuition assistance funds. This change was subject to negotiated rulemaking with the final rule published by ED in October 2022. The amended rule applies to an institution’s fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For Adtalem’s institutions, the updated 90/10 rule is therefore effective with the calculation for fiscal year 2024. The following table shows the 90/10 rates for each Adtalem institution for fiscal year 2024 based on the new 90/10 rules and fiscal year 2023 based on the old 90/10 rules that were still in effect for that period. We are also providing a consolidated rate for Adtalem even though it is not subject to 90/10 requirements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFiscal Year\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2024\n\n​\n\n2023\n\nChamberlain University\n\n 68\n\n%\n\n 65\n\n%\n\nWalden University\n\n​\n\n 82\n\n%\n\n 78\n\n%\n\nAmerican University of the Caribbean School of Medicine\n\n 87\n\n%\n\n 81\n\n%\n\nRoss University School of Medicine\n\n 87\n\n%\n\n 87\n\n%\n\nRoss University School of Veterinary Medicine\n\n 78\n\n%\n\n 79\n\n%\n\nConsolidated\n\n 77\n\n%\n\n 75\n\n%\n\nBorrower Defense to Repayment\n\nUnder the HEA, ED is authorized to specify acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a Defense to Repayment of their Title IV loans made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. New Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations were scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2023 that include a lower threshold for establishing misrepresentation, no statute of limitation for claims submission, expanded reasons to file a claim including aggressive or deceptive recruitment tactics and omission of fact, weakened due processes afforded to institutions, and reinstated provisions for group discharges. ED also included a six-year statute of limitations for recovery of funds from institutions. These changes would increase financial liability risk and reputational risk for Adtalem. However, the updated rules have not yet been implemented due to pending litigation from another party based on the Administrative Procedure Act and other legal theories.\n\nIncentive Compensation\n\nAn educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations \n\n11\n\n\ngoverning this requirement have not established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, which increased the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation.\n\nAdministrative Capability\n\nThe HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny, provisional certification, or revocation of eligibility for Title IV programs. ED recently amended the administrative capability regulations and the changes took effect July 1, 2024. The changes include additional tests of administrative capability that Adtalem’s institutions must meet. Management does not expect that Adtalem’s institutions will fail to meet these requirements.\n\nState Authorization\n\nInstitutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence.\n\nIn the U.S., each Chamberlain location is approved to grant degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Chamberlain has obtained licensure in each state which requires such licensure and where students are enrolled. Walden is registered in its home state of Minnesota with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education. Walden maintains licenses or exemptions in each state which requires such licensure and where students are enrolled. AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required.\n\nMany states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted $67.3 million of surety bonds as of June 30, 2025 with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM.\n\nCertain states have standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. When an Adtalem institution is unable to meet those state’s requirements, it may be required to cease operations in that state.\n\nCohort Default Rate (“CDR”)\n\nAll institutions that participate in Title IV programs must meet a CDR test for former students who entered repayment on Title IV loans received while enrolled at the institution. The rate represents the percentage of students defaulting on one or more Title IV loans within three years of entering repayment during a federal fiscal year. Institutions may lose Title IV eligibility if the most recent CDR exceeds 40% or if each of the three most recent CDRs exceed 30%.\n\nThe three-year CDRs for Adtalem’s institutions are shown below for the three most recent cohort years. According to ED, the default rate for all Title IV institutions nationally was 0.0% for the fiscal year 2021 cohort, 0.0% for the fiscal year 2020 cohort, and 2.3% for the fiscal year 2019 cohort. The default rate has been declining over the past few years due to COVID-19 relief measures which included a freeze on loan payments and suspension of default statuses.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCohort Default Rate\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2021\n\n​\n\n2020\n\n​\n\n2019\n\nChamberlain University\n\n​\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.5\n\n%\n\nWalden University\n\n​\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 1.1\n\n%\n\nAmerican University of the Caribbean School of Medicine\n\n​\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.2\n\n%\n\nRoss University School of Medicine\n\n​\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.2\n\n%\n\nRoss University School of Veterinary Medicine\n\n​\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.0\n\n%\n\n 0.2\n\n%\n\nSatisfactory Academic Progress\n\nIn addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.\n\n12\n\n\nChange of Ownership or Control\n\nAny material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution’s accreditors, reauthorization by each institution’s state licensing agencies, and/or providing financial protections. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained. After a material change in ownership or change of control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years.\n\nIn addition, each Title IV institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution’s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, and that evaluation may include a comprehensive review.\n\nIn addition, some states in which our Title IV institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, prior approval) of changes of ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change of ownership or control.\n\nRefer to the risk factor titled “If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditation and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\n\nSeasonality\n\nThe seasonal pattern of Adtalem’s enrollments and its educational programs’ starting dates affect the timing of cash flows with higher cash inflows at the beginning of academic sessions.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAt Adtalem, our people are the engine behind our mission: expanding access to healthcare education and career opportunity. Our strategy relies on a high-performing, purpose-driven workforce equipped to meet the evolving needs of our students, partners, and society.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, Adtalem had the following number of employees:\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFull-Time\n\n​\n\nPart-Time\n\n​\n\nTemporary\n\n​\n\nVisiting\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nStaff\n\n​\n\nStaff\n\n​\n\nStaff\n\n​\n\nProfessors\n\n​\n\nTotal\n\nChamberlain\n\n​\n\n 1,393\n\n​\n\n 16\n\n​\n\n 182\n\n​\n\n 2,861\n\n​\n\n 4,452\n\nWalden\n\n​\n\n 1,298\n\n​\n\n 12\n\n​\n\n 2\n\n​\n\n 2,412\n\n​\n\n 3,724\n\nMedical and Veterinary\n\n​\n\n 765\n\n​\n\n 14\n\n​\n\n 51\n\n​\n\n 102\n\n​\n\n 932\n\nHome Office\n\n​\n\n 1,247\n\n​\n\n 5\n\n​\n\n 11\n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 1,263\n\nTotal\n\n​\n\n 4,703\n\n​\n\n 47\n\n​\n\n 246\n\n​\n\n 5,375\n\n​\n\n 10,371\n\nAdtalem maintains positive employee relations and is not subject to any collective bargaining agreements.\n\nTalent Strategy: Enabling Growth Through People\n\nIn fiscal year 2025, Adtalem implemented a refreshed talent agenda aligned to being the leading healthcare educator in the U.S. and a systemically important solution to the healthcare industry–educating and supplying critical talent.\n\n13\n\n\nOur talent strategy prioritizes building a resilient leadership pipeline, expanding capabilities and upskilling, and embedding a culture that connects individual performance to enterprise-wide goals and financial rewards. Our strategic focus is rooted in four pillars:\n\n●Hire better: Expand candidate pipelines and diversify recruitment strategies\n\n●Grow faster: Scale development, mentoring, and mobility pathways\n\n●Inspire deeply: Foster purpose, trust, and inclusion to build a culture colleagues want to belong to–anchored in clear expectations and shared accountability\n\n●Demand more: Cultivate new capabilities and embed continuous learning\n\nThese efforts are underpinned by our Culture Expectations–a shared framework focused on prioritizing student outcomes, connecting daily work to strategy, continuously improving performance, and owning outcomes.\n\nOrganizational Health and Performance Enablement\n\nAdtalem views organizational health as a leading indicator of long-term performance. In January 2024, we conducted an enterprise-wide Organizational Health Index (“OHI”) pulse survey, which assessed progress across nine outcome areas and ten management practices. 65% of regular colleagues participated, a 6% increase over the prior year. Key highlights included:\n\n●4-point increase in overall OHI score, which increased Adtalem’s standing relative to the global OHI benchmark by a full quartile (1)\n\n●From the 10 priority management practices for Adtalem, we saw:\n\no8-point increase in “customer focus,” moving to 2nd quartile against the global benchmark, reflecting our continued push for focus on student outcomes in our day-to-day work\n\no6-point increase in shared vision, moving to 2nd quartile against the global benchmark, reflecting our progress in cascading our enterprise strategy across all segments and functions\n\no5-point increase in operational management, moving to 2nd quartile against the global benchmark, reflecting our continued progress in driving operational rigor that supports growth and the scale of our portfolio\n\nThe next OHI pulse is planned for Fall 2025 and will inform continued enterprise and segment level action plans to engage and retain our talent.\n\n(1) The Organizational Health Index global benchmark is comprised of 2,600 companies across 100 countries with 8 million respondents.\n\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-being\n\nAdtalem offers a comprehensive and competitive total rewards package designed to attract, retain, and support top talent. Highlights include:\n\n●Generous paid time off, retirement savings plans with 401(k) match, and domestic partner benefits\n\n●Paid parental leave for all parents and adoption assistance\n\n●Enhanced mental health resources, including Headspace Care and an expanded Employee Assistance Program\n\n●Holistic well-being programs under our Live Well strategy–supporting physical, emotional, financial, and social health\n\nWe also invest in our employees’ educational aspirations through tuition assistance and reimbursement across accredited institutions. These benefits reflect our commitment to cultivating an engaged, high-performing workforce aligned to business outcomes.\n\n14\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nAdtalem owns and uses numerous trademarks and service marks, such as “Adtalem,” “American University of the Caribbean,” “Chamberlain College of Nursing,” “Ross University,” “Walden University,” and others.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nAdtalem’s business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are not entirely within our control. Investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision with respect to Adtalem’s common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, Adtalem’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and as a result, the price of Adtalem’s common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Management cannot predict all the possible risks and uncertainties that may arise. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Adtalem’s business include the following:\n\nRisks Related to Adtalem’s Regulated Industry\n\nWe are subject to regulatory audits, investigations, lawsuits, or other proceedings relating to compliance by the institutions in the Adtalem portfolio with numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions applicable to the postsecondary education industry.\n\nDue to the regulated nature of proprietary postsecondary institutions, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of non-compliance, and lawsuits by federal and state governmental agencies, regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, present and former students and employees, shareholders, and other third parties, any of whom may allege violations of any of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us. If the results of any such claims or actions are unfavorable to us or one or more of our institutions, we may be required to pay monetary judgments, fines, or penalties, be required to repay funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have restrictions placed on or terminate our schools’ or programs’ eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have limitations placed on or terminate our schools’ operations or ability to grant degrees and certificates, have our schools’ accreditations restricted or revoked, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its Program Participation Agreement (“PPA”) as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem’s other Title IV institutions.\n\nThe ongoing regulatory effort aimed at all Title IV participating institutions could be a catalyst for additional legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions, and claims.\n\nAt times, Title IV participating institutions, from all sectors, have experienced scrutiny from federal and state legislators, agencies, attorneys general, and other government officials. An adverse disposition of these existing inquiries, administrative actions, or claims, or the initiation of other inquiries, administrative actions, or claims, could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nAdverse publicity arising from investigations, claims, or actions brought against us or other proprietary higher education institutions may negatively affect our reputation, business, or stock price, or attract additional investigations, lawsuits, or regulatory action.\n\nAdverse publicity regarding any past, pending, or future investigations, claims, settlements, and/or actions against us or other proprietary postsecondary education institutions could negatively affect our reputation, student enrollment levels, revenue, profit, and/or the market price of our common stock. Unresolved investigations, claims, and actions, or adverse resolutions or settlements thereof, could also result in additional inquiries, administrative actions or lawsuits, increased scrutiny, the withholding of authorizations, and/or the imposition of other sanctions by state education and professional licensing authorities, taxing authorities, our accreditors and other regulatory agencies governing us, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties have initiated, and could initiate additional investigations, claims, or actions against us, which could require us to pay monetary damages, halt certain business practices, or receive other sanctions. The defense and resolution of these matters could require us to expend significant resources.\n\nDue to the regulatory and enforcement efforts at times directed at all Title IV participating institutions and adverse publicity arising from such efforts, we may face additional government and regulatory investigations and actions, lawsuits from private plaintiffs, and shareholder class actions and derivative claims. We may incur significant costs and other expenses in connection with our response to, and defense, resolution, or settlement of, investigations, claims, or actions, or group of related investigations, claims, or actions, which, individually or in the aggregate, could be outside the scope of, or in excess of, our existing insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As part of our resolution of any such matter, or group of related matters, we may be required to comply with certain forms of injunctive relief, including altering certain business practices, or pay substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and/or penalties. In addition, findings or claims or settlements thereof could serve as a basis for additional lawsuits or governmental inquiries or enforcement actions, including actions under ED’s Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations. Such actions, individually or combined with other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain, or renew licenses, approvals, or accreditation, and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV, Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us under Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nED has issued regulations setting forth new standards and procedures related to Borrower Defense to Repayment of Title IV loan obligations, and ED’s right of recoveries against institutions following a successful borrower defense and institutional financial responsibility. It is possible that a finding or allegation arising from current or future legal proceedings or governmental administrative actions may create significant liability under the proposed regulations.\n\nUnder the Higher Education Act (“HEA”), the U.S. Department of Education (“ED”) is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a Borrower Defense to Repayment of a Direct Loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. See “Borrower Defense to Repayment” in Item 1. “Business” for additional information.\n\nAlthough OBBBA blocked implementation of the 2023 Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations until 2035, the 2020 regulations have been restored and the outcome of any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority, facts asserted in pending or future lawsuits, and/or the outcome of any future governmental inquiry, lawsuit, or enforcement action (including matters described in Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) could serve as the basis for claims by students or ED under the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations, the posting of substantial letters of credit, or the termination of eligibility of our institutions to participate in the Title IV program based on ED’s institutional capability assessment, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nWhile we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all pending and future legal proceedings, we may settle certain matters. Moreover, regardless of the merits of our actions and defenses, if we are unable to resolve certain legal proceedings or regulatory actions, indirect consequences arising from unproven allegations or appealable regulatory findings may have adverse consequences to us.\n\nWe may settle certain matters due to uncertainty in potential outcome, for strategic reasons, as a part of a resolution of other matters, or in order to avoid potentially worse consequences in inherently uncertain judicial or administrative processes. The terms of any such settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, although inconsistent with its usual practices, ED and other regulatory and accrediting bodies have broad discretion to impose significant limitations on us and our business operations arising from acts it determines are in violation of their regulations or standards. As a result, foreseeable and unforeseeable consequences of prior and prospective adjudicated or settled legal proceedings and regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nWithin Title IV regulations, pending or future lawsuits, investigations, program reviews, and other events could each trigger, automatically or in some cases at ED’s discretion, the posting of letters of credit or other securities.\n\nED regulations could require Adtalem to post multiple and substantial letters of credit or other securities in connection with, among other things, certain pending and future claims, investigations, and program reviews, regardless of the merits of our actions or available defenses, or, potentially, the severity of any findings or facts stipulated. The aggregate amount of these letters of credit or other required security could materially and adversely limit our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and our ability to make capital expenditures and other investments aimed at growing and diversifying our operations, sustain and fund our operations, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Adtalem’s credit agreement allows Adtalem to post up to $500.0 million in letters of credit. In the event Adtalem is required to post letters of credit in excess of the $500.0 million limit, Adtalem would be required to seek an amendment to its credit agreement or seek an alternative means of providing security required by ED. Adtalem may not be able to obtain the excess letters of credit or security or may only be able to obtain such excess letters of credit or security at significant cost. \n\nWe are subject to risks relating to regulatory matters. If we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our operations, we could face fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal and state student financial aid for our students, loss of ability to enroll students in a state, and significant civil liability.\n\nAs a provider of higher education, we are subject to extensive regulation. These regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases and aspects of our U.S. postsecondary operations, including educational program offerings, facilities, civil rights, safety, public health, privacy, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, acquisitions or openings of new schools or programs, addition of new educational programs, and changes in our corporate structure and ownership.\n\nIn particular, the HEA subjects schools that participate in the various federal student financial aid programs under Title IV, which includes all Adtalem Title IV institutions, to significant regulatory scrutiny. Adtalem’s Title IV institutions collectively receive 77% of their revenue from Title IV programs. As a result, the suspension, limitation, or termination of the eligibility of any of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our \n\n17\n\n\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution, which ultimately is accomplished through the execution of a PPA.\n\nOur institutions that participate in Title IV programs each do so pursuant to a PPA that, among other things, includes commitments to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, such as Incentive Compensation and Substantial Misrepresentation. Alleged violations of such laws or regulations may form the basis of civil actions for violation of state and/or federal false claims statutes predicated on violations of a PPA, including pursuant to lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs on behalf of governments (qui tam actions), that have the potential to generate very significant damages linked to our receipt of Title IV funding from the government over a period of several years.\n\nGovernment budgetary pressures and changes to laws governing financial aid programs could reduce our student enrollment or delay our receipt of tuition payments.\n\nOur Title IV institutions collectively receive 77% of their revenue from Title IV programs. As a result, any reductions in funds available to our students or any delays in payments to us under Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for those programs could reduce Adtalem’s student enrollment and/or increase its costs of operation. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV programs. The U.S. Congress enacted the HEA to be reauthorized on a periodic basis, which most recently occurred in August 2008.\n\nA comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill has not yet been introduced. However, standalone bills impacting Title IV federal financial aid programs have been introduced in both chambers of Congress. Some of these bills could be included in a larger legislative package, which could include the HEA. When the HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.\n\nThe U.S. Congress can change the laws affecting Title IV programs in annual federal appropriations bills and other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations, as it did in the recent OBBBA, as discussed in detail in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n\nWe are currently analyzing the changes made by OBBBA and what effect they may have on Adtalem.\n\nAt this time, Adtalem cannot predict what additional changes the U.S. Congress may ultimately make. Since a significant percentage of Adtalem’s revenue is tied to Title IV programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of Adtalem’s degree-granting institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on Adtalem’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Certain legislation, provisions in proposed legislation if enacted, or implementation of existing or future law by a current or future administration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including but not limited to legislation that limits the enrollment of U.S. citizens in foreign medical schools, legislation that could require institutions to share in the risk of defaulted federal student loans, and legislation that ties institutions’ eligibility for Title IV funds to the earnings of its graduates.\n\nAdditionally, a shutdown or significant staff reduction of government agencies, such as ED, responsible for administering student financial aid programs under Title IV could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations, delays in origination and disbursement of government-funded student loans to our students, and delays in issuing regulations and guidance related to legislation governing federal financial aid. \n\n18\n\n\nOur ability to comply with some ED regulations is affected by economic forces affecting our students and graduates that are not entirely within our control.\n\nOur ability to comply with several ED regulations is not entirely within our control. In particular, our ability to participate in federal Title IV programs is dependent on the ability of our past students to avoid default on student loans, obtain sufficiently remunerative employment, and of our future students to pay for a portion of their education with private funds. These factors are influenced by broader economic drivers, including the personal or family wealth of our students, the overall employment outlook for their area of study, and the availability of private financing sources. An economic downturn could impact these factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, institutions may lose Title IV eligibility if the most recent cohort default rate on student loans exceeds 40% or if each of the three most recent cohort default rates exceed 30%. According to ED, the default rate for all Title IV institutions nationally was 0.0% for the fiscal year 2021 cohort, 0.0% for the fiscal year 2020 cohort, and 2.3% for the fiscal year 2019 cohort. The recently enacted Do No Harm provisions of OBBBA are discussed in detail in Item 1. “Business” and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We are currently evaluating whether Do No Harm will impact any Adtalem programs.\n\nED rules prohibiting “substantial misrepresentation” create exposure to litigation arising from student and prospective student complaints and enforcement actions by ED that could restrict or eliminate our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nED regulations in effect for federal Stafford loans prohibit any “substantial misrepresentation” by our Title IV institutions, employees, and agents regarding the nature of the institution’s educational programs, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. These regulations may, among other things, subject us to claims of sanctions for statements containing errors made to non-students, including any member of the public, impose liability on us for the conduct of others and expose us to liability even when no actual harm occurs. A “substantial misrepresentation” is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment. It is possible that despite our efforts to prevent misrepresentations, our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. As a result, we may face complaints from students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents in advertising and marketing, during the enrollment, admissions and financial aid process, and throughout attendance at any of our Title IV institutions, which would expose us to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties, including potential Borrower Defense to Repayment liabilities, and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. If ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may (1) fine the institution; (2) discharge students’ debt and hold the institution liable for the discharged debt under the HEA and the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations; and/or (3) suspend or terminate an institution’s participation in Title IV programs. Alternatively, ED may impose certain other limitations on the institution’s participation in Title IV programs, which could include the denial of applications for approval of new programs or locations, a requirement to post a substantial letter of credit, or the imposition of one of ED’s heightened cash monitoring processes. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nA failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nAll of our Title IV institutions are subject to meeting financial and administrative standards. These standards are assessed through annual compliance audits, periodic renewal of institutional PPAs, periodic program reviews, and ad hoc events which may lead ED to evaluate an institution’s financial responsibility or administrative capability. See “Financial Responsibility” and “Administrative Capability” in Item 1. “Business” for additional information.\n\n19\n\n\nIf ED does not recertify any one of our institutions to continue participating in Title IV programs, students at that institution would lose their access to Title IV program funds. Alternatively, ED could recertify our institutions but require our institutions to accept significant limitations as a condition of their continued participation in Title IV programs.\n\nED certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are thus required to seek recertification from ED on a regular basis in order to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by ED if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by ED regulations.\n\nEach of our Title IV institutions operates under a PPA. There can be no assurance that ED will recertify an institution after its PPA expires or that ED will not limit the period of recertification to participate in Title IV programs to less than six years, place the institution on provisional certification, or impose conditions or other restrictions on the institution as a condition of granting our application for recertification. If ED does not renew or withdraws the certification to participate in Title IV programs for one or more of our institutions at any time, students at such institution would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Alternatively, ED could (1) renew the certifications for an institution, but restrict or delay receipt of Title IV funds, limit the number of students to whom an institution could disburse such funds, or place other restrictions on that institution, or (2) delay recertification after an institution’s PPA expires, in which case the institution’s certification would continue on a month-to-month basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the institution or Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of the institution or Adtalem as a whole to operate. See “Program Participation Agreement” in Item 1. “Business” for additional information.\n\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by ED, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nThe loss of institutional accreditation by any of our Title IV institutions would leave the affected institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. In addition, an adverse action by any of our institutional accreditors other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning or probation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by ED in connection with ED’s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other consequences.\n\nIf regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditations and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business.\n\nAny material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution’s accreditors, reauthorization by each institution’s state licensing agencies, and/or providing financial protections. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. The continuing participation of each of our Title IV institutions in Title IV programs is critical to our business. Any disruption in an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, each Title IV institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution’s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review. If our accreditors determine that the change is such that prior approval was required, but was not obtained, many of our accreditors’ policies require the accreditor to consider withdrawal of accreditation. If certain accreditation is suspended or withdrawn with respect to any of our Title IV institutions, they would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs \n\n20\n\n\nuntil the accreditation is reinstated or is obtained from another appropriate accrediting body. There is no assurance that reinstatement of accreditation could be obtained on a timely basis, if at all, and accreditation from a different qualified accrediting authority, if available, would require a significant amount of time. Any material disruption in accreditation would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, some states in which our Title IV institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.\n\nA bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nIn the event of a bankruptcy filing by Adtalem, all of our Title IV institutions would lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, pursuant to statutory provisions of the HEA, notwithstanding the automatic stay provisions of federal bankruptcy law, which would make any reorganization difficult to implement. Similarly, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by any of Adtalem’s subsidiaries that own a Title IV institution, such institution would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In the event of any bankruptcy affecting one or more of our Title IV institutions, ED could hold our other Title IV institutions jointly liable for any Title IV program liabilities, whether asserted or unasserted at the time of such bankruptcy, of the institution whose Title IV program eligibility was terminated.\n\nFurther, in the event that an institution closes and fails to pay liabilities or other amounts owed to ED, ED can attribute the liabilities of that institution to other institutions under common ownership. If any one of our Title IV institutions were to close or have unpaid ED liabilities, ED could seek to have those liabilities repaid by one of our other Title IV institutions.\n\nExcessive student loan defaults could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nOur Title IV institutions may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are greater than standards set by ED. An educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next two federal fiscal years. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if its default rate for a federal fiscal year was greater than 40%. If any of our Title IV institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. See “Cohort Default Rate” in Item 1. “Business” for additional information. Nevertheless, Adtalem’s cohort default rates are far below such thresholds as discussed in “Cohort Default Rate” in Item 1. “Business.”\n\nOur Title IV institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs were too high.\n\nOur Title IV institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, on a cash basis, the percentage of the institution’s revenue derived from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 90%. Further, if an institution exceeds the 90% threshold for any single fiscal year, ED could place that institution on provisional certification status for the institution’s following two fiscal years. See “The 90/10 Rule” in Item 1. “Business” for additional information.\n\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs in that state.\n\nOur Title IV institutions must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution is located. See “State Authorization” in Item 1. “Business” for a description of Adtalem’s current U.S. approvals.\n\nThe loss of state authorization would, among other things, render the affected institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, at least at those state campus locations, and otherwise limit that school’s ability to operate in that state. If these pressures and uncertainty continue in the future, or if one or more of our institutions are unable to offer programs \n\n21\n\n\nin one or more states, it could have a material adverse impact on our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nOur ability to place our medical schools’ students in hospitals in the U.S. may be limited by efforts of certain state government regulatory bodies, which may limit the growth potential of our medical schools, put our medical schools at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, or force our medical schools to substantially reduce their class sizes.\n\nAUC and RUSM enter into affiliation agreements with hospitals across the U.S. to place their third and fourth year students in clinical programs at such hospitals. Certain states with regulatory programs that require state approval of clinical education programs may preclude, limit, or impose onerous requirements on Adtalem’s entry into affiliation agreements with hospitals in their states. If states limit access to affiliation arrangements, our medical schools may be at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, and our medical schools may be required to substantially restrict their enrollment due to limited clinical opportunities for enrolled students. The impact on enrollment, and the potential for enrollment growth, of such restrictions on our medical schools’ clinical placements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nBudget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our enrollment and adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage.\n\nSome states may reduce or eliminate various student financial assistance programs or establish minimum performance measures as a condition of participation. If our students who receive this type of assistance cannot secure alternate sources of funding, they may be forced to withdraw, reduce the rate at which they seek to complete their education, or replace the source with more expensive forms of funding, such as private loans. Other students who would otherwise have been eligible for state financial assistance may not be able to enroll without such aid. This reduced funding could decrease our enrollment and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the reduction or elimination of these non-Title IV sources of student funding may adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage.\n\nWe could be subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\n\nThe HEA and ED regulations require us to calculate refunds of unearned Title IV program funds disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational program. If refunds are not properly calculated or timely paid, we may be required to post a letter of credit with ED or be subject to sanctions or other adverse actions by ED, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nA failure of our vendors to comply with applicable regulations in the servicing of our students and institutions could subject us to fines or restrictions on or loss of our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nWe contract with unaffiliated entities for student software systems and services related to the administration of portions of our Title IV and financing programs. Because each of our institutions may be jointly and severally liable for the actions of third-party servicers and vendors, failure of such servicers to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our institutions, including fines and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. If any of our third-party servicers discontinues providing such services to us, we may not be able to replace such third-party servicer in a timely, cost-efficient, or effective manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with collection, lending, and Title IV requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\n22\n\n\nWe provide financing programs to assist some of our students in affording our educational offerings. These programs are subject to various federal and state rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans, and other injunctive requirements.\n\nIf we, or one of the companies that service our credit programs, do not comply with laws applicable to the financing programs that assist our students in affording our educational offerings, including Truth in Lending and Fair Debt Collections Practices laws and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, we could be subject to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge the debts, and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain or renew licenses, approvals or accreditation, and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nRelease of confidential information could subject us to civil penalties or cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\nAs an educational institution participating in federal and state student assistance programs and collecting financial receipts from enrollees or their sponsors, we collect and retain certain confidential information. Such information is subject to federal and state privacy and security rules, including the Family Education Right to Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Release or failure to secure confidential information or other non-compliance with these rules could subject us to fines, loss of our capacity to conduct electronic commerce, and loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWe could be subject to sanctions if we fail to accurately and timely report sponsored students’ tuition, fees, and enrollment to the sponsoring agency.\n\nA significant portion of our enrollment is sponsored through various federal and state supported agencies and programs, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. As a recipient of funds, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits. Inaccurate or untimely reporting or administration of funds to students could result in suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in these federal and state programs and have a material adverse impact on enrollment and revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nRisks Related to Adtalem’s Business\n\nStudent enrollment at our schools is affected by legislative, regulatory, and economic factors that may change in ways we cannot predict. These factors outside our control limit our ability to assess our future enrollment effectively.\n\nOur future revenue and growth depend on a number of factors, including many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below. Despite ongoing efforts to provide more scholarships and other financing sources to prospective students, and to increase quality and build our reputation, negative perceptions of the value of a college degree, increased reluctance to take on debt, and the resulting lower student consumer confidence may continue to impact enrollment in the future. In addition, technological innovations in the delivery of low-cost education alternatives and increased competition could negatively affect enrollment.\n\nWe are subject to risks relating to enrollment of students. If we are not able to continue to successfully recruit and retain our students, our revenue may decline.\n\nOur undergraduate and graduate educational programs are concentrated in selected areas of medical and healthcare. If applicant career interests or employer needs shift away from these fields, and we do not anticipate or adequately respond to that trend, future enrollment and revenue may decline and the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could decline.\n\n23\n\n\nIf our graduates are unable to find appropriate employment opportunities or obtain professional licensure or certification, we may not be able to recruit new students.\n\nIf employment opportunities for our graduates in fields related to their educational programs decline or they are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications in their chosen fields, future enrollment and revenue may decline as potential applicants choose to enroll at other educational institutions or providers.\n\nWe face heightened competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions.\n\nPostsecondary education in our existing and new market areas is competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges, other proprietary schools, and alternatives to higher education. Some of our competitors, both public and private, have greater financial and nonfinancial resources than us. Some of our competitors, both public and private, are able to offer programs similar to ours at a lower tuition level for a variety of reasons, including the availability of direct and indirect government subsidies, government and foundation grants, large endowments, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions, or by providing fewer student services or larger class sizes. An increasing number of traditional colleges and community colleges are offering distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are geared towards the needs of working adults. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence. As the online and distance learning segment of the postsecondary education market matures, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase. This intense competition could make it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, which could adversely affect our new student enrollment levels and student persistence and put downward pressure on our tuition rates, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOutbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health pandemics in the locations in which we, our students, faculty, and employees live, work, and attend classes, could substantially harm our business.\n\nDisease outbreaks and other public health conditions in the locations in which we, our students, faculty, and employees live, work, and attend classes could have a significant negative impact on our revenue, profitability, and business. We continue to evaluate, and if appropriate, adopt other measures in the future required for the ongoing safety of our students and employees. If our business experiences prolonged occurrences of adverse public health conditions, we believe it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nNatural disasters or other extraordinary events or political disruptions may cause us to close some of our schools or suffer casualty losses.\n\nWe may experience business interruptions or casualty losses resulting from natural disasters, inclement weather, transit disruptions, political disruptions, or other events in one or more of the geographic areas in which we operate, particularly in the West Coast and Gulf States of the U.S., and the Caribbean. These events could impair the value of our assets and/or cause us to close schools, temporarily or permanently, and could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenue to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\n\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees and contractors in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Confidential information also may become available \n\n24\n\n\nto third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition or in connection with system upgrades from time to time.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students’ financial information and grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. Attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Anyone who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot assure that a breach, loss, or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, employees, or contractors that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by federal or state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\n\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our computer network or information systems could severely impact our ability to serve our existing students and attract new students.\n\nThe performance and reliability of our computer networks and system applications, especially online educational platforms and student operational and financial aid packaging applications, are critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. System errors, disruptions or failures, including those arising from unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, and other security threats, could adversely impact our delivery of educational content to our students or result in delays and/or errors in processing student financial aid and related disbursements. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of our institutions, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against system errors, failures or disruptions, or the threat of security breaches, or to repair or otherwise mitigate problems caused by any actual errors, disruptions, failures, or breaches. We cannot ensure that these efforts will protect our computer networks, or fully mitigate the resulting impact of interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, despite our regular monitoring of our technology infrastructure security and business continuity plans.\n\nA breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage, or interrupt the operation of our business.\n\nWe rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. We could experience theft of sensitive data or confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, or personal information belonging to us, our employees, students, or business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect and respond to. There can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our operations and business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Although we maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy covering costs that we may incur in connection with incidents, we nevertheless may incur expenses and losses related to a cyber incident that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of our insurance coverage.\n\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow.\n\nThe use of the internet and other online services has led to and may lead to the adoption of laws and regulations in the U.S. or foreign countries and to changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These laws, regulations, and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, value-added taxes, withholding taxes, cost of internet access, and services, allocation, and apportionment of income amongst \n\n25\n\n\nvarious state, local, and foreign jurisdictions, fair business practices, and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur ability to open new campuses, offer new programs, and add capacity is dependent on regulatory approvals and requires financial and human resources.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to open new campuses, offer new educational programs, and add capacity to certain existing locations. Such actions require us to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, adding new locations, programs, and capacity may require significant financial investments and human resource capabilities. The failure to obtain appropriate approvals or to properly allocate financial and human resources could adversely impact our future growth. The impacts of potential tariffs on supply chains and construction materials may increase the costs of building new campuses.\n\nWe may not be able to attract, retain, and develop key employees necessary for our operations and the successful execution of our strategic plans.\n\nWe may be unable to attract, retain, and develop key employees with appropriate educational qualifications and experience. In addition, we may be unable to effectively plan and prepare for changes in key employees. Such matters may cause us to incur higher wage expense and/or provide less student support and customer service, which could adversely affect enrollment, revenue, and expense. A significant amount of our compensation for key employees is tied to our financial performance. We may require new employees in order to execute some of our strategic plans. Uncertainty regarding our future financial performance may limit our ability to attract new employees with competitive compensation or increase our cost of recruiting and retaining such new employees.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we are actively exploring acquisition opportunities primarily in the U.S. We have acquired and may in the future acquire additional education institutions or education related businesses aligned to our strategy. Any acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\n\n·\n\nInability to successfully integrate the acquired operations and personnel into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;\n\n·\n\nFailure to secure applicable regulatory approvals;\n\n·\n\nAssumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\n·\n\nDiversion of significant attention of our senior management from day-to-day operations;\n\n·\n\nIssues not discovered in our due diligence process, including compliance issues, commitments, and/or contingencies; and\n\n·\n\nFinancial commitments, investments in foreign countries, and compliance with debt covenants and ED financial responsibility scores.\n\nExpansion into new international markets will subject us to risks inherent in international operations.\n\nTo the extent that we expand internationally, we will face risks that are inherent in international operations including, but not limited to:\n\n·\n\nCompliance with foreign laws and regulations;\n\n·\n\nManagement of internal operations;\n\n·\n\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n·\n\nAbility to protect intellectual property;\n\n·\n\nMonetary policy risks, such as inflation, hyperinflation, and deflation;\n\n·\n\nPrice controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies;\n\n·\n\nPolitical and economic instability in the countries in which we operate;\n\n26\n\n\n·\n\nPotential unionization of employees under local labor laws;\n\n·\n\nMultiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws;\n\n·\n\nInability to cost effectively repatriate cash balances; and\n\n·\n\nCompliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nOur effective tax rate could be subject to volatility or be adversely impacted by changes to federal tax laws governing the taxation of foreign earnings of U.S. based companies. For example, recent changes to U.S. tax laws significantly impacted how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws, due in part to recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD’s”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project. This project includes a two-pillar approach to global taxation focusing on global project allocation (Pillar One) and a global minimum tax rate of 15% (Pillar Two). Certain jurisdictions in which we operate enacted legislation consistent with one or more of the OECD Pillar Two model rules, which, in general, are applicable for our fiscal year 2025. We are continuing to evaluate emerging developments related to the Pillar Two model rules and related legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate. These changes increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our effective tax rate in future years.\n\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\n\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of or lapses in various tax law provisions; tax treatment of stock-based compensation; costs related to intercompany or other restructurings; or other changes in tax rates, laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we have accrued tax and related interest for potential adjustments to tax liabilities for prior years, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material effect, either positive or negative, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur goodwill and intangible assets potentially could be impaired if our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted by risks and uncertainties.\n\nAdtalem’s market capitalization can be affected by, among other things, changes in industry or market conditions, changes in results of operations, and changes in forecasts or market expectations related to future results. If our market capitalization were to remain below its carrying value for a sustained period of time or if such a decline becomes indicative that the fair values of our reporting units have declined below their carrying values, an impairment test may result in a non-cash impairment charge. As of June 30, 2025, intangible assets from business combinations totaled $765.5 million and goodwill totaled $961.3 million. Together, these assets equaled 63% of total assets as of such date. If our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted, then such intangible assets and goodwill could be impaired, requiring a possible write-off of up to $765.5 million of intangible assets and up to $961.3 million of goodwill.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be utilized to the full value approved or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Repurchases we consummate could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could have a negative impact on our available cash balance.\n\nOur Board authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $150.0 million of our common stock through May 6, 2028. As of June 30, 2025, $150.0 million of authorized share repurchases were remaining under this share repurchase program. The manner, timing, and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Further, our share repurchases could have an impact on our share trading prices, increase the \n\n27\n\n\nvolatility of the price of our common stock, or reduce our available cash balance. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our common stock. Even if our share repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\nWe and our subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our debt obligations.\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, because we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, repayment of our indebtedness is also dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and other than the guarantors on our indebtedness, they do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose or for other obligations. Pursuant to applicable state limited liability company laws and other laws and regulations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to us in order to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes (as defined in Note 13 “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) and our Term Loan B (as defined in Note 13 “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). In the event that we do not receive distributions from our non-guarantor subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Revolver (as defined in Note 13 “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”) in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\n\nOur ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\n\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default, and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders (including the lenders under the credit facilities and the holders of the Notes) could foreclose against the assets securing their loans and the Notes and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.",
