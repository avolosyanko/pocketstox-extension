We are subject to other risks discussed under \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors,\" and under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as risks that may be discussed in other reports filed with the SEC. As noted under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above, these factors could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Investors and other readers are urged to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating our business.\n\n•The residential real estate market is cyclical, and we are negatively impacted by downturns and disruptions in this market, including factors that impact homesale transaction volume (homesale sides times average homesale price), such as:\n\n◦prolonged periods of a high mortgage rate and/or high inflation rate environment;\n\n◦continued or accelerated reductions in housing affordability, whether at initial purchase or ongoing ownership cost; \n\n◦insufficient or excessive home inventory levels by market or price point;\n\n◦continued or accelerated declines, or the absence of significant increases, in the number of home sales;\n\n◦stagnant or declining home prices; and\n\n◦changes in consumer preferences in the U.S.; \n\n•We are negatively impacted by adverse developments or the absence of sustained improvement in macroeconomic conditions (such as business, economic or political conditions) on a global, domestic or local basis;\n\n•Changes to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market (regardless of whether such changes are driven by regulatory action, litigation outcomes, or otherwise) could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results, including, but not limited to, changes related to:\n\n◦the clear cooperation policy, which is a National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) mandated policy that requires a listing broker to submit a listing to the multiple listing services (\"MLSs\") for cooperation with other MLS participants within a specified time of marketing a property to the public (the “Clear Cooperation Policy”);\n\n◦the rules mandating participation in state and national Realtor associations in order to post on the local MLS; and\n\n◦the rules limiting access to lock-boxes used to facilitate property showings and the rules that limit display of co-mingled MLS and non-MLS listings;\n\n•Risks related to the impact of evolving competitive and consumer dynamics on both the Company and affiliated franchisees, whether driven by competitive or regulatory factors or other changes to industry rules or practices, which could include, but are not limited to:\n\n◦meaningful decreases in the average homesale broker commission rate (including the average buy-side commission rate);\n\n◦continued erosion of our share of the commission income generated by homesale transactions;\n\n◦our ability (and the ability of affiliated joint ventures and franchisees) to compete against traditional and non-traditional competitors, including those that adapt more effectively, including by growing inorganically, to the continuing downturn in the housing market and the changes in industry rules and practices; \n\n◦our ability to adapt our business to changing consumer preferences; and\n\n◦further disruption in the residential real estate brokerage industry related to listing aggregator market power and concentration, including with respect to ancillary services; \n\n•Our business and financial results may be materially and adversely impacted if we are unable to execute our business strategy, including if we are not successful in our efforts to:\n\n◦recruit and retain productive independent sales agents and teams, and other agent-facing talent;\n\n◦attract and retain franchisees or renew existing franchise agreements without reducing contractual royalty rates or increasing the amount and prevalence of sales incentives;\n\n◦develop or procure products, services and technology that support our strategic initiatives;\n\n◦successfully adopt and integrate artificial intelligence and similar technology into our products and services;\n\n◦achieve or maintain cost savings and other benefits from our cost-saving initiatives;\n\n◦generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads for independent sales agents and franchisees; and\n\n◦complete, integrate or realize the expected benefits of acquisitions and joint ventures; \n\n•Adverse developments or resolutions in litigation, in particular large scale litigation, involving significant claims, such as class action antitrust litigation and litigation related to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\n•Our substantial indebtedness, alone or in combination with other factors, particularly heightened during industry downturns or broader recessions, could (i) adversely limit our operations, including our ability to grow our business whether organically or via acquisitions, (ii) adversely impact our liquidity including, but not limited to, with respect to our interest obligations and the negative covenant restrictions contained in our debt agreements and/or (iii) adversely impact our ability, and any actions we may take, to refinance, restructure or repay our indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;\n\n•We have substantial indebtedness that will mature (or may spring forward) in 2026 and we may not be able to refinance or restructure any such debt on terms as favorable as those of currently outstanding debt, or at all;\n\n•An event of default under our material debt agreements would adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness;\n\n•A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future;\n\n•Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase;\n\n•Our financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely impacted by risks related to our business structure, including, but not limited to:\n\n◦the operating results of affiliated franchisees and their ability to pay franchise and related fees;\n\n◦continued consolidation among our top 250 franchisees;\n\n◦challenges relating to the owners of the two brands we do not own; \n\n◦the geographic and high-end market concentration of our company owned brokerages;\n\n◦the loss of our largest real estate benefit program client or continued reduction in spending on relocation services; \n\n◦the failure of third-party vendors or partners to perform as expected or our failure to adequately monitor them; \n\n◦our ability to continue to securitize certain of the relocation assets of Cartus;\n\n◦our reliance on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness; and\n\n◦the negligence or intentional actions of affiliated franchisees and their independent sales agents or independent sales agents engaged by our company owned brokerages, which are traditionally outside of our control;\n\n•Risks related to legal and regulatory matters may cause us to incur increased costs and/or result in adverse financial, operational or reputational consequences to us, including but not limited to, our failure or alleged failure to comply with laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations and any changes or stricter interpretations of any of the foregoing, including but not limited to: (1) antitrust laws and regulations, (2) the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\") or other federal or state consumer protection or similar laws, (3) state or federal employment laws or regulations that would require reclassification of independent contractor sales agents to employee status, (4) the TCPA and any related laws limiting solicitation of business, and (5) privacy or cybersecurity laws and regulations;\n\n•We face reputational, business continuity and legal and financial risks associated with cybersecurity incidents;\n\n•The weakening or unavailability of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business;\n\n•Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to further impairment which could negatively impact our earnings;\n\n•We could be subject to significant losses if banks do not honor our escrow and trust deposits;\n\n•Changes in accounting standards and management assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact on us; \n\n•We face risks related to potential attrition among our senior executives or other key employees and related to our ability to develop our existing workforce and to recruit talent in order to advance our business strategies;\n\n•We face risks related to our Exchangeable Senior Notes and exchangeable note hedge and warrant transactions;\n\n•We face risks related to severe weather events, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as the wildfires recently impacting California;\n\n•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations related to corporate sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks;\n\n•Market forecasts and estimates, including our internal estimates, may prove to be inaccurate; and\n\n•We face risks related to our common stock, including that price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\n3\n\n\nTRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS\n\nWe own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business.

Our general telephone number is (973) 407-2000. The Company files electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") required reports on Form 8-K, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K; proxy materials; registration statements and other forms or reports as required. Certain of the Company's officers and directors also file ownership reports for insiders as required by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such materials may be accessed electronically on the SEC's Internet site (www.sec.gov). We maintain an Internet website at http://anywhere.re and make available free of charge on or through our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Section 16 reports and any amendments to these reports in the Investors section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website address is provided as an inactive textual reference. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise a part of this Annual Report.\n\nMARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS\n\nThis Annual Report includes historical data, forecasts and information obtained from independent sources such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\"), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the \"Federal Reserve\"), NAR, the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\"), trade associations, industry publications and surveys, and other information available to us. Some data is also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from management’s knowledge of the industry and independent sources. While we believe that the industry data presented herein is derived from the most widely recognized sources for reporting U.S. residential housing market statistical data, we caution that such information is subject to change and do not endorse or suggest reliance on this data or information alone. For example, in 2022, NAR significantly revised its previously published average (mean) sales price (“ASP”) data for U.S. existing homes for prior periods, which resulted in discontinuing our usage of NAR ASP data in our SEC filings.\n\nForecasts regarding rates of home ownership, sales price, volume of homesales, and other metrics included in this Annual Report to describe the housing industry are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but such information may not be accurate or complete. We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Statements as to our market position are based on market data currently available to us. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding industry data provided herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon various factors, including those discussed under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable, even though such research has not been verified by any independent sources.\n\nIndustry Overview \n\nIndustry definition. We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:\n\n•the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 4.7 million homesales in the U.S. in 2024, NAR estimates that approximately 4.1 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 86% of the overall sales as measured in units;\n\n•existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and\n\n•we are able to generate revenues from other Company services provided to our customers.\n\nOur business model relies heavily on affiliated independent sales agents, who play a critical consumer-facing role in the home buying and selling experience for both our company owned and franchise brokerages. While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, approximately 88% of home buyers and 90% of home sellers used an agent or broker in 2024. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved \n\n6\n\n\nin most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:\n\n•the average homesale transaction value is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;\n\n•homesale transactions occur infrequently;\n\n•there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;\n\n•a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services as well as assistance with the inspection process and other aspects of the transaction; \n\n•the consumer preference to visit properties for sale in person, notwithstanding the availability of online images and property tours; and\n\n•there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space. \n\nCyclical nature of industry, long-term demographics and seasonality. The U.S. residential real estate industry exhibits a cyclical nature, characterized by periods of downturns as observed since mid-2022 and from 2006 to 2011, followed by phases of recovery and growth, exemplified from 2012 to 2021. Currently, the market is at historic lows, with 2023 and 2024 having the lowest homesale transactions since 1995, according to NAR data. These cycles are typically affected by broader economic shifts and conditions within the residential real estate market, factors largely beyond our control.\n\nWe believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is impacted by various factors. Chief among these are housing affordability, the overall economic well-being of the U.S., and pivotal demographic trends, including generational transitions, and the rise in U.S. household formations. Elements such as mortgage rates and mortgage availability, tax incentives, job market dynamics, the conversion of renters to homebuyers, and the intrinsic benefits associated with homeownership further contribute to the industry's trajectory. \n\nWhile the U.S. residential real estate market experienced substantial declines since 2022, we maintain an optimistic outlook on the growth of the residential real estate market over the mid to long term. Our optimism is rooted in the anticipation of enduring positive fundamentals, such as U.S. population over the last decade, and the expected growth in the number of U.S. households, particularly among the millennial generation, over the coming decade. \n\nThe U.S. residential housing market is also seasonal. Typically, a heightened volume of homesale transactions occurs in the second and third quarters of each year. Consequently, our historical data reveals stronger operating results and revenues during these periods.\n\nUncertainties Relating to the Residential Real Estate Industry. The U.S. residential real estate brokerage industry is currently in the midst of a period of significant uncertainty driven by actual and potential changes to a number of industry rules or practices that impact the functioning of the U.S. residential brokerage industry and our business. For more information, see \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\" and \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks\".\n\nParticipation in Multiple Aspects of Residential Real Estate\n\nWe participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our complementary businesses and minority-held joint ventures, including our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures, work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation, lead generation services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and real estate benefit program clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. All of our businesses and our minority-owned joint ventures can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.\n\n7\n\n\nOur Brands \n\nOur brands are among the most well-known and established real estate brokerage brands in the real estate industry.\n\nTogether with our strategic joint ventures, our brands allow us to leverage our strengths, while participating in multiple markets within the real estate industry. Specifically, while all of our brands compete to varying extents in the high-end markets, our Sotheby’s International Realty® and Corcoran® brands are particularly well-positioned to benefit from growth in high-end markets. Likewise, while all of our brands utilize offerings through Title Group, our company owned Coldwell Banker® brand shares synergies with our title business as well as our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures that allow us to progress towards our goal to integrate and streamline the residential real estate transaction. In addition, our global franchise brands including Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate, CENTURY 21® and ERA®, as well as franchised Sotheby’s International Realty®, Corcoran® and Coldwell Banker® brokerages, provide us with attractive scale and afford us the ability to offer versatility of choice to franchisees and consumers.\n\nOur real estate brands are listed in the following chart, which includes information as of December 31, 2024, for both our franchised and company owned offices:\n\nBrands (1)\n\nWorldwide Offices (2)\n\n11,0002,9001,1002,300400100\n\nWorldwide Brokers and \n\nSales Agents (2)\n\n130,20096,30026,10043,20011,2004,900\n\nU.S. Annual Sides\n\n219,329468,004117,86070,09258,23116,494\n\n# of Countries and Territories with Owned or Franchised Operations\n\n7945843769\n\nCharacteristics\n\nA 50+ year leader in brand awareness and a top recognized and respected name in real estate\n\nSignificant international office footprint\n\n119-year legacy in real estate\n\n    Coldwell Banker Global Luxury® program to uniquely market top tier listings\n\n    Long-time industry leader in effective advertising\n\nSynonymous with luxury Strong ties to auction house established in 1744Powerful global presenceLongstanding commitment to technology and innovationDriving performance through innovation, collaboration, diversity and growthUnique opportunity for flexible brandingStrong brand name recognition\n\nUnique access to consumers, marketing channels and content through brand licensing relationship with a leading media company\n\nLeading residential real estate brand for 50+ years\n\nCommitment to white-glove service, customer-centric brand, and \"Live Who You Are\" philosophy\n\n_______________\n\n(1)Information presented for Coldwell Banker® includes Coldwell Banker Commercial®.\n\n(2)Includes information reported to us by independently owned franchisees (including approximately 12,500 offices and approximately 132,700 related brokers and independent sales agents of non-U.S. franchisees and franchisors).\n\n8\n\n\nAnywhere Brands—Franchise Group\n\nOverview—Franchise Business\n\nFranchise Group is comprised of our franchise business as well as our lead generation and relocation services operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 311,900 independent sales agents worldwide, including approximately 179,200 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. (which included approximately 52,900 company owned brokerage independent sales agents). As of December 31, 2024, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 17,800 offices worldwide in 119 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 5,300 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 580 company owned brokerage offices).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, on a year-over-year basis, independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages experienced a 7% decline (based on the Company's internal data) and independent sales agents affiliated with our U.S. franchisees experienced a 4% decline (based on information provided by our affiliated franchisees).\n\nThe average tenure among our U.S. franchisees is approximately 23 years as of December 31, 2024. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with servicing programs, technology, and learning and development as well as dedicated national marketing programs to facilitate our franchisees in developing their business.\n\nOur primary objectives as a franchisor of residential real estate brokerages are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support (including via proprietary and third-party products and services) to our franchisees and their independent sales agents.\n\nOperations—Franchising\n\nWe derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees and Owned Brokerage Group for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales commission earned from closed homesale sides, which we refer to as gross commission income.\n\nFranchise Group's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides (either the \"buy\" side and/or the \"sell\" side of a real estate transaction) in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate. Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved, if applicable, and net of other incentives granted to franchisees.\n\nIn addition to domestic royalty revenue, Franchise Group earns revenue from marketing fees, the strategic alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees.\n\nDuring 2024, none of our franchisees (other than Owned Brokerage Group) generated more than 3% of the total revenue of our real estate franchise business.\n\nOur franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) are independent business operators and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations, including with respect to their pricing, hiring or affiliation practices.\n\nDomestic Franchisees. Franchise agreements set forth certain limited guidelines on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the mandatory identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years.\n\nThese franchisee agreements generally require the franchisee to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus a royalty fee that is a percentage of gross commission income, if any, earned by the franchisee. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways, and we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or \n\n9\n\n\nrestructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.\n\nCertain of our brands utilize a volume-based incentive model with a royalty fee rate that is initially equal to 6% of the franchisee's gross commission income, but subject to reduction based upon volume incentives. Under this model, the franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. The volume incentive varies for each franchise system. We provide a detailed table to each eligible franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations.\n\nCertain franchisees (including some of our largest franchisees) have a flat percentage royalty fee. Under this model, franchisees pay a fixed percentage (generally less than 6%) of their commission income to us and the percentage does not change during the year or over the term of their franchise agreement. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOur Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise business utilizes a capped fee model, which has applied to any new franchisee since 2019 as well as preexisting franchisees who elect to switch from their current royalty fee structure to the capped fee model. Under this model, franchisees pay a royalty fee (generally equal to 5% of their commission income) capped at a set amount per independent sales agent per year, subject to our right to annually modify or increase the independent sales agent cap. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOur Corcoran franchise business utilizes a tiered royalty fee model under which franchisees pay us a percentage of their gross commission income as a royalty fee. The royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 6% and decreases in steps during each calendar year to a minimum of 4% as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels. Similarly, our Coldwell Banker® residential franchise business began offering a tiered royalty fee model in 2021, under which the royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 5.5% and decreases in steps during the calendar year to a minimum of 3% as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels. Under this tiered royalty fee model, we reserve the right to annually modify or increase the gross commission income levels, subject to certain limitations. Franchisees on the tiered royalty fee model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOther incentives may be used as consideration to attract new franchisees, grow franchisees (including through independent sales agent recruitment) or extend existing franchise agreements. Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes or other note-backed funding which we provide to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Franchisees may also use the proceeds from note-backed funding to update marketing materials or upgrade technology and websites. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed, and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably generally over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met or the franchise agreement terminates, franchisees may be required to repay a portion of the outstanding notes.\n\nEach of our current franchise systems requires franchisees and company owned brokerages to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand in accordance with the applicable franchise agreement. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations, broker and agent marketing tools and products and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, in certain instances, Franchise Group may be required to make contributions to certain marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.\n\nIn addition to offices owned and operated by our third-party franchisees, as of December 31, 2024, we, through Owned Brokerage Group, own and operate approximately 580 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® brand names. The domestic royalty revenue from Owned Brokerage Group is calculated by multiplying (i) homesale sides by (ii) average sale price by (iii) average brokerage commission rate by (iv) their contractual royalty rate. Owned Brokerage Group pays intercompany royalty fees of approximately 6% and marketing fees to Franchise Group in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment \n\n10\n\n\nlevel and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses. Owned Brokerage Group does not participate in volume incentive or other incentive programs.\n\nInternational Third-Party Franchisees. In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators. We also utilize a direct franchising model outside of the U.S. for Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® and, in some cases, Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. For all other brands, we generally employ a master franchise model outside of the U.S., whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. Under both the direct and master franchise models outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties. Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.\n\nWe have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's (\"Sotheby's\"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices. Our license agreement is terminable by Sotheby's prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, (3) a court issues a non-appealable, final judgment that we have committed certain breaches of the license agreement and we fail to cure such breaches within 60 days of the issuance of such judgment, or (4) we discontinue the use of all of the trademarks licensed under the license agreement for a period of twelve consecutive months.\n\nIn October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith Operations Corporation, successor in interest to Meredith Corporation (\"Meredith Ops\"). The license agreement between Anywhere and Meredith Ops is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith Ops for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee. Our license agreement is terminable by Meredith Ops prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, or (3) a trial court issues a final judgment that we are in material breach of the license agreement or any representation or warranty we made was false or materially misleading when made.\n\nOperations—Other\n\nCartus® Relocation Services. Cartus, a provider of global relocation services, offers a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for employee and employer. The wide range of services we offer allow our clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us. Our broad array of services include, but are not limited to, homesale assistance, relocation policy counseling and group move management services, consulting services, expense processing and relocation-related accounting, compensation support and compliance, and visa and immigration support. We also arrange household goods moving services and provide support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods.\n\nWe primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, including 38% of the Fortune 50 companies in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 25 years with us. Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If \n\n11\n\n\na client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.\n\nThere are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn a commission from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. Furthermore, Cartus continues to provide value through the generation of leads to real estate agent and brokerage participants in the networks maintained by Leads Group, which drives downstream revenue for our businesses.\n\nLead Generation. Through Leads Group, a part of Franchise Group, we seek to provide high-quality leads to independent sales agents, through real estate benefit programs that provide home-buying and selling assistance to customers of lenders, organizations such as credit unions and interest groups that have established members who are buying or selling a home as well as to consumers and corporations who have expressed interest in a certain brand, product or service (such as relocation services), including those offered by Anywhere. Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated, with one client-directed real estate benefit program contributing a substantial majority of the high-quality leads generated through our lead generation programs, and our client-directed programs are non-exclusive and terminable at any time at the option of the client. We also maintain Company-driven real estate benefit programs and additional leads may be generated via other strategic initiatives, including through consumer-focused products and services we may develop or offer. We expect that significant time, effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of, and participation in, programs, partnerships or products and services that are intended to aid in lead generation.\n\nStrategic Alliance Program. We offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our strategic alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us an initial access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the strategic alliance vendors.\n\nAnywhere Advisors—Owned Brokerage Group \n\nOverview\n\nThrough Owned Brokerage Group we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in many of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our brokerage offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® franchised brands.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 580 company owned brokerage offices and approximately 52,900 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices. Of those offices, we operated approximately 88% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 8% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and approximately 4% of our offices under the Corcoran® brand name.\n\nWe intend to continue to seek to increase the productivity of company owned brokerage offices, including by optimizing efficiencies, streamlining transactional processes and centralizing back-office operations. We will continue to work with office managers to attract and retain independent sales agents who can successfully engage in and promote transactions from new and existing clients. From time to time, we may also execute strategic acquisitions. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations to reduce or eliminate duplicative costs and to leverage our existing infrastructure to support newly affiliated independent sales agents.\n\nOperations—Brokerage\n\nOur company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received for serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.37%, which represents the average commission rate earned on either the \"buy\" side or the \"sell\" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. Owned Brokerage Group, as a franchisee of Franchise Group, pays marketing fees and a royalty fee of approximately 6% of the gross commission income earned per real estate transaction to Franchise Group; however, such amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Owned Brokerage Group paid marketing fees and royalties to Franchise Group of $319 million and $315 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n12\n\n\nThe remainder of gross commission income is split between the broker (Owned Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement (which specifies the portion of the broker commission to be paid to the agent), which varies by agent.\n\nIn addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services offered through our other segments, including title, escrow and settlement, mortgage origination, homeowners insurance and relocation services. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.\n\nWhen we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with an array of services, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, and assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In addition, Owned Brokerage Group has relationships with developers in select major cities (in particular New York City) to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.\n\nAnywhere Integrated Services—Title Group\n\nOverview\n\nTitle Group is comprised of our title agency business that conducts title, escrow and settlement services and also includes the Company' share of equity earnings and losses from certain non-exclusive joint ventures, including, among others, Guaranteed Rate Affinity (a mortgage origination joint venture) and the title insurance underwriter joint venture (see below under the header \"Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture\" for additional information). Our equity earnings or losses related to minority-owned joint ventures such as Guaranteed Rate Affinity and the title insurance underwriter joint venture are included in the financial results of Title Group but are not reported as revenue to Title Group. \n\nOur title agency business provides title search, examination, clearance and policy issuance services and conducts the closing process and funds disbursement for lenders, real estate agents, attorneys and homebuilders and their customers on purchase transactions and lenders and their customers on refinance transactions. \n\nWe intend to grow our title, escrow and settlement services business by recruiting successful title and escrow sales personnel in existing markets. We will also seek to increase our capture rate of title business from Owned Brokerage Group homesale sides.\n\nOperations\n\nTitle Agency Services; Title, Escrow and Settlement Services. We are licensed as a title agent in 43 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 350 offices, approximately 126 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices. In addition to our own title, escrow and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution clients on a national basis.\n\nOur title, escrow and settlement services business provides full-service title, escrow and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to consumers, real estate companies, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses. We provide closing and escrow services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from financial institutions and loan officers throughout the mortgage lending industry. \n\nOur company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title, escrow and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Many of our offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. In 2024, our title, escrow and settlement services business was involved in approximately 39,000 transactions related to Owned Brokerage Group. The capture rate of our title, escrow and settlement services business from buyers or sellers represented by our company owned brokerages was approximately 31% in 2024. Other sources of our title, escrow and settlement services homesale business include Franchise Group, Leads Group, home builders and unaffiliated brokerage operations.\n\nVirtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the \n\n13\n\n\nstandard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search (searching for and retrieving all public records concerning the property and its owners) may be performed by the title agent, an underwriter or contracted to a third party while the examination function (inspecting all such public records for any defects in the chain of title) is always performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium \"split\" is generally determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter and, in some states, is promulgated by state law. We derive revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold.\n\nWe have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses.\n\nOther Revenue. Other revenue generated by our title agency business includes closing protection letters, title searches, survey business, tax search, wire fees, and other fees ancillary to their services.\n\nJoint Ventures. \n\nMortgage Origination. Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, Inc. (\"Guaranteed Rate\"), began doing business in August 2017. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates mortgage loans, including both purchase and refinancing transactions, to be sold in the secondary market. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates and markets its mortgage lending services to real estate agents across the country (including to independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchised brokerages) and relocation companies (including our relocation operations) as well as a broad consumer audience. \n\nMany of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. Our company owned brokerage operations represented approximately half of Guaranteed Rate Affinity's purchase transactions, as well as approximately half of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s mortgage origination business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nUnder the Operating Agreement (the \"GRA Agreement\") between a subsidiary of Title Group and a subsidiary of Guaranteed Rate (the \"GRA Member\"), we own 49.9% of the home mortgage joint venture and Guaranteed Rate indirectly owns the remaining 50.1%. Under the GRA Agreement, Guaranteed Rate Affinity is to distribute to each of the Company and Guaranteed Rate the distributable net income based on each member's ownership interest percentage following the close of each quarter. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture. Guaranteed Rate Affinity is licensed to conduct mortgage operations in 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe GRA Agreement is for an initial 10-year term (ending August 2027) and automatically renews for additional 5-year terms, unless either party provides advance notice to terminate, provided that if certain performance metrics are achieved after the fifth year of the agreement, the first 5-year extension is not subject to termination upon advance notice. Either party can terminate the GRA Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, a change in control of the other member, subject to certain exceptions, or upon material breach by the other member not remediated within the cure period. We have certain additional performance-based termination rights.\n\nThe GRA Agreement does not prohibit Guaranteed Rate, directly or indirectly through joint ventures with other parties, from operating its separate mortgage origination business and does not limit the Company, Guaranteed Rate, or either of their subsidiaries from operating non-mortgage origination lines of business in locations where Guaranteed Rate Affinity operates. In addition, the Company is permitted to have ventures with other mortgage loan originators, but Guaranteed Rate has a 30-day right-of-first-refusal to acquire any mortgage origination business that we intend to acquire.\n\nTitle Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture. In March 2022, the Company sold its title insurance underwriter, Title Resources Guaranty Company (the \"Title Underwriter\") (previously reported in the Title Group reportable segment) in exchange for cash and a minority equity stake in the form of common units in a title insurance underwriter joint venture that owns the Title Underwriter (the \"Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture\"). The Company owns a 22% equity interest and other joint venture partners own a majority equity stake in the joint venture in the form of preferred units that carry liquidation preference rights. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with a subsidiary of the Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture related to the sale of 10% of the preferred equity in entities containing the assets of certain of the Company's title and escrow entities for $18.8 million, with a right to purchase 100% of those entities at the same valuation \n\n14\n\n\nused for the initial purchase. The transaction includes customary minority protections, is contingent on certain conditions, and remains subject to termination provisions outlined in the term sheet.\n\nProducts, Technology and Marketing\n\nProducts and Technology—Agents. Core to our integrated business strategy is our ability to provide independent sales agents at company owned and franchised brokerages with compelling data and technology-powered products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable.\n\nThe marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously develop and improve our marketing and technology-powered products and services is part of our value proposition to company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our other businesses. Increasingly, these products and services are desired as an integrated set of tools, rather than stand-alone products and services.\n\nWe continue to develop product and marketing capabilities designed to support the continuous creation and delivery of both our proprietary tools and third-party products to affiliated independent sales agents in order to deliver a more comprehensive platform experience. Our technology platform is designed to offer affiliated independent sales agents and brokers seamless access to both proprietary tools and third-party products, enabling choice among such agents and brokers to leverage the mix of tools that best serve their needs.\n\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop or procure marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of affiliated independent sales agents. \n\nOur Anywhere-provided platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our independent sales agents, franchisees (and their independent sales agents) and consumers by:\n\n•aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions;\n\n•connecting affiliated agents and brokers to a CRM tool that allows for the cultivation of productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction;\n\n•enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites; \n\n•informing affiliated agents of valuable client insight to help those agents increase their productivity;\n\n•providing consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents;\n\n•providing key back-office processes, including listing and transaction management, reporting, marketing, and agent profiles; and\n\n•delivering business planning tools that enable our franchisees to track their progress against key business objectives in real time.\n\nProducts and Technology—Consumers. We continue to focus on the consumer experience as well, seeking to improve the experience of buying and selling a home by creating an easier and integrated experience for all parts of a consumer's transaction. We expect to continue to invest in the development and/or procurement of products and technology designed to deliver valuable capabilities via digital channels throughout the lifecycle of home ownership.\n\nMarketing. Each of our brands manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive leads to affiliated agents, increase brand awareness and perception, promote our network and offerings to the real estate industry and engage our customer base.\n\nEach of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees (including company owned offices), although we may make discretionary contributions to any of the marketing funds and in certain instances are required to make contributions to certain marketing funds.\n\nLikewise, our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.\n\n15\n\n\nOur marketing programs, tools and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective affiliated independent sales agents by:\n\n•showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the listing agents of these properties;\n\n•building and maintaining brand awareness and preference for the brand; and\n\n•increasing the local recognition of affiliated agents and brokerages.\n\nMarketing programs are executed using a variety of media including, but not limited to, social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising. \n\nListings and Websites. The internet is the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We transmit listings to various platforms and services, place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites, and operate a variety of our own websites. We place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers.\n\nOur brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. Additionally, each brand website allows independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers. \n\nEducation\n\nEach real estate brand provides franchisees access to learning, development, and continuing education materials for use in connection with their real estate sales businesses. Use of such materials by affiliated brokers and independent sales agents is voluntary and discretionary. Independent sales agents affiliated with a company owned brokerage must complete onboarding training and compliance training related to fair housing (in addition to their state licensing fair housing obligations).\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nEmployees. Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy. Our team includes a broad range of professionals, given the breadth of services offered by our three business segments and Corporate. The wide array of skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefits our operations and performance.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,805 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees. At December 31, 2024, approximately 575 of our employees were located outside of the U.S., almost all of whom were employed by Cartus (a part of Anywhere Brands).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately half of our employees continued to work remotely on a full-time basis. Certain employees, in particular consumer-facing employees at our company-owned brokerages, operated in an office-based environment, while other employees worked in a hybrid model.\n\nNone of our employees are represented by a union.\n\nTo assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we annually survey employees with the assistance of third-party consultants and implement actions to address areas of employee feedback. In 2024, we achieved an 86% engagement score and an 87% response rate.\n\nAll employees are required to participate in annual training programs designed to address subjects of key importance to our business, including the Company’s Code of Ethics. Nearly 100% of active employees in each of the past three years have completed our annual Code of Ethics training. Code of Ethics training in 2024 covered topics such as promoting an ethical culture, reporting conflicts of interest, and compliance with RESPA. Other mandatory training in 2024 included global information security and data governance. Biennial anti-harassment training is delivered to all employees and more frequently based on position or where required by law. Certain employees also receive training on topics such as preventing global modern slavery, insider trading, California workplace violence, and unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices training, and additional mandatory training courses are delivered based upon the employee position or local requirements. Our learning and development platform offers employees additional resources to continue to grow professionally, including access to on-demand training through LinkedIn Learning and tools for career management. \n\n16\n\n\nIndependent Sales Agents. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, the successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of our company owned brokerage operations. Additional information about the base of independent sales agents affiliated with company owned brokerages as well as franchisees is located in this Item 1. under \"Anywhere Brands—Franchise Group—Overview—Franchise Business.\"\n\nCompetition\n\nReal Estate Brokerage Industry. The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company-owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the economic relationship between the broker and the agent (including the share of commission income retained by the agent and fees charged to or paid by the agent for services provided by the broker), consumer preferences, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors, including macro-economic factors such as national, regional and local economic conditions. In addition, the legal and regulatory environment as well as the rules of NAR, industry associations and MLSs can impact competition. See \"Government and Other Regulations\" below.\n\nWe and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business as well as for independent sales agents with national and regional independent real estate brokerages and franchisors, discount and limited service brokerages, non-traditional market participants, and with franchisees of our brands. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate), Howard Hanna Holdings, Compass, Inc. (which recently acquired @properties), Redfin Corporation, EXP Realty (a subsidiary of eXp World Holdings, Inc.), Weichert Realtors as well as several large franchisors, including RE/MAX International, Inc., Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and HSF Affiliates LLC (operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate). We and affiliated franchisees also compete with leading listing aggregators, such as Zillow, Inc. and Realtor.com® (a listing aggregator held by News Corp.) as well as Homes.com (a listing aggregator held by CoStar Group, Inc.). In addition, we and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business with several iBuyers, including Opendoor and Offerpad.\n\nCompetition for Independent Sales Agents. The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is critical to the business and financial results of traditional brokerages—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition for productive independent sales agents in our industry is high and competition is most intense for highly productive independent sales agents with strong reputations in their respective communities. \n\nMost of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of its independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated and other company-generated leads. Many factors impact recruitment and retention efforts, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for independent sales agents from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, technology offerings as well as marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the quality of the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, the location and quality of office space, as well as continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. \n\nWe believe that a variety of factors in recent years have negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents in the industry generally and have increasingly impacted our recruitment and retention of top producing agents and put upward pressure on the average share of commissions paid to affiliated independent sales agents. Such factors include increasing competition, increasing levels of commissions paid to agents (including up-front payments and equity), changes in the spending patterns of independent sales agents (as more agents purchase services from third parties outside of their affiliated broker), a heightening focus on leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales agent from the brokerage, differentiation in the bundling of agent services or industry offerings (including virtual brokerages or other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income, or other compensation, such as marketing funds and sign-on or equity awards), and the growth in independent sales agent teams. Competition comes from newer models as well, including brokerages that provide certain services to agents and agent teams, but with branding focused on the name of the agent or agent team, rather than the brokerage brand.\n\nCommission Plan Competition Among Real Estate Brokerages. Some of the firms competing for sales agents use different commission plans, which may be appealing to certain sales agents. There are several different commission plan variations that have been historically utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents. One of the most common variations has been the traditional graduated commission model where the independent sales agent receives a \n\n17\n\n\npercentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales agent increases his or her volume of homesale transactions, and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales agents with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties. Other common plans include a desk rental (sometimes referred to as a 100% commission plan), a fixed transaction fee commission plan, and a capped commission plan. A capped commission plan generally blends aspects of the traditional graduated commission model with the 100% commission plan. Although less common, some real estate brokerages employ their sales agents, and in such instances, employee agents may earn smaller brokerage commissions in exchange for other employee benefits or bonuses. Most brokerages focus primarily on one type of commission plan, though some may offer one or more commission plan variations to their sales agents.\n\nIn many of their markets, Owned Brokerage Group offers a traditional graduated commission model, which emphasizes our value proposition. The traditional graduated commission model has experienced declines in market share over the past several years. Increasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed.\n\nLow Barriers to Entry. The real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants utilizing historical real estate brokerage models and those pursuing alternative variations of those models (including virtual brokerages and brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income) as well as non-traditional methods of marketing real estate (such as iBuyers). There are also market participants who differentiate themselves by offering consumers flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions (often coupled with fewer services). The significant size of the U.S. real estate market has continued to attract outside capital investment in disruptive and traditional competitors that seek to access a portion of this market. These competitors and their investors may pursue increases in market share over profitability, further complicating the competitive landscape. \n\nNon-Traditional Competition and Industry Disruption. While real estate brokers using historical real estate brokerage models typically compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, brokerage commission, reputation, utilization of technology and personal contacts, participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate may compete in other ways, including companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models or minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model.\n\nA growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, virtual brokerage and other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income, known in the industry as a higher \"split\" (or other compensation, such as sign-on or equity awards), directly compete with traditional brokerage models and may dilute the relationship between the brokerage and the agent and add additional competitive pressure for independent sales agent talent. Likewise, certain alternative transaction models that are less reliant on brokerages and sales agents could have a negative impact on such brokerages and agents as well as on the average homesale broker commission rate. These models also look to capture other real estate services such as title and mortgage services and referral fees. Changes to industry rules and/or the introduction of disruptive products and services may also result in an increase in the number of transactions that do not utilize the services of independent sales agents, including for sale by owner transactions. \n\nIn addition, the concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions including, but not limited to, setting up competing brokerages and/or expanding their offerings to include products (such as agent tools) and services that are a part of or related to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us, charging significant referral, listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. These actions divert and reduce the earnings of other industry participants, including our company owned and franchised brokerages. Aggregators could intensify their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry. Such tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with affiliated franchisees and such franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and buyers and sellers of homes.\n\nFranchise Competition. According to NAR, approximately 40% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and \n\n18\n\n\nimprove the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and can include volume and other incentives, flat royalty and marketing fees, capped royalty fees, and discounted royalty and marketing fees. Taking into account competitive factors, we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.\n\nRelocation Operations. Competition in our corporate relocation operations is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation service providers in the corporate relocation operations. The larger outsourced relocation service providers that we compete with include SIRVA Worldwide, Inc., Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc., Aires and Graebel Companies, Inc. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend.\n\nLead Generation Business. The ability of a brokerage, whether company owned or franchised, to provide its independent sales agents with high-quality leads is increasingly important to the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and sales agent teams and the attraction and retention of franchisees. Numerous companies that market and sell residential real estate leads to independent sales agents, including listing aggregators, compete with our real estate benefit programs and other lead generation programs.\n\nTitle Agency Business. The title, escrow and settlement services business is highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country our title agency business competes with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management companies.\n\nIntegrated Services. Increasingly residential real estate market participants have sought to establish more integrated business models that include the provision of additional services to the consumer, such as title agency, mortgage origination and homeowner's insurance. Similarly, certain mortgage origination providers seek to broaden their access to the profit pools surrounding the residential real estate transaction, including real estate brokerage commissions. Some mortgage companies have created their own agent networks and may expand further into real estate. These factors have resulted in additional competitive pressure to our individual business units as well as the Company as a whole.\n\nFor additional information on the competitive risks facing our businesses, see \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Strategic & Operational Risks\", in particular under the caption \"The businesses in which we, our joint ventures, and our franchisees operate are intensely competitive and we may not be able to effectively compete.\"\n\nGovernment and Other Regulations \n\nSee Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on the Company's legal proceedings. For additional information with respect to related risks facing our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" in particular under the heading \"Regulatory and Legal Risks\", in this Annual Report.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment. All of our businesses, as well as the businesses of our joint ventures (such as mortgage origination, title insurance underwriting, and real estate auction) and the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and subject to shifts in public policy, statutory interpretation and enforcement priorities of regulators and other government authorities as well as amendments to existing regulations and regulatory guidance. Likewise, litigation, investigations, claims and regulatory proceedings against us or other participants in the residential real estate industry or relocation industry—or against companies in other industries—may impact the Company and its affiliated franchisees when the rulings or settlements in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry or business community and may generate litigation or investigations for the Company. In addition, through our subsidiaries, employees and/or affiliated agents, we are a participant in many MLSs and a member-owner of certain non-NAR controlled MLSs. Our affiliated agents may be members of NAR and respective state and local realtor associations. The rules and policies for these organizations are also subject to change due to shifts in internal policy, regulatory developments, litigation or other legal action. Changes in the rules and policies of NAR and/or any MLSs can also be driven by changes in membership, including the entry of new industry participants, and other industry forces.\n\nFrom time to time, certain industry practices have come under federal or state scrutiny or have been the subject of litigation. The industry is currently experiencing increased scrutiny by regulators and other government offices, both on a federal and state level. Four of the more active areas in our industry have been antitrust and competition, compliance with RESPA (and similar state statutes), compliance with the TCPA (and similar state statutes) and worker classification. Other examples \n\n19\n\n\ninclude, but are not limited to, consumer protection, mortgage lending and debt collection laws, federal and state fair housing laws, various broker fiduciary duties, false or fraudulent claims laws, and state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates, environmental regulation and gifts to consumers.\n\nAntitrust, Competition and Bribery Laws. Our business is subject to antitrust and competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act and related federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. The penalties for violating antitrust and competition laws can be severe. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, dividing markets, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. For additional discussion, see \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\" and \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks\".\n\nOur international business activities, and in particular our relocation operations, must comply with applicable laws and regulations that impose sanctions on improper payments, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of other countries.\n\nMultiple Listing Services Rules. MLSs, NAR and respective state and local realtor associations each maintain rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service, that specify, among other things, how MLS data and listings may be accessed, used, and displayed on websites and mobile applications. The rules of each MLS can vary widely and are complex. \n\nRESPA. RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws, state title insurance laws, and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance, home warranty and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, title agency, lead generation, and relocation operations or the businesses of our joint ventures (including mortgage origination, title underwriting and real estate auction). In addition, with respect to many of our businesses as well as the businesses of certain of our joint ventures, RESPA and similar state laws generally require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Some state authorities have also asserted RESPA enforcement rights.\n\nRESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between title underwriters and their agents, among real estate brokers, real estate brokers and agents, and market-based fees for the provision of goods or services, including marketing services. In addition, RESPA allows for the operation of affiliated business arrangements, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met. We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA. However, expansive interpretations or aggressive enforcement of RESPA or similar state statutes by regulators and/or certain courts can raise compliance challenges. Permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly, and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. Some regulators and other parties have advanced novel and stringent interpretations of RESPA including assertions that any provision of a thing of value in a separate but contemporaneous transaction with a referral constitutes a breach of RESPA on the basis that all things of value exchanged should be deemed in exchange for the referral. Violations of RESPA or similar state statutes can lead to claims of substantial damages, which may include (but are not limited to) fines, treble damages and attorneys' fees.\n\nWe are also subject to state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers, which impacts our lead generation business.\n\nWorker Classification. Although the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations and our affiliated franchisees by seeking to reclassify licensed sales agents as employees.\n\nReal estate laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors. Federal and state agencies have their own rules and tests for classification of independent contractors as well as to determine whether employees meet exemptions from minimum wages and overtime laws. These tests consider many factors that also vary from state to state. The tests continue to evolve based on state case law decisions, regulations and legislative changes.\n\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations. To run our business, it is essential for us to collect, store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, independent agents, and relocation transferees in \n\n20\n\n\nour systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. For example, in the U.S., we are required to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information, as well as state statutes governing privacy and cybersecurity matters like the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and the New York Department of Financial Services (\"NYDFS\") Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nThe CCPA imposes comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect, sell and disclose personal information about California residents and employees. In November 2020, California passed Proposition 24, establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which took effect January 1, 2023. The CPRA provides further requirements that will impact our businesses’ compliance efforts and operational risks as the CPRA differentiates “personal information” and “sensitive information,” expands the term “sale” to include sharing of personal information, and imposes data minimization and data retention requirements. The CPRA also established the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is intended to take a more active role in enforcement of the law. As of January 2025, 19 states enacted their own privacy legislation which is effective or will become effective within a year, more than doubling the number of states requiring businesses to comply with privacy obligations and the number of individuals who will have privacy rights with respect to their personal information. \n\nUnder the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation, regulated financial institutions, including Title Group, are required to establish and attest to a detailed cybersecurity program. Other state regulatory agencies have or are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation.\n\nInternationally, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") has conferred significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents) and materially increased penalties for violations. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, one of the methods for transfers of personal data into the U.S. As a result, companies may have to rely on standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules for the transfer of personal data while awaiting further guidance or regulation. In 2021, the European Commission issued an implementing decision regarding the use of Standard Contractual Clauses. In 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Other countries have also recently expanded on their data privacy laws and regulations. \n\nFor additional information with respect to our cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance framework, see \"Item 1C.—Cybersecurity.\" for additional information with respect to the cybersecurity-related risks facing our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report, in particular under the caption \"Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information or litigation or claims arising from such incidents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.\"\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The TCPA restricts certain types of telemarketing calls and text messaging, and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice messages. The TCPA also established a national Do-Not-Call registry. The TCPA defines autodialing broadly and requires express written consent for certain communications to cellphones. Certain states have also adopted, or may in the future adopt, state equivalents of the TCPA. We are vulnerable to claims made by class action consumers alleging that we are liable for contacts made by franchisees and/or independent contractor real estate agents.\n\nFranchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by federal law under the jurisdiction of the FTC. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, multiple states and U.S. territories have \"franchise relationship laws\" or \"business opportunity laws\" that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements (including mandated notice or cure periods), to discriminate unfairly among franchisees, or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the franchisors. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.\n\nState Brokerage Laws. Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales \n\n21\n\n\nagents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary, and agency and statutory duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise affiliated sales agents and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses. \n\nOur company owned and franchised brokerages (and independent sales agents affiliated with such brokerages) are also required to comply with state and local laws related to dual agency (such as where the same brokerage represents both the buyer and seller of a home), and increased regulation of dual agency representation may restrict or reduce the ability of impacted brokerages to participate in certain real estate transactions.\n\nAnti-Discrimination Laws. Our company owned and franchised brokerages, and agents affiliated with such brokerages, as well as our other businesses are subject to federal and state housing laws that generally make it illegal to discriminate against protected classes of individuals in housing or brokerage services. For example, the Fair Housing Act, its state and local law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, all prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, and, in some states or locales, financial capability, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or source of income. The U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\"), through the Fair Housing Testing Program, utilizes individuals who, without any bona fide intent to rent or purchase housing or enter into a mortgage loan, pose as prospective renters, buyers or borrower for the purpose of determining whether businesses are engaging in potentially unlawful housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Certain states or locales, such as New York, have or are in the process of expanding their laws.\n\nRegulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Nearly all states license and regulate title agencies, escrow companies and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent and/or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States may periodically lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States may also require title agencies, escrow companies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital.\n\nCertain states in which we operate have \"controlled business\" statutes which impose limitations on the percentage of business our title and escrow companies can receive from its affiliated real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit, we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. \"Controlled business\" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, or are under common control with, the title agent. Pursuant to regulations in New York, title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain and be open for title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. The Company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the payment of fines and penalties or the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title, escrow and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable \"controlled business\" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control.\n\nRegulation of the Mortgage Industry. We participate in the mortgage origination business through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Private mortgage lenders operating in the U.S. are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation and to significant oversight by government sponsored entities. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation. As we do not own any real property of significance, we are not currently materially impacted by environmental regulations. However, in recent years, an increasing number of state and federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that require new climate/environmental-related disclosures, including, for example, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (CCDAA) and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (CRFRA)—together, the California Climate Accountability Package—enacted by California in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would require us to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks by 2026.\n\n22\n\n\nItem 1A.  Risk Factors.\n\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our Company and our common stock. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. Please be advised that past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in the future.\n\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nThe residential real estate market is cyclical and we are negatively impacted by downturns and disruptions in this market.\n\nThe residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic and residential real estate conditions which are beyond our control. The significant declines experienced in the U.S. residential real estate market since mid-2022 have materially negatively impacted our financial results. If the residential real estate market does not improve or worsens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business, invest in strategic initiatives, reduce indebtedness, return capital to stockholders and motivate, attract and retain our employees.\n\nAny of the following factors related to the real estate industry could negatively impact the housing market and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing a lack of sustained improvement or a decline in the number of homesales and/or stagnant or declining home prices, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenues and profitability:\n\n•prolonged periods of a high mortgage rate environment;\n\n•high rates of inflation;\n\n•continued or accelerated reductions in housing affordability;\n\n•continued or accelerated increases in the costs of home ownership, including but not limited to rising or high insurance costs and/or challenges in securing homeowners insurance, especially in areas affected by the increasing frequency and severity of weather events and natural disasters, and increases in other expenses, fees and taxes, including maintenance and association fees;\n\n•insufficient or excessive home inventory levels by market or price point;\n\n•the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation;\n\n•decreasing consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market;\n\n•an increase in potential homebuyers with low credit ratings or inability to afford down payments;\n\n•stringent mortgage standards, reduced availability of mortgage financing or increasing down payment requirements or other mortgage challenges;\n\n•an increase in foreclosure activity;\n\n•legislative or regulatory changes (including changes in regulatory interpretations or enforcement practices) - or industry changes driven by other market participants - that would adversely impact the residential real estate market;\n\n•federal, state and/or local income tax changes and other tax reform affecting real estate and/or real estate transactions;\n\n•decelerated or lack of building of new housing for homesales or increased building of new rental properties;\n\n•irregular timing of new development closings leading to lower unit sales at Owned Brokerage Group; and\n\n•changes in consumer preferences in the U.S., including declines in consumer demand, declines in home ownership levels, and homeowners retaining their homes for longer periods of time.\n\nWe are negatively impacted by adverse developments or the absence of sustained improvement in macroeconomic conditions (such as business, economic or political conditions) on a global, domestic or local basis.\n\nOur business and operations and those of our franchisees are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide. Contraction in the U.S. economy, including the impact of recessions, slow economic growth, or a deterioration in other economic factors such as potential consumer, business or governmental defaults or delinquencies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A deterioration in economic factors that particularly impact the residential real estate market and the business segments in which we operate, \n\n23\n\n\nwhether broadly or by geography and price segments, have and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results, which may be material. \n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to: short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, rate of wage growth, consumer confidence, rate of economic growth or contraction, uncertainty in the U.S. economy (including with respect to rising U.S. government debt levels), U.S. fiscal policy (including government spending and tax reform) and related matters (such as debt ceiling negotiations and the potential or actual shutdown of the U.S. government due to a failure to enact debt ceiling legislation), and the general condition of the U.S. and the world economy. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic environment. Weak capital, credit and financial markets, instability of financial institutions, and/or the lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nA host of factors beyond our control could cause fluctuations in these conditions or otherwise result in economic instability, supply chain disruptions and affect the global or US economy, including the political environment, U.S. immigration policies, disruptions in a major geoeconomic region (such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East), changes in equity or commodity markets, acts or threats of war or terrorism or sustained pervasive civil unrest, other geopolitical or economic instability, pandemics, material natural disasters, and tariffs, and any of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, new government policies on tariffs and immigration could raise the costs of and reduce construction of new housing, thereby further aggravating existing inventory shortages and affordability concerns.\n\nIncreasing or sustained high mortgage rates have resulted, and may continue to result, in declines in homesale transactions as well as declines in title, mortgage and refinancing activity.\n\nOur business is significantly affected by the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. These policies regulate the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and impact the real estate market through their effect on interest rates (and mortgage rates) as well as the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The Federal Reserve took aggressive action intended to control inflation in 2022 and 2023, including raising the target federal funds rate and reducing its holdings of mortgage-backed securities. While the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by a total of 100 basis points in 2024, mortgage rates have remained relatively high. Rising or high interest rates generally contribute to rising or high mortgage rates, which can lead to declines in residential real estate homesale transaction volume (as evidenced by the significant volume declines in the past two years), or to homebuilders discontinuing or delaying new projects, which could further contribute to inventory constraints and to inventory shortages as homeowners retain their homes for longer periods due to high mortgage rates.\n\nThe high interest rate environment has negatively impacted and, until the interest rate environment meaningfully improves, is expected to continue to negatively impact multiple aspects of our business, as increases in mortgage rates (as well as prolonged periods of high mortgage rates) generally have an adverse impact on homesale transaction volume, housing affordability, and title, mortgage and refinancing volumes. We believe the high mortgage rate environment is a key contributor to declines in residential real estate homesale transaction volume, as potential home sellers choose to stay with their lower mortgage rate rather than sell their home and pay a higher mortgage rate with the purchase of another home and potential home buyers choose to rent rather than pay higher mortgage rates. If existing homesale transactions continue to be at depressed levels or decline further (due to the high mortgage rate environment or otherwise), we would also expect to continue to experience decreased title, mortgage origination and refinancing activity.\n\nThe imposition of more stringent mortgage underwriting standards (due to changes in policy or otherwise) or a reduction in the availability of alternative mortgage products could also reduce homebuyers' ability to access the credit markets on reasonable terms and adversely affect the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes.\n\nChanges in the Federal Reserve's policies, the interest rate environment, and the mortgage market are beyond our control, are difficult to predict, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant decline in the number of homesale transactions or title, mortgage and refinancing activity due to any of the foregoing would adversely affect our financial and operating results, which may be material.\n\n24\n\n\nMeaningful decreases in average homesale brokerage commission rates have and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our financial results.\n\nThere are a variety of factors that could contribute to declines in the average homesale broker commission rate, including changes to industry rules or practices that disrupt the historical functioning of the residential real estate market (including with respect to the manner in which broker commissions are communicated, negotiated and paid, such as those resulting from the NAR Settlement discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\"), the rise of certain competitive brokerage or non-traditional competitor models, an increase in the popularity of discount brokers or other utilization of flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions as well as other competitive factors. Average homesale price and geographic mix have and could continue to contribute to declines in the average homesale broker commission rate, as higher priced homes tend to have a lower broker commission rate. \n\nThe average homesale broker commission rate for a homesale transaction is a key determinant of our profitability in Owned Brokerage Group and Franchise Group. Meaningful reductions in the average broker commission rate, including the average buy-side commission rate, have and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our revenues, earnings and financial results.\n\nSee also the below risk factor captioned “Changes to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results”.\n\nContinued erosion of our share of homesale brokerage commissions has and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our financial results.\n\nIn addition to decreases in average homesale broker commission rates, continued erosion of our share of such homesale brokerage commission income (commonly referred to as our 'split' as homesale brokerage commissions are split between the broker (Owned Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement), as a result of changes to industry rules or practices, or otherwise, could continue to negatively affect our profitability. \n\nIntense industry competition for agents combined with our strategic emphasis on the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents has placed and is expected to continue to place upward pressure on our agent commission expense. This trend has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our profitability. Other market factors, including, but not limited to, competitors with access to outside capital that pursue increases in market share over profitability, models that operate at lower margins, including virtual brokerages and brokerages that operate in a more virtual fashion or reduced cost platforms, and listing aggregator concentration, market power and expansion into new ancillary products and services and leveraging their market power to channel consumers into those products and services, are expected to further erode our share of homesale brokerage commission income.\n\nIf independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages are paid a higher proportion of the commissions earned on a homesale transaction or the level of commission income we receive from a homesale transaction is otherwise reduced, the operating margins of our company owned residential brokerages could continue to be adversely affected.\n\nOur franchisees face similar risks and continued downward pressure on the share of homesale brokerage commission income retained by our franchisees (and not split with the independent sales agents) could negatively impact our franchisees' view of our value proposition. As a result, we may fail to attract new franchisees, expiring franchisees may not renew their agreements with us, or we may be required to offer reduced royalty fee or increased incentive arrangements to new and existing franchisees, all of which have occurred from time to time, and any of which could result in a further reduction in royalty or other fees paid to us.\n\nInsufficient inventory could continue to have a negative impact on homesale transaction sides and other homesale services, including title and mortgage.\n\nOverall housing inventory levels have been a persistent industry-wide concern for years, in particular in certain highly sought-after geographies and at lower price points. Insufficient inventory levels generally have a negative impact on homesale transaction sides and can contribute to a reduction in housing affordability, which could result in some potential home buyers deferring entry into the residential real estate market. Declines in homesale sides have also had a negative impact on other homesale services, including title and mortgage. Additional inventory pressure arises from potential home sellers choosing to stay with their lower mortgage rate rather than sell their home, periods of slow or decelerated new housing construction, real estate models that purchase homes for rental use (rather than resale), and alternative competitors. \n\n25\n\n\nPotential changes to industry rules and practices could further complicate inventory constraints. For example, changes to the Clear Cooperation Policy could, among other things, reduce the availability of broadly listed properties, leading to more unlisted inventory and potentially limiting access to comprehensive housing market data.\n\nWe believe constraints in home inventory levels have contributed to a decline in homesale transaction sides and this factor may continue to have an adverse impact on the number of homesale transaction sides closed by Franchise Group and Owned Brokerage Group (and on other homesale services, including title and mortgage), which could materially adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial results. \n\nStrategic and Operational Risks\n\nOur ability to generate revenue and grow earnings is significantly dependent upon our and our franchisees' ability to attract and retain productive independent sales agents and on our ability to attract and retain franchisees.\n\nIf we and our franchisees, as applicable, are unable to successfully maintain and grow the base of productive independent sales agents, independent sales agent teams, and other agent-facing talent at our company owned and franchisee brokerages (or if we or they fail to replace departing successful sales agents with similarly productive sales agents) or if we are unable to grow our base of franchisees, we may be unable to maintain or grow revenues or earnings and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nA variety of factors impact our ability to attract and retain independent sales agents and franchisees, including but not limited to, intense competition from other brokerages as well as companies employing technologies or alternative models intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models; our ability to develop and deliver compelling products and services to independent sales agents and franchisees; our ability to generate high-quality leads to independent sales agents and franchisees; and our ability to adopt and implement commission plans (or pricing model structures) that are attractive to such agents (or such franchisees). Changes to industry rules or practices that reduce the percentage of home buyers or home sellers using an agent or broker in their homesale transactions or change the broker commission structure, which could arise from litigation and injunctive relief, regulatory or governmental actions, market forces, changing competitive dynamics or consumer preferences, locally or industry-wide, could also reduce the overall number of independent sales agents in the industry and further increase competition for productive independent sales agents. \n\nOur franchisees face the same challenges with respect to productive sales agent recruitment and retention as well as other market pressures generally facing the industry (such as margin compression). When a franchisee is unable to maintain or grow their affiliated sales agent base, the homesale transaction volume generated by such franchisee is more likely to decline. Such declines have and could continue to result in a decline in our royalty revenues, which could be material. In addition, franchisees have and may continue to seek lower royalty rates or higher incentives from us to moderate market pressures. Such pressures also induce certain franchisees to exit our franchisee system from time to time. If franchisees, in particular multiple larger franchisees, fail to renew their franchise agreements (or otherwise leave our franchise system), or if we induce franchisees to renew these agreements through lower royalty rates or higher incentives (as we have done from time to time), then our royalty revenues may decrease, and profitability may be lower than in the past. \n\nIf we fail to successfully enhance our value proposition, we may fail to attract new or retain productive independent sales agents or franchisees, resulting in a reduction in commission income and royalty fees paid to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we are successful in our recruitment and retention efforts, any additional revenue generated may not offset the related expenses we incur. \n\nWe may not successfully develop or procure products, services and technology that support our strategic initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to continuously develop and improve, or procure, products, services, and technologies that are compelling to independent sales agents, franchisees and consumers. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of our company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop product, service and technology offerings to meet their needs as well as those that will further complement our businesses. We will continue to prioritize certain offerings over others and our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on opportunities that could later prove to have greater commercial potential.\n\nWe may incur unforeseen expenses in the development or procurement of, or enhancements to, products, services and technology, or may experience competitive delays in introducing new offerings as quickly as we would like. We also rely on third parties for the provision or development of certain key products that we offer to affiliated independent sales agents and \n\n26\n\n\nbrokers. Delays or other issues with such products could have a negative impact on our recruitment and retention efforts, which may be material. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry for technology talent may impact our ability to attract and retain employees involved in developing our technology products and services.\n\nFurthermore, the investment and pace of technology development continue to accelerate across the industry, creating risk in the relative timing and attractiveness of our technology products and services, and there can be no assurance that the targeted end user will choose to use the products, services or technologies we may develop or that they will find such products, services and technologies compelling. We may be unable to maintain and scale the technology underlying our offerings, which could negatively impact the security and availability of our services and technologies. In addition, our competitors may develop or make available products, services or technologies that are preferred by agents, franchisees and/or consumers. Further, third parties utilizing our platform may not create tools that meet the needs of agents and franchisees in a timely or effective manner, or at all.\n\nIn addition, we have made and may continue to make strategic investments in companies and joint ventures developing products, services and technologies that we believe will support our strategy and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these investments or be able to recover our investments in such companies and joint ventures and such offerings may not become available to us or may become available to our competitors. \n\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our value proposition to affiliated agents and franchisees, the productivity of independent sales agents, our appeal to consumers, or our ability to capture increased economics associated with homesale transactions, which in turn could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads for affiliated independent sales agents and franchisees, which could materially adversely impact our revenues and profitability. \n\nA key component of our long-term strategy is focused on providing affiliated independent sales agents and franchisees with high-quality leads. We expect that significant time and effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of, and consumer participation in, partner programs or products and services that are intended to aid in lead generation. Even if we are successful in these efforts, such partner programs or products may not generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads, which could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain independent sales agents and attract and retain new franchisees and could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability, including as a result of the loss of downstream revenues at our franchise, brokerage and title businesses as well as our minority-owned mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures. In addition, our lead generation business is highly regulated, subject to complex federal and state laws (including RESPA and similar state laws as well as state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers), and subject to changing economic and political influences as well as changing industry rules and practices. A change in such laws, more restrictive interpretations of such laws by administrative, legislative or other governmental bodies, or changes to industry rules or practices that may result in leads being less valuable could have a material adverse effect on this business. \n\nWe may be unable to achieve or maintain cost savings and other benefits from our cost-saving initiatives, including simplifying and modernizing our business.\n\nWe continue to engage in business optimization and cost-saving initiatives that focus on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the cost structure of each of the Company's businesses. These actions are designed to improve client service levels across each of the business units while enhancing the Company's profitability and incremental margins. We may not be able to achieve these improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations or cost structure and, even if achieved, any cost-savings realized may not be sufficient to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, including those related to employees and leases, or to offset continued pressure from the increasing share of homesale brokerage commission income paid to affiliated independent sales agents or other actual or potential changes to industry rules or practices. In connection with our implementation of cost-savings, simplification and modernization initiatives we may experience disruptions in our business, including with respect to agent and franchisee recruitment and retention efforts and the diversion of a significant amount of management and employee time and focus. We also may incur greater costs than currently anticipated to achieve these savings and we may not be able to maintain these cost savings and other benefits in the future. Failure to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position (including with respect to the recruitment and retention of franchisees and production independent sales agents), business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n27\n\n\nOur company-owned brokerage operations are subject to geographic and high-end real estate market risks, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group operates real estate brokerage offices located in and around large U.S. metropolitan areas where competition for independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is particularly intense. Local and regional economic conditions in these locations at times differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Owned Brokerage Group realized approximately 23% of its revenues from California, 21% from the New York metropolitan area and 13% from Florida, which in the aggregate totals approximately 57% of its revenues. Downturns in the residential real estate market or economic conditions that are concentrated in these regions (including as a result of severe weather events or natural disasters, such as the wildfires recently impacting California), or in other geographic concentration areas for us, result in declines in Owned Brokerage Group's total gross commission income and profitability that are disproportionate to the downturn experienced throughout the U.S. In addition, given the significant geographic overlap of our title, escrow and settlement services business with our company owned brokerage offices, such regional declines affecting our company owned brokerage operations generally have a disproportionate adverse effect on our title, escrow and settlement services business and mortgage origination joint venture as well. These factors have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our financial results and such impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group also has a significant concentration of transactions at the higher end of the U.S. real estate market and in high-tax states. Accordingly, the effects of certain state and local tax reform may have a deeper impact on our business. A shift in transactions from high-tax to low-tax states or in Owned Brokerage Group's mix of property transactions from high range to lower and middle range homes would adversely affect the average price of Owned Brokerage Group's closed homesales. Such a shift, absent an increase in transactions, would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Due to Owned Brokerage Group's concentration in high-end real estate, its business may also be adversely impacted by capital controls imposed by foreign governments that restrict the amount of capital individual citizens may legally transfer out of their countries. In addition, Owned Brokerage Group continues to face heightened competition for both homesale transactions and high performing independent sales agents because of its prominent position in the higher end housing markets.\n\nMoreover, Owned Brokerage Group also has relationships with developers in select major cities (in particular, New York City) to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments. The irregular volume and timing of new development closings may contribute to uneven financial results and deceleration in the building of new housing may result in lower unit sales in the new development market, which has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the revenue generated by Owned Brokerage Group and our profitability.\n\nThe businesses in which we, our joint ventures, and our franchisees operate are intensely competitive and we may not be able to effectively compete.\n\nWe face intense competition in the residential real estate services business, in particular with respect to productive independent sales agent recruitment and retention. Aggressive competition for the affiliation of independent sales agents continues to make recruitment and retention efforts at both Franchise Group and Owned Brokerage Group challenging, in particular with respect to more productive sales agents and in the densely populated metropolitan areas in which we operate. The competitive environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our market share and may continue to put pressure on our and our franchisees' operating margins and financial results.\n\nCompetitive pressures for independent sales agents come from a variety of sources, including traditional brokerages as well as newer brokerage models, including discount brokerages, virtual brokerages (and other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income) as well as brokerages that provide certain services to agents and agent teams, but with branding focused on the name of the agent or agent team, rather than the brokerage brand. \n\nIncreasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed. In addition, certain types of compensation that may be appealing to independent sales agents, such as equity awards, may not be available to us at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThese competitive market factors also impact our franchisees and such franchisees have and may continue to seek reduced royalty fee arrangements or other incentives from us to offset the continued business pressures on such franchisees, which has and could continue to result in a reduction in royalty fees paid to us or other associated costs.\n\n28\n\n\nWe expect this highly competitive environment to continue and, accordingly, we and our affiliated franchisees may fail to attract and retain independent sales agents if we are unable to compete in a profitable and effective manner with a combination of continuously improved value propositions and/or commission plans that appeal to a broad base of independent sales agents.\n\nIf we or our franchisees fail to attract and retain productive independent sales agents or we or they fail to replace departing successful independent sales agents with similarly productive independent sales agents, the gross commission income generated by our company owned brokerages and franchises may decrease, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. \n\nOur franchise business is also highly competitive. Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to franchise with one of our competitors or operate as an independent broker. Competitors may offer franchisees whose franchise agreements are expiring or prospective franchisees products and services similar to ours at rates that are lower than we charge or a combination of products and services that are more attractive to the franchisee. We also face the risk that brokers may not enter into or renew franchise agreements with us for a variety of reasons, including because they believe they can compete effectively in the market without the need to license a brand of a franchisor and receive services offered by a franchisor, because competitive costs associated with agent recruitment makes affiliation with a brand economically challenging, or because they may believe that their business will be more attractive to a prospective purchaser without the existence of a franchise relationship. Additional competitive pressure is provided by regional and local franchisors as well as franchisors offering different franchise models or services.\n\nWe expect that the trend of increasing incentives will continue in the future in order to attract, retain, and help grow certain franchisees. For example, to remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees, we have taken and may continue to take actions that result in increased costs to us (such as increased sales incentives to franchisees) or decreased royalty payments to us (such as a reduction in or cap on the fees we charge our franchisees, including lower royalty rates). Taking into account competitive factors, from time to time, we have and may continue to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms. If we fail to successfully offer franchisees compelling value propositions, we may fail to attract new franchisees and expiring franchisees may not renew their agreements with us, resulting in a reduction in royalty fees paid to us. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and growth opportunities.\n\nWe and our franchisees also face substantial competition from non-traditional market participants. Competition in our related businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures is also intense. See \"Item 1.—Business—Competition\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nConsumer preferences for the home buying and selling experience may change more quickly than we can adapt our businesses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants and a growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions, including new entrants that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models, minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process, and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model.\n\nSome of these models may have less exposure to risks related to the continued rise of the sales agent's share of commission income generated by homesale transactions, as they are less reliant on agent services, or may operate under a lower cost structure, such as virtual or discount brokerages. Changes to industry rules or policies and/or the introduction of disruptive products and services may also result in an increase in the number of transactions that do not utilize the services of sales agents, including for sale by owner transactions.\n\nThe significant size of the U.S. real estate market has continued to attract outside capital investment in disruptive competitors that seek to access a portion of this market, which has and is likely to continue to contribute to the competitive environment. Meaningful gains in market share by these alternative models and/or the introduction of other industry-disruptive competitors may adversely impact our market share and reduce transaction volume for homesales as well as for other Company services if we are unable to introduce competing products and services that are more attractive to consumers in a timely manner. A loss of market share or reduction in such transaction volume may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\n\n29\n\n\nListing aggregator concentration and market power creates, and is expected to continue to create, disruption in the residential real estate brokerage industry, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions, including expanding into the brokerage business, charging significant referral fees, charging listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. These actions divert and reduce the earnings of other industry participants, including our company owned and franchised brokerages. \n\nAggregators could expand their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry including, but not limited to:\n\n•setting up competing brokerages and/or businesses, which could include the capture of property listings, directing referrals to agents and brokers that share revenue with them, or the recruitment of agents or franchisees;\n\n•continuing to expand their offerings to include products (including agent tools) and services that are a part of or related to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us;\n\n•bundling their listing services with such other offerings;\n\n•broadening and/or increasing fees for their programs that charge brokerages and/or their affiliated sales agents fees including, referral, listing, display, advertising and related fees or introducing new fees for new or existing services;\n\n•not including our or our franchisees' listings on their websites;\n\n•controlling significant inventory and agent referrals, tying referrals to use of their products, and/or engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants;\n\n•leveraging their position to compel the use of their platforms exclusively, which may include requiring disclosure of competitively sensitive information;\n\n•aggregating consumer data from their listing sites and ancillary services for competitive advantage; \n\n•establishing oppressive contract terms, including with respect to data sharing requirements; \n\n•disintermediating our relationship with affiliated franchisees and independent sales agents; and/or \n\n•disintermediating the relationship between the sales agent and the buyers and sellers of homes, including through the promotion of products or services designed to replace the role of the sales agent in both buy side and sell side transactions. \n\nSuch tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our market share, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with franchisees, independent sales agents and consumers and our franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and consumers.\n\nOur financial results are affected by the operating results of our franchisees.\n\nFranchise Group receives revenue in the form of royalties, which are based on a percentage of gross commission income earned by our franchisees. Accordingly, the financial results of Franchise Group are dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees, in particular with respect to our largest franchisees. If industry trends or economic conditions worsen or do not improve or if one or more of our top performing franchisees become less competitive or leave our franchise system, Franchise Group's financial results may worsen and our royalty revenues may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, from time to time, we have had to increase our bad debt and note reserves, including with respect to the conversion notes or other note-backed funding we extend to eligible franchisees, which are forgiven ratably generally over the term of the franchise agreement upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds. We may also have to terminate franchisees due to non-payment. Moreover, the ownership model for some larger franchisees has shifted to control by private investor groups that are more likely to have a higher proportion of debt and may have different priorities than historic franchisee owners, which increases franchisee liquidity, termination and non-renewal risks and the risk that we may have to impair some or all of the conversion notes we have extended or may extend to these franchisees, which could materially adversely affect our financial results. \n\n30\n\n\nConsolidation among our top 250 franchisees puts pressure on our ability to renew or negotiate franchise agreements with favorable terms, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our royalty revenue.\n\nA significant majority of revenue at Franchise Group is generated from our top 250 franchisees, which have grown faster than our other franchisees through organic growth and market consolidation in recent years. The growing concentration in our top 250 franchisees puts pressure on our ability to renew or negotiate franchise agreements with favorable terms, including with respect to contractual royalty rates, sales incentives and covered geographies. In addition, such concentration increases risks related to the financial health of our franchisees as well as with respect to franchisee non-renewal or termination. Operational or liquidity issues that cause any of the largest franchisees to reduce or delay royalty payments or result in notes we have advanced to such franchisee to become impaired can have a significant adverse impact on the applicable brand as well as our business results. If the amount of gross commission income generated by our top 250 franchisees continues to grow at a quicker pace relative to our other franchisees, we would expect to continue to experience pressure on our royalty revenue due to increased volume incentives, lower negotiated rates, and other incentives earned by such franchisees, all of which directly impact our royalty revenue.\n\nNegligence or intentional actions of our franchisees and their independent sales agents could harm our business.\n\nOur franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages) are independent business operators and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Our franchisees may not successfully operate a real estate brokerage business in a manner consistent with industry standards or may not affiliate with effective independent sales agents or employees. If our franchisees or their independent sales agents were to engage in negligent or intentional misconduct or provide diminished quality of service to customers, our image and reputation may suffer materially, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Negligent or improper actions involving our franchisees or master franchisees, including regarding their relationships with independent sales agents, clients and employees, have led, and may in the future also lead to direct claims against us based on theories of vicarious liability, negligence, joint operations and joint employer liability which, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.\n\nAdditionally, franchisees and their independent sales agents (including those handling properties for our relocation operations) may engage or be accused of engaging in unlawful or tortious acts or failing to make necessary disclosures under federal and state law. Such acts or the accusation of such acts could harm our brands' image, reputation and goodwill or compromise our relocation operations' relationships with clients. In addition, for certain types of claims, such as claims under antitrust laws, the sales of our franchisees are included in the calculation of liability and can materially increase the magnitude of the potential liability we may face in such actions.\n\nNegligence or intentional actions of independent sales agents engaged by our company owned brokerages could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to liability.\n\nOur company-owned brokerage operations rely on the performance of independent sales agents. If the independent sales agents were to provide lower quality services to our customers or engage in negligent or intentional misconduct, our image and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we could also be subject to litigation and regulatory claims arising out of their performance of brokerage or ancillary services, which if adversely determined, could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nWe do not own two of our brands and difficulties in the business or changes in the licensing strategy of, or disagreements or complications in our relationship with, the brand owners could disrupt our business and/or negatively reflect on the brand and the brand value.\n\nThe Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brands are owned by the companies that founded these brands. Under separate long-term license agreements, we are the exclusive party licensed to run brokerage services in residential real estate under those brands, whether through our franchisees or our company owned operations. Our future operations and performance with respect to these brands requires the successful protection of those brands. Any disagreements or complications in our relationship with, or difficulties in the business or changes in the licensing strategy of, the brand owners could disrupt our business and/or negatively reflect on the brand and the brand value. For additional information see \"Item 1.—Business—Franchise Group—Intellectual Property\".\n\n31\n\n\nContinued reductions in the global spending on relocation services or a cessation or reduction in the volume of business generated from multiple significant relocation clients, or the loss of our largest real estate benefit program client could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\nMany of the general residential housing trends impacting our businesses that derive revenue from homesales also impact our relocation services business. Additionally, global corporate spending on relocation services has continued to shift to lower cost relocation benefits. Even if general residential housing trends begin to improve, spending on relocation services may not return to former levels, which would negatively impact the revenue and operating results of our relocation operations.\n\nContracts with our real estate benefit program clients and relocation clients are generally terminable at any time at the option of the client, do not require such client to maintain any level of business with us and are non-exclusive. Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated. If our largest real estate benefit program client or multiple significant relocation clients ceased or materially reduced volume under their contract with us, our revenue (including downstream revenue at Franchise, Owned Brokerage and Title Groups) and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\n\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information or litigation or claims arising from such incidents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations. \n\nWe face growing risks and costs related to cybersecurity threats to our operations, our data and customer, franchisee, employee and independent sales agent data, including but not limited to:\n\n•the failure or significant disruption of our operations from various causes, including human error, computer malware, ransomware, insecure software, zero-day threats, threats to or disruption of joint venture partners or of third-party vendors who provide critical services, or other events related to our critical information technologies and systems;\n\n•the increasing level and sophistication of cybersecurity attacks, including distributed denial of service attacks, data theft, fraud or malicious or negligent acts on the part of trusted insiders, social engineering, or other unlawful tactics aimed at compromising the systems and data of our businesses, officers, employees, franchisees and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and their customers (including via systems not directly controlled by us, such as those maintained by our franchisees, affiliated independent sales agents, joint venture partners and third party service providers, including our third-party relocation service providers); and\n\n•the reputational, business continuity and financial risks associated with a loss of data or material data breach (including unauthorized access to, or destruction or corruption of, our proprietary business information or personal information of our customers, employees and independent sales agents), the transmission of computer malware, cyberattacks, or the diversion of homesale transaction closing funds.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers, our franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and our relocation operations collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients as well as personal information, sensitive financial information and other confidential information of our employees, customers and the customers of our franchisee and company owned brokerage sales agents.\n\nThird parties, including vendors or suppliers that provide essential services for our global operations, could also be a source of security risk to us if they experience a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. We increasingly rely on third-party data processing, storage providers, and critical infrastructure services, including but not limited to cloud solution providers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and with respect to information collected and stored by our third-party service providers, we are reliant upon their security procedures, which may not be as substantial as our own procedures. A breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked.\n\nMoreover, the real estate industry is actively targeted by cyber-attacker attempts to conduct electronic fraudulent activity directed at participants in real estate services transactions. These attacks, when successful, can result in fraud, including wire fraud related to the diversion of home sale transaction funds, or other harm, which could result in significant claims and reputational damage to us, our brands, franchisees, and independent sales agents and could also result in material increases in our operational costs. Further, these threats to our business may be wholly or partially beyond our control as our franchisees as well as our customers, franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and their customers, joint venture partners and third-party service providers may use e-mail, computers, smartphones and other devices and systems that are outside of our security control environment. In addition, real estate transactions involve the transmission of funds by the buyers and sellers of real estate, and consumers or other service providers selected by the \n\n32\n\n\nconsumer may be the subject of direct cyber-attacks that result in the fraudulent diversion of funds, notwithstanding efforts we have taken to educate consumers with respect to these risks.\n\nCybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could result in, among other things, the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical systems, data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personal information and financial information) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include regulatory violations of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, reputational damage, loss of market value, litigation with third parties (which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability), diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs (that may include liability for stolen assets or information), which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness and results of operations.\n\nOur security systems and IT infrastructure may not adequately protect against all potential security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other unauthorized access to personal information, including ransomware incidents. We, our third-party service providers, franchisees, franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents, and joint venture partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents. Cyberattacks have led and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, investigating, mitigating, insuring against and remediating these incidents and risks, as well as any related attempted or actual fraud. Our corporate errors and omissions and cybersecurity breach insurance, or that of applicable third parties, may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\n\nMoreover, we are required to comply with growing laws and regulations both in the United States and in other countries where we do business that regulate cybersecurity, privacy and related matters. With an increased percentage of our business occurring virtually, there is an increased risk of a potential violation of these expanding laws and regulations. Any significant violations of such laws and regulations could result in the loss of new or existing business, litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines and/or penalties (which may not be covered by cybersecurity breach insurance) and damage to our reputation. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nThe failure of third-party vendors or partners could result in harm to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe engage with third-party vendors and partners in a variety of ways, ranging from strategic collaborations and joint ventures and product development to running key internal operational processes and critical client systems. In many instances, these third parties are in direct contact with our customers, independent sales agents and franchisees in order to deliver services on our behalf or to fulfill their role in the applicable collaboration. In some instances, these third parties may be in possession of personal information of our customers or employees. In other instances, these third parties may play a critical role in developing products and services central to our business strategy. For example, we have partnered with a strategic third party to provide our product suite to affiliated agents, brokerages and franchisees, and these products form an important part of our value proposition to such parties. In addition, we have engaged with another strategic third-party partner on key software development projects and have other strategic projects in place with other third parties. Our third-party vendors and partners may encounter difficulties in the provision of required deliverables or may fail to provide us with timely services, which may delay our projects, and also may make decisions that may harm us or that are contrary to our best interests, including by pursuing opportunities outside of the applicable Company project or program, to the detriment of such project or program.\n\nIf our third-party partners or vendors were to fail to perform as we expect, fail to appropriately manage risks, provide diminished or delayed services to our customers, experience operational or liquidity concerns (whether related to market downturns or other factors), or face cybersecurity breaches of their information technology systems, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, our operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected, in particular with respect to any such failures related to the provision or development of key products. Depending on the function involved, vendor or third-party application failure or error may lead to increased costs, business disruption, distraction to management, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, effects on financial reporting, loss of customers, damage to our reputation, or litigation, regulatory claims and/or remediation costs (including claims based on theories of breach of contract, vicarious liability, negligence or failure to comply with laws and regulations). Third-party vendors and partners may also fail to maintain or keep adequate levels of insurance, which could result in a loss to us or expose us to litigation. In addition, although we have a Vendor Code of Conduct, we may be subject to the consequences of fraud, bribery, or misconduct by employees of our vendors, which could result in significant financial or reputational harm. The actions of our third-party vendors and unaffiliated third-party \n\n33\n\n\ndevelopers are beyond our control. We face the same risks with respect to subcontractors that might be engaged by our third-party vendors and partners.\n\nWe are reliant upon information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness.\n\nOur ability to leverage our technology and data scale is critical to our long-term strategy. Our business, including our ability to attract employees and independent sales agents, increasingly depends upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems (cloud solutions, mobile and otherwise) utilized for communications, marketing, productivity tools, training, lead generation, records of transactions, business records (employment, accounting, tax, etc.), procurement, call center operations and administrative systems. The operation of these technologies and systems is dependent upon third-party technologies, systems and services for which there are no assurances of continued or uninterrupted availability and support by the applicable third-party vendors on commercially reasonable terms. We also cannot assure that we will be able to continue to effectively operate and maintain our information technologies and systems. In addition, our information technologies and systems are expected to require refinements and enhancements on an ongoing basis, and we expect that advanced new technologies and systems will continue to be introduced. We may not be able to obtain such new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, and we may not be able to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future.\n\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nIn an effort to increase efficiency, improve quality, improve agent and customer experience and decrease risk, we are utilizing innovative technologies, processes and techniques, including AI, in internal business processes and in our products and services. \n\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop products and services that anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by developments in technology, including technologies based on AI, machine learning, generative AI and large language models. If we are unable to effectively utilize these technologies in our products and services, it could adversely affect our value proposition to affiliated agents and franchisees, the productivity of independent sales agents, our appeal to consumers, or our ability to capture increased economics associated with homesale transactions, which in turn could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, applicable law, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could negatively impact our cost saving initiatives, including streamlining and modernizing our business. Failure to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position (including with respect to the recruitment and retention of productive independent sales agents and franchisees), business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFinally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face an evolving regulatory landscape. These initiatives may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, industry self-regulation standards or other complications, including those associated with potential defects in the design and development of the technologies used to automate processes; misapplication of technologies; the reliance on data, rules or assumptions that may prove inadequate; information security vulnerabilities; and failure to meet customer expectations, among others. Moreover, AI may give rise to litigation risk, including potential bias, intellectual property or privacy liability. Similar risks arise in connection with the use of AI by our third-party vendors or partners. Any of these factors may cause us to experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability, new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, and to incur additional costs to resolve such issues.\n\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our existing or future joint ventures or strategic partnerships.\n\nWe have entered into several important strategic joint ventures with third party partners. In some of these joint ventures, such as Guaranteed Rate Affinity and our Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture, we hold a minority stake and, while we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest. \n\nThere are inherent risks to joint ventures, including execution risks that could arise if our strategic priorities do not align with those of our partners. There can be no assurance that such ventures (or products offered by such ventures) will be \n\n34\n\n\nsuccessful or will operate as intended. Our current or future joint venture partners may make decisions which may harm the joint venture or are contrary to our best interests, including by pursuing opportunities outside of the joint venture. Our joint ventures generally are not exclusive and our joint venture partners could expand existing relationships with competitors or pursue relationships with other competitors to our detriment.\n\nAdditionally, even when we hold a minority interest in a joint venture, improper actions by the joint venture or our joint venture partners may also lead to direct claims against us based on theories of vicarious liability, negligence, joint operations and joint employer liability, which, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our reputation and subject us to liability for their actions. \n\nEach of our existing joint ventures faces risks specific to their business as well, including regulatory changes, consumer trends and preferences and other market conditions. For example, our mortgage origination joint venture has been materially adversely affected by high mortgage interest rates, high levels of competition, decreases in operating margins and lower gain-on-sale margins. \n\nIn addition, our joint ventures or our joint venture partners could face operational or liquidity risks due to market downturns or other factors legal investigations that may arise. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our earnings and dividends from the applicable joint venture or our results of operations. \n\nFailure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all; our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations. In addition, the success of any future acquisition strategy we may pursue will depend upon our ability to fund such acquisitions given our total outstanding indebtedness, find suitable acquisition candidates on favorable terms and for target companies to find our acquisition proposals more favorable than those made by other competitors. If an acquisition or majority-held joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations (including our internal controls and compliance environment), or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\nOur liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the substantial interest expense on our debt obligations.\n\nWe are significantly encumbered by our debt obligations. As of December 31, 2024, our total debt, excluding our securitization obligations, was $2,540 million (without giving effect to outstanding letters of credit). As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and is therefore not available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, technology, discretionary principal debt repayment or open market debt repurchases, share repurchases, dividends or future business opportunities. Our liquidity position has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the substantial interest expense on our debt obligations. In addition, a portion of our interest expense arises from variable interest rate debt, and such expenses may significantly increase if interest rates increase. Risks associated with our debt obligations are heightened during industry downturns or broader recessions that decrease our revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations.\n\nOur significant indebtedness and interest obligations could prevent us from meeting our obligations under our debt instruments and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business or pursue growth opportunities, react to changes in the economy or our industry, or incur additional borrowings under our existing facilities.\n\nOur leverage could have important consequences, including the following:\n\n•it could cause us to be unable to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under our Senior Secured Credit Facility;\n\n35\n\n\n•it could cause us to be unable to meet our debt service requirements under our debt agreements or meet our other financial obligations;\n\n•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings under our existing facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility, to refinance or restructure our indebtedness, or to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\n•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have no or less debt;\n\n•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings;\n\n•it may limit our ability to repurchase shares or declare dividends;\n\n•it may limit our ability to attract acquisition candidates or to complete future acquisitions;\n\n•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business, or may cause us to be unable to invest in strategic initiatives that are important to our growth; and\n\n•it may limit our ability to motivate, attract and retain key personnel.\n\nA material decline in our ability to generate EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility, could result in our failure to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility), which would result in an event of default if we fail to remedy or avoid a default as permitted under the applicable debt arrangement. \n\nOur debt risk may also be increased as a result of competitive pressures or changes to industry rules or practices that reduce margins and free cash flow. If our EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis were to decline and/or we were to incur additional first lien senior secured debt (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility), our ability to borrow the full capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility (without refinancing secured debt into unsecured debt) could be limited as we must maintain compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Any inability to borrow sufficient funds to operate our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nRestrictive covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and indentures governing the Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes may limit the manner in which we operate.\n\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes contain, and any future indebtedness we may incur may contain, various negative covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\n•pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\n•repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\n•make loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\n•receive dividends or other payment from certain of our subsidiaries;\n\n•enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\n•create liens;\n\n•merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\n•transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and\n\n•prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness.\n\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\n\nAn event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our other material indebtedness would adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness.\n\nIf we are unable to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under the Senior Secured Credit Facility due to a material decline in our ability to generate EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) or otherwise or if we are unable to comply with other restrictive covenants under those agreements or the \n\n36\n\n\nindentures governing our Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and we fail to remedy or avoid a default as permitted under the applicable debt arrangement, there would be an \"event of default\" under such arrangement.\n\nOther events of default include, without limitation, nonpayment of principal or interest, material misrepresentations, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain material judgments, change of control, and cross-events of default on material indebtedness as well as, under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, failure to obtain an unqualified audit opinion by 90 days after the end of any fiscal year. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders:\n\n•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\n•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable;\n\n•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\n•could prevent us from making payments on the Unsecured Notes, any of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing such notes or our Apple Ridge Funding LLC securitization program.\n\nIf we were unable to repay the amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders and holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral granted to secure those debt arrangements. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure such indebtedness. If the lenders under those debt arrangements accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our other indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance or restructure such indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing our Unsecured Notes, the trustee or holders of 25% of the outstanding applicable notes could elect to declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on such notes to be due and payable. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe have substantial indebtedness that will mature (or may spring forward) in 2026 and we may not be able to refinance or restructure any such debt on terms as favorable as those of currently outstanding debt, or at all.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $403 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in 2026 (excluding our securitization obligations) and an additional $490 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility due in 2027, which may be subject to earlier springing maturity in 2026. \n\nWe consistently evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions with respect to our debt, including restructuring our debt or repaying or refinancing certain tranches of our indebtedness and extending maturities, among other potential alternatives. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations and 'most favored nation' provisions applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. The high-yield market may not be accessible to companies with our debt profile, and such or other financing alternatives may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any future indebtedness may impose various additional restrictions and covenants on us which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Refinancing or restructuring debt at a higher cost would affect our operating results. We could also issue public or private placements of our common stock or preferred stock or convertible notes, any of which could, among other things, dilute our current stockholders and materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nThe exchangeable note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock. \n\nConcurrent with the offering of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, we entered into exchangeable note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with certain counterparties (the \"Option Counterparties\"). The exchangeable note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon exchange of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of exchanged notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\n\nThe Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling the common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Exchangeable Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to an exchange of the notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\n\n37\n\n\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the exchangeable note hedge transactions. \n\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of such Option Counterparties may default under the exchangeable note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the exchangeable note hedge transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any Option Counterparty.\n\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future.\n\nOur indebtedness has been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned to us or our indebtedness will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any downgrade , suspension or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency (or any anticipated downgrade, suspension or withdrawal) as well as any actual or anticipated placement on negative outlook by a rating agency could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future.\n\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, $490 million of our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility was at variable rates of interest thereby exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.\n\nWe may be unable to continue to securitize certain of the relocation assets of Cartus, which may adversely impact our liquidity.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, $140 million of securitization obligations were outstanding through special purpose entities monetizing certain assets of Cartus under one lending facility. We have provided a performance guaranty which guarantees the obligations of Cartus and its subsidiaries, as originator and servicer under the Apple Ridge securitization program. Our significant debt obligations may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings under our existing securitization facilities. The securitization markets have experienced, and may again experience, significant disruptions, which may have the effect of increasing our cost of funding or reducing our access to these markets in the future.\n\nIn addition, the Apple Ridge securitization facility contains terms which if triggered may result in a termination or limitation of new or existing funding under the facility and/or may result in a requirement that all collections on the assets be used to pay down the amounts outstanding under such facility. If securitization financing is not available to us for any reason, we could be required to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, which would adversely impact our liquidity, or we may be required to find additional sources of funding which may be on less favorable terms or may not be available at all.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\nAdverse developments or resolutions in litigation filed against us or against affiliated agents, franchisees or our joint ventures, may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs described in Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report (\"Note 15\"), we are a party to material litigation (including certified and putative class actions) in the areas of antitrust and TCPA. While we have received the final court approval of a nationwide settlement of sell-side antitrust class action litigation it has been appealed by several parties. Our settlement agreement with respect to our TCPA litigation remains subject to preliminary and final approval of the court. In addition, the buy-side antitrust case filed against us remains outstanding as do other antitrust cases. We cannot provide any assurances that results in this litigation or other litigation in which we are or may be named will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, either individually or in the aggregate.\n\n38\n\n\nLitigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties. Even cases brought by us can involve counterclaims asserted against us and even in matters in which we are not a named party, regulatory investigations and other litigation can have significant implications for us, particularly to the extent that changes in industry rules and practices can directly impact us. In addition, litigation and other legal matters, including class action lawsuits, multi-party litigation and regulatory proceedings challenging practices that have broad impact, can be costly to defend and, depending on the class size and claims, could be costly to settle.\n\nInsurance coverage may be unavailable for certain types of claims (including antitrust and TCPA litigation) and even where available, insurance carriers may dispute coverage for various reasons (including the cost of defense). Additionally, there is a deductible for each such case and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the losses the Company incurs.\n\nLikewise, we cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of other litigation and proceedings that have been or may be filed by or against us or against affiliated independent sales agents or franchisees or our joint ventures, and adverse developments and outcomes may materially harm our business and financial condition. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, the types of matters described under Note 15.\n\nAdverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions against companies unrelated to us or the real estate industry at large could impact our business practices and those of our franchisees in a manner that adversely impacts our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn general, we and other industry participants have seen an overall increase in significant litigation and regulatory scrutiny, and adverse outcomes and injunctive relief against industry participants, including industry associations and trade groups, could have a material adverse impact on us. Litigation, investigations, claims and regulatory proceedings against other participants in the residential real estate or relocation industry may impact the Company and its affiliated franchisees when the rulings or settlements in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry or business community and may generate litigation or investigations for the Company. Examples may include RESPA, worker classification, or antitrust and anti-competition claims, among others. For example, under the NAR Settlement, NAR agreed to certain practice changes including those discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\". Similarly, the Company may be impacted by litigation and other claims against companies in other industries, including litigation involving worker classification. To the extent plaintiffs are successful in these types of litigation matters, and we or our franchisees cannot distinguish our or their practices (or our industry’s practices), we and our franchisees could face significant liability and could be required to modify certain business relationships and/or practices, either of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nAs described more fully below and \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\", we operate in a highly regulated industry. In addition, from time to time, certain industry practices have changed for a variety of reasons and may continue to evolve. For example, NAR recently agreed to certain practice changes, including among other things, prohibiting offers of compensation to buyer brokers from being made on listings on an MLS pursuant to the NAR Settlement discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\".\n\nIndustry rules and practices, particularly those that mandate behavior by industry participants, have drawn increasing scrutiny and criticism, including from various industry participants as well as regulators and other government offices, both on a federal and state level, with particular focus on antitrust and competition. There can be no assurances as to whether the DOJ or FTC, their state counterparts, state or federal courts, or other federal, state or local governmental body will determine that any industry practices or developments have an anti-competitive effect on the industry or are otherwise proscribed. Any such determination could result in industry investigations, enforcement actions, changes in legislation, regulations, interpretations or regulatory guidance or other legislative or regulatory action or other actions, any of which could have the potential to result in additional limitations or restrictions on our business, cause material disruption to our business, result in judgments, settlements, penalties or fines (which may be material), or otherwise adversely affect us. For example, we believe that based on public statements made by the DOJ in filings, the DOJ has continued to focus on the manner in which broker commissions are communicated, negotiated and paid, including how MLSs and state associations are implementing the changes required by the NAR Settlement and potentially on broader restrictions or bans on offers of compensation. The scope of the DOJ's scrutiny may also expand to other industry rules or practices. \n\n39\n\n\nRules and practices that may be subject to future change (whether instigated by industry participants or otherwise) include, but are not limited to, the Clear Cooperation Policy, the rules mandating participation in state and national Realtor associations in order to post on the local MLS, the rules limiting access to lock-boxes used to facilitate property showings, the rules that limit display of co-mingled MLS and non-MLS listings and rules related to the communication or display of transaction terms, including with respect to commissions. \n\nThe consequences of future industry changes are unknown and may be varied. For example, changes to the Clear Cooperation Policy could, among other things, reduce the availability of broadly listed properties, leading to more unlisted inventory and potentially limiting access to comprehensive housing market data. Concurrently, evolving rules may reduce MLS or other participant obligations, further fragmenting the inventory of homes available for sale and disrupting the industry’s collaborative model. There is no recent industry experience with widespread use of offline exclusives and it is difficult to predict how consumers, brokerages, agents and franchisees will respond. Among other possibilities, it could result in increased competition for productive independent sales agents, increased industry consolidation due to a need for greater listing scale, and changes in consumer marketing. All of these impacts could adversely impact our operations, revenues, earnings and financial results. \n\nWe cannot assure you that changes in legislation, regulations, interpretations or regulatory guidance, enforcement priorities, litigation or the rules and policies of NAR, any MLSs and/or any state or local realtor association (or any resulting changes to competitive dynamics or consumer preferences, either alone or in combination with any of the foregoing), will not materially adversely impact the structure of the industry or the financial results of the Company, affiliated franchisees and/or other industry participants. Such impacts could include, but are not limited to, meaningful decreases in the average broker homesale commission rate, the average buy-side commission rate, the share of commission income received by us and our franchisees, the share of royalties we receive from our franchisees, or the percentage of home buyers or home sellers using an agent or broker in their homesale transactions. Additionally, such changes could result in the introduction or growth of certain competitive models, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, earnings and financial results.\n\nOur businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures and affiliated franchisees are highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations or in the interpretations or enforcement of such regulations could adversely affect our business.\n\nAll of our businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures as well as the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and subject to shifts in public policy, statutory interpretation and enforcement priorities of regulators and other government authorities as well as amendments to existing regulations and regulatory guidance and change to MLS and/or NAR rules and policies. We must comply with numerous laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information concerning laws and regulations impacting our business, including antitrust, competition and bribery laws, RESPA, worker classification and the TCPA, among others. \n\nEach of our businesses could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations, and more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations could increase responsibilities and duties to customers and franchisees and other parties and make compliance more difficult or expensive. A change in current laws could adversely affect our business. In addition, any adverse changes in regulatory interpretations, rules and laws that would place additional limitations or restrictions on affiliated transactions could have the effect of limiting or restricting collaboration among our businesses. We cannot assure you that future changes in legislation, regulations or interpretations will not adversely affect our business operations. \n\nRegulatory authorities also have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our financial condition or our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could limit our ability to renew current franchisees or sign new franchisees or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\nOur compliance efforts may result in increased expenses, diversion of management's time or changes to the manner in which we conduct our business. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws, regulations or interpretations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business. Likewise, all of the foregoing could adversely affect the businesses of our joint ventures or franchisees. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n40\n\n\nThere may be adverse financial and operational consequences to us and our franchisees if independent sales agents are reclassified as employees.\n\nAlthough the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations, and our affiliated franchisees by seeking to reclassify licensed sales agents as employees. Certain jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting standards that are significantly more restrictive than those historically used in wage and hour cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nSignificant determinations to reclassify sales agents as employees in the absence of available exemptions from minimum wage or overtime laws, including damages and penalties for prior periods (if assessed), could be disruptive to our business, constrain our operations in certain jurisdictions and could have a material adverse effect on the operational and financial performance of the Company.\n\nIf we fail to protect the privacy and personal information of our customers or employees, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation.\n\nRegulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs as a result of numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. These ongoing changes to privacy and cybersecurity laws also may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, we are required to comply with  numerous laws governing privacy and cybersecurity matters. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations—Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nWe could also be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. These ongoing changes to privacy and cybersecurity laws also may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\nAny significant violations of privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations (including those involving joint ventures or our third-party vendors or partners) could result in the loss of new or existing business (including potential home buyers or sellers, our corporate relocation or real estate benefit program clients, their employees or members, franchisees, independent sales agents and lender channel clients), litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines, damages, and penalties and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. With an increased percentage of our business occurring virtually, there is an enhanced risk of a potential violation of the expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, while we disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, customer expectations or state, national and international regulations.\n\nThe occurrence of a significant claim in excess of our insurance coverage in any given period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations during the period.\n\nThe weakening or unavailability of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including through the loss of intellectual property we license.\n\nOur trademarks, trade names, domain names and other intellectual property rights are fundamental to our brands and our franchising business. The steps we take to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate and, in particular, we may not own all necessary registrations for our intellectual property. Applications we have filed to register our intellectual property may not be approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property rights without our authorization or independently developing \n\n41\n\n\ntechnology that is similar to ours. Also, third parties may own rights in similar trademarks. Any unauthorized or improper use of our intellectual property by third parties, including current or formerly affiliated franchisees or independent sales agents, could reduce our competitive advantages or otherwise harm our business and brands. If we had to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be costly, and we may not prevail. Our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may update intellectual property used in our business, which creates transition and increased expense.\n\nWe cannot be certain that our intellectual property does not and will not infringe issued intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation. Adverse outcomes in intellectual property litigation and proceedings could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of intellectual property that is subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights. We may be required to enter into licensing or consent agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all), or to pay damages or royalties or cease using certain service marks, trademarks, technology or other intellectual property.\n\nWe franchise our brands to franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our brands or our reputation. In addition, our license agreements for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brands are terminable by the respective licensor prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur and the loss of either of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nOther Business Risks\n\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.\n\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations (due to the risks reflected in this Annual Report or otherwise), we could incur impairment charges in the past (including as related to management's estimates with respect to the potential impact of the ongoing housing market downturn on our business), which would negatively impact our earnings. We have recognized significant non-cash impairment charges and we may be required to take additional such charges in the future, which may be material.\n\nWe could be subject to significant losses if banks do not honor our escrow and trust deposits.\n\nOur company owned brokerage business and our title, escrow and settlement services business act as escrow agents for numerous customers. As an escrow agent, we receive money from customers to hold until certain conditions are satisfied. Upon the satisfaction of those conditions, we release the money to the appropriate party. We deposit this money with various banks and while these deposits are not assets of the Company (and therefore excluded from our consolidated balance sheet), we remain contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits. These escrow and trust deposits totaled $518 million at December 31, 2024. The banks may hold a significant amount of these deposits in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit. If any of our depository banks were to become unable to honor any portion of our deposits, customers could seek to hold us responsible for such amounts and, if the customers prevailed in their claims, we could be subject to significant losses.\n\nChanges in accounting standards, subjective assumptions and estimates used by management related to complex accounting matters could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidance and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters, such as revenue recognition, lease accounting, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, valuation reserves, income taxes and fair value accounting, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management. Changes in these rules or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments made by management could significantly change our reported results.\n\n42\n\n\nOur international operations are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\n\nOur relocation services business operates worldwide and we have other international operations and relationships, including but not limited to international franchisees and master franchisees. Such operations and relationships are subject to risks that are not generally experienced by our U.S. operations and could result in losses against which we are not insured and have a negative impact on our profitability. Such risks include, but are not limited to, heightened exposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations (including those related to employees, privacy and data storage, and other compliance issues, including sanction programs), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and potential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S. In addition, the activities of franchisees and master franchisees outside of the U.S. are more difficult and more expensive to monitor and improper activities or mismanagement may be more difficult to detect.\n\nLoss or attrition among our senior executives or other key employees and our inability to develop our existing workforce and to recruit top talent could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees, our ability to develop the skills and talent of our workforce and our ability to recruit, retain and motivate top talent. Talent management has been and continues to be a strategic priority and our ability to recruit and retain our executive officers and key employees, including those with expertise in enterprise-wide transformation and relevant product and technology capabilities, is subject to numerous factors, including the compensation and benefits we pay. Our recruitment and retention efforts may be hindered by present or future restructurings or cost savings initiatives. The ongoing downturn in the real estate market and the uncertainties surrounding how the industry may evolve due to litigation and/or regulatory action may restrict our ability to offer competitive compensation which, in addition to the broader uncertainty and potential downsides in the broader real estate market, could hinder our recruitment and retention efforts or make it more difficult to motivate our existing employees. The increasing prevalence of virtual and remote-work arrangements adds additional competition for critical talent. Additionally, the advancement of federal or state laws or regulations seeking to prohibit or limit the use of non-compete clauses with workers could have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to internally develop or hire skilled executives and other critical positions, successfully plan for succession of employees holding key management positions, or if we encounter challenges associated with change management or the competitiveness of compensation actually realized by our executive officers and other key employees, our ability to continue to execute or evolve our strategy may be impaired and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nSevere weather events or natural or man-made disasters, including increasing severity or frequency of such events, or other catastrophic events (including public health crises) may disrupt our business and have an unfavorable impact on homesale activity and the activity levels of other Company services.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group has a significant concentration of offices and transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the U.S. real estate market, particularly the east and west coasts. Coastal areas, including California and Florida, are particularly subject to severe weather events (including hurricanes and flooding) and natural disasters. Increasingly, wildfires in the west have been difficult to contain and cover large areas. For example, in early 2025, California experienced significant wildfires. We are monitoring potential effects on the impacted markets and will continue to support our independent sales agents, franchisees and consumers.\n\nThe occurrence of a severe weather event or natural or man-made disaster can reduce the level and quality of home inventory and negatively impact the demand for homes in affected areas, which can disrupt local or regional real estate markets, delay the closing of homesale transactions and have an unfavorable impact on home prices, homesale transaction volume, relocation transactions, and title closing units. These effects may be compounded when the taxes or insurance costs associated with homeownership in the affected area are higher than average or the cost of such insurance materially increases in connect with the increasing frequency and severity of weather events or other disasters. Movements away from the use of title insurance in connection with rising affordability concerns could lead to declines in certain services offered by the Company or its joint venture operations.\n\nIn addition, we could incur damage, which may be significant, to our office locations as a result of severe weather events or natural disasters, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover such losses. More frequent and/or severe weather events and/or long-term shifts in climate patterns exacerbate these risks. Likewise, our business and operating results could suffer as the result of other catastrophic events, including public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. For example, the COVID-19 crisis contributed to material reductions in relocation volume and significant homesale transaction volume volatility in 2021. \n\n43\n\n\nIncreasing governmental regulation and scrutiny from investors, customers and regulators with respect to corporate sustainability practices and reporting may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing focus from certain investors, regulators and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. State and federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that expand mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as emissions and environmental/climate-related topics, human capital, labor and risk oversight, which could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, California enacted the California Climate Accountability Package, which is the first U.S. law to require certain companies with California operations to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks. Existing and proposed ESG-related regulations may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\n\nSome investors may use ESG factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our related policies are inadequate. In addition, certain relocation clients have required that we implement certain additional ESG procedures or standards in order to continue to do business with us and additional clients may impose such requirements in the future. Meeting these evolving expectations could be costly and failure (or perceived failure) to satisfy investor, client, consumer or other stakeholder expectations and standards, could also cause reputational harm to our business and brands.\n\nIn addition, we may face increased scrutiny related to any actions or positions we could be viewed as taking in this space.  We could be subjected to negative responses (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) by either proponents or detractors of any particular ESG-related topic, including activists and consumers, which could adversely affect our reputation and business.\n\nMarket forecasts and estimates, including our internal estimates, may prove to be inaccurate and, even if achieved, our business could fail to grow at similar rates.\n\nWe use forecasts and data from a wide variety of industry sources (including NAR, Fannie Mae and other independent sources) in addition to good faith estimates derived from management's knowledge of the industry to inform our own forecasts and estimates for key market trends. Forecasts regarding rates of home ownership, median sales price, volume of homesales, and other housing industry metrics are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ. Even if the markets in which we compete achieve the growth forecasted by an industry source like NAR or Fannie Mae, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. \n\nWe may incur substantial liabilities arising out of our legacy pension plan.\n\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan for which participation was frozen as of July 1, 1997; however, the plan is subject to minimum funding requirements. Although the Company to date has met its minimum funding requirements, the pension plan represents a liability on our balance sheet and will continue to require cash contributions from us, which may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. In addition, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our pension plan and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plan.\n\nWe are responsible for certain of Cendant's contingent and other corporate liabilities.\n\nAlthough we have resolved various Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities and have established reserves for most of the remaining unresolved claims of which we have knowledge, adverse outcomes from the unresolved Cendant liabilities for which Anywhere Group has assumed partial liability under the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of July 27, 2006 among Cendant, Anywhere Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport could be material with respect to our earnings or cash flows in any given reporting period.\n\n44\n\n\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\n\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\nThe market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, many of which are outside our control, including, but not limited to, those described above and the following:\n\n•our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\n•our business and/or financial guidance, any revisions to such guidance and/or failure to achieve results consistent with such guidance;\n\n•our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\n•future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market;\n\n•the incurrence of additional indebtedness or other adverse changes relating to our debt;\n\n•commencement of new, or adverse resolution of or developments in, legal or regulatory proceedings against the Company or the industry; \n\n•the public's reaction to announcements concerning our business or our competitors' businesses;\n\n•changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts covering our stock or if securities analysts cease publishing or publish unfavorable research about our business;\n\n•ratings changes or commentary by rating agencies on our debt;\n\n•press releases or other commentary by industry forecasters or other housing market participants;\n\n•market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy;\n\n•actual or potential changes in laws, regulations and legal and regulatory interpretations;\n\n•changes to industry rules or practices that actually or may potentially adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market;\n\n•changes in housing or mortgage finance markets or other housing fundamentals, including changes in interest and mortgage rates;\n\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\n•arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\n•actions of current or prospective stockholders (including activists or several top stockholders acting alone or together) that may cause temporary or speculative market perceptions, including market rumors and short selling activity in our stock; and\n\n•changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets.\n\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall or experience volatility and may expose us to litigation, including class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\n\nDelaware law and our organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\n\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\n•do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\n•delegate the sole power to a majority of the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;\n\n•provide the power to our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\n•authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\n•eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\n•prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\n45\n\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\n\nThe foregoing factors could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock and our investors' ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.\n\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\n\nItem 1C.  Cybersecurity.\n\nThe Board of Directors (\"Board\") and management believe that cybersecurity is vital to protecting proprietary and confidential information, company operations and maintaining the trust of our customers, agents, franchisees, and employees. The Company has a cybersecurity risk management strategy and a governance framework to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. As discussed below, the Company utilizes both internal and external resources as part of its cybersecurity program.\n\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nAnywhere views its cybersecurity strategy through a multi-pronged lens encompassing prevention, detection and response to ensure holistic coverage of the program and our environments. \n\nPrevention. Our cybersecurity program starts with prevention, which includes risk assessment and identification and utilizing that information to design an effective layer of controls as a baseline.\n\nOur cybersecurity program includes risk assessment and identification processes that are aligned with our overall enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") program. As part of the annual integrated risk assessment process, the cybersecurity team works with our ERM, internal audit and legal compliance functions to assess and identify cybersecurity and related risks to our business. These risks are then included, as appropriate, in the updated ERM profile, and with top risks being addressed in the cybersecurity yearly plan. As part of that process, we utilize both internal and third-party resources to identify risks. In addition, Internal Audit regularly conducts operational audits of the cybersecurity processes. \n\nIn evaluating the risks posed by third parties, our cybersecurity program also includes a dedicated function for Third Party Risk Management, that oversees the identification and mitigation of risk associated with outsourcing to third party vendors and service providers, particularly focused on vendors who process personal information, intellectual property, or other sensitive information. \n\nFinally, with regard to compliance risk, we utilize third party firms to help us determine compliance with industry standards and regulations. We also maintain a Data Privacy Steering Committee, which is a group of internal legal, risk and IT professionals, to assist management with fulfilling applicable data privacy regulations. \n\nIn order to protect our assets, we utilize a multi-layer defense strategy to control who logs on to our network and uses our computers and other devices. We have enforced multi-factor authentication, implemented firewalls, and deployed a VPN alternative solution that delivers a zero trust model for access to our network and resources. We also protect our data through our use of security software, which is regularly updated, encryption of sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, and by conducting regular data backups. We have formal policies for safely disposing of electronic files and old devices and we train all employees annually on cybersecurity and their crucial role in protecting the Company’s assets.\n\nDetection. Our cybersecurity program includes tools and processes designed to detect breaches and other cybersecurity incidents as well as unauthorized access and unusual network activity. We utilize a security operations program with 24/7 monitoring by both internal and third parties that includes a variety of detection tools. We also utilize backstop detection and preventative measures, like malware detection.\n\nResponse. Our Cyber Security Incident Response Plan (the “Response Plan”) provides the methodology used by the Company to identify and respond to cyber security incidents. The Response Plan serves as a guide to facilitate a consistent and systematic response to cyber security incidents and is designed to (a) prevent or minimize disruption of critical information systems; (b) minimize loss or theft of sensitive information and/or funds; (c) quickly and efficiently remediate, report (including any public or internal company communications or required reporting) and recover from cyber security incidents; and (d) provide a centralized enterprise investigations process. The Response Plan also provides for incorporating lessons learned after an event to prevent future breaches of the same nature. \n\nWe utilize internal and external resources to evaluate the effectiveness and maturity of our cybersecurity program. We conduct regular penetration and vulnerability testing. We conduct annual tabletop exercises to test and iterate our Response Plan, while also providing training for the Response Plan working group. In addition, we conduct compliance training and regular phishing assessments for our employees.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, no known cybersecurity threats have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. The cybersecurity risks that could materially affect Anywhere, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, are set forth in “Item 1A.—Risk Factors”.\n\nGovernance\n\nEffective risk management is critical to Anywhere’s ability to achieve its strategy. The Board oversees management in exercising its responsibility for managing risk, considering our framework of policies, procedures, and processes to anticipate, identify, assess, prioritize, and mitigate risks across the Company. \n\nOur Audit Committee shares oversight responsibility with the full Board for our information security and technology risks, including cybersecurity. Anywhere’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and once a year to the full Board on the cybersecurity program, including the Company’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s information security systems, assessments of the Company’s security program and the emerging threat landscape. Two Audit Committee members have significant business experience with respect to cybersecurity risks, namely the chair of the committee, who oversaw information security and data privacy as an Enterprise Risk Officer of a Fortune 500 publicly-traded company and a member who, from June 2018 to March 2024, was Chief Product Data, Analytics and Technology Officer of a Fortune 500 publicly-traded company.\n\nWhile the Board and the committees oversee our risk management, our CEO and other members of senior management (including the Risk Management Committee) are primarily responsible for day-to-day risk management analysis and mitigation and report to the full Board or the relevant committee regarding risk management. We believe this division of responsibility is the most effective approach for addressing our risk management.\n\nOur CISO leads a dedicated internal Global Information Security (“GIS”) team that is responsible for leading enterprise-wide information cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes, all of which are designed to prevent, detect and respond to information security threats, as further described in “Risk Management and Strategy” above. The CISO’s experience includes more than 20 years in the security and fraud profession in multiple high-risk industries, including the critical infrastructure sector, and encompasses various cybersecurity leadership roles and almost seven years as a CISO. She is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and has a Master’s Degree in Information Systems Management.\n\nIn support of the GIS team, the CISO leads the Information Security Steering Committee, a group of internal security leadership positions that ensure alignment between the company’s information security program and company objectives. \n\nOverseeing enterprise-wide risk management is our Risk Management Committee, chaired by our General Counsel and comprised of key members of our executive management team, including the CISO. The Risk Management Committee meets regularly and plays a core role in the identification, monitoring, mitigation, and management of the risks the Company faces and oversees our enterprise risk management framework, including cybersecurity and data protection/privacy. \n\nThrough this dynamic risk assessment and governance process, the Risk Management Committee and Board consistently evaluate the risk environment and adjust the Company's risk profile, including cybersecurity and data privacy risks, and focus as needed to respond to industry and macroeconomic changes and to protect the Company.",

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\n\nThe following summary of risk factors is not exhaustive. We are subject to other risks discussed under \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors,\" and under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as risks that may be discussed in other reports filed with the SEC. As noted under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above, these factors could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Investors and other readers are urged to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating our business.\n\n•The residential real estate market is cyclical, and we are negatively impacted by downturns and disruptions in this market, including factors that impact homesale transaction volume (homesale sides times average homesale price), such as:\n\n◦prolonged periods of a high mortgage rate and/or high inflation rate environment;\n\n◦continued or accelerated reductions in housing affordability, whether at initial purchase or ongoing ownership cost; \n\n◦insufficient or excessive home inventory levels by market or price point;\n\n◦continued or accelerated declines, or the absence of significant increases, in the number of home sales;\n\n◦stagnant or declining home prices; and\n\n◦changes in consumer preferences in the U.S.; \n\n•We are negatively impacted by adverse developments or the absence of sustained improvement in macroeconomic conditions (such as business, economic or political conditions) on a global, domestic or local basis;\n\n•Changes to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market (regardless of whether such changes are driven by regulatory action, litigation outcomes, or otherwise) could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results, including, but not limited to, changes related to:\n\n◦the clear cooperation policy, which is a National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) mandated policy that requires a listing broker to submit a listing to the multiple listing services (\"MLSs\") for cooperation with other MLS participants within a specified time of marketing a property to the public (the “Clear Cooperation Policy”);\n\n◦the rules mandating participation in state and national Realtor associations in order to post on the local MLS; and\n\n◦the rules limiting access to lock-boxes used to facilitate property showings and the rules that limit display of co-mingled MLS and non-MLS listings;\n\n•Risks related to the impact of evolving competitive and consumer dynamics on both the Company and affiliated franchisees, whether driven by competitive or regulatory factors or other changes to industry rules or practices, which could include, but are not limited to:\n\n◦meaningful decreases in the average homesale broker commission rate (including the average buy-side commission rate);\n\n◦continued erosion of our share of the commission income generated by homesale transactions;\n\n◦our ability (and the ability of affiliated joint ventures and franchisees) to compete against traditional and non-traditional competitors, including those that adapt more effectively, including by growing inorganically, to the continuing downturn in the housing market and the changes in industry rules and practices; \n\n◦our ability to adapt our business to changing consumer preferences; and\n\n◦further disruption in the residential real estate brokerage industry related to listing aggregator market power and concentration, including with respect to ancillary services; \n\n•Our business and financial results may be materially and adversely impacted if we are unable to execute our business strategy, including if we are not successful in our efforts to:\n\n◦recruit and retain productive independent sales agents and teams, and other agent-facing talent;\n\n◦attract and retain franchisees or renew existing franchise agreements without reducing contractual royalty rates or increasing the amount and prevalence of sales incentives;\n\n◦develop or procure products, services and technology that support our strategic initiatives;\n\n◦successfully adopt and integrate artificial intelligence and similar technology into our products and services;\n\n◦achieve or maintain cost savings and other benefits from our cost-saving initiatives;\n\n◦generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads for independent sales agents and franchisees; and\n\n◦complete, integrate or realize the expected benefits of acquisitions and joint ventures; \n\n•Adverse developments or resolutions in litigation, in particular large scale litigation, involving significant claims, such as class action antitrust litigation and litigation related to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\n•Our substantial indebtedness, alone or in combination with other factors, particularly heightened during industry downturns or broader recessions, could (i) adversely limit our operations, including our ability to grow our business whether organically or via acquisitions, (ii) adversely impact our liquidity including, but not limited to, with respect to our interest obligations and the negative covenant restrictions contained in our debt agreements and/or (iii) adversely impact our ability, and any actions we may take, to refinance, restructure or repay our indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;\n\n•We have substantial indebtedness that will mature (or may spring forward) in 2026 and we may not be able to refinance or restructure any such debt on terms as favorable as those of currently outstanding debt, or at all;\n\n•An event of default under our material debt agreements would adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness;\n\n•A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future;\n\n•Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase;\n\n•Our financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely impacted by risks related to our business structure, including, but not limited to:\n\n◦the operating results of affiliated franchisees and their ability to pay franchise and related fees;\n\n◦continued consolidation among our top 250 franchisees;\n\n◦challenges relating to the owners of the two brands we do not own; \n\n◦the geographic and high-end market concentration of our company owned brokerages;\n\n◦the loss of our largest real estate benefit program client or continued reduction in spending on relocation services; \n\n◦the failure of third-party vendors or partners to perform as expected or our failure to adequately monitor them; \n\n◦our ability to continue to securitize certain of the relocation assets of Cartus;\n\n◦our reliance on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness; and\n\n◦the negligence or intentional actions of affiliated franchisees and their independent sales agents or independent sales agents engaged by our company owned brokerages, which are traditionally outside of our control;\n\n•Risks related to legal and regulatory matters may cause us to incur increased costs and/or result in adverse financial, operational or reputational consequences to us, including but not limited to, our failure or alleged failure to comply with laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations and any changes or stricter interpretations of any of the foregoing, including but not limited to: (1) antitrust laws and regulations, (2) the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\") or other federal or state consumer protection or similar laws, (3) state or federal employment laws or regulations that would require reclassification of independent contractor sales agents to employee status, (4) the TCPA and any related laws limiting solicitation of business, and (5) privacy or cybersecurity laws and regulations;\n\n•We face reputational, business continuity and legal and financial risks associated with cybersecurity incidents;\n\n•The weakening or unavailability of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business;\n\n•Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to further impairment which could negatively impact our earnings;\n\n•We could be subject to significant losses if banks do not honor our escrow and trust deposits;\n\n•Changes in accounting standards and management assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact on us; \n\n•We face risks related to potential attrition among our senior executives or other key employees and related to our ability to develop our existing workforce and to recruit talent in order to advance our business strategies;\n\n•We face risks related to our Exchangeable Senior Notes and exchangeable note hedge and warrant transactions;\n\n•We face risks related to severe weather events, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as the wildfires recently impacting California;\n\n•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations related to corporate sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks;\n\n•Market forecasts and estimates, including our internal estimates, may prove to be inaccurate; and\n\n•We face risks related to our common stock, including that price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\n3\n\n\nTRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS\n\nWe own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business.

Some data is also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from management’s knowledge of the industry and independent sources. While we believe that the industry data presented herein is derived from the most widely recognized sources for reporting U.S. residential housing market statistical data, we caution that such information is subject to change and do not endorse or suggest reliance on this data or information alone. For example, in 2022, NAR significantly revised its previously published average (mean) sales price (“ASP”) data for U.S. existing homes for prior periods, which resulted in discontinuing our usage of NAR ASP data in our SEC filings.\n\nForecasts regarding rates of home ownership, sales price, volume of homesales, and other metrics included in this Annual Report to describe the housing industry are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but such information may not be accurate or complete. We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Statements as to our market position are based on market data currently available to us. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding industry data provided herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon various factors, including those discussed under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements.\" Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable, even though such research has not been verified by any independent sources.\n\nIndustry Overview \n\nIndustry definition. We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:\n\n•the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 4.7 million homesales in the U.S. in 2024, NAR estimates that approximately 4.1 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 86% of the overall sales as measured in units;\n\n•existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and\n\n•we are able to generate revenues from other Company services provided to our customers.\n\nOur business model relies heavily on affiliated independent sales agents, who play a critical consumer-facing role in the home buying and selling experience for both our company owned and franchise brokerages. While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, approximately 88% of home buyers and 90% of home sellers used an agent or broker in 2024. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved \n\n6\n\n\nin most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:\n\n•the average homesale transaction value is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;\n\n•homesale transactions occur infrequently;\n\n•there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;\n\n•a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services as well as assistance with the inspection process and other aspects of the transaction; \n\n•the consumer preference to visit properties for sale in person, notwithstanding the availability of online images and property tours; and\n\n•there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space. \n\nCyclical nature of industry, long-term demographics and seasonality. The U.S. residential real estate industry exhibits a cyclical nature, characterized by periods of downturns as observed since mid-2022 and from 2006 to 2011, followed by phases of recovery and growth, exemplified from 2012 to 2021. Currently, the market is at historic lows, with 2023 and 2024 having the lowest homesale transactions since 1995, according to NAR data. These cycles are typically affected by broader economic shifts and conditions within the residential real estate market, factors largely beyond our control.\n\nWe believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is impacted by various factors. Chief among these are housing affordability, the overall economic well-being of the U.S., and pivotal demographic trends, including generational transitions, and the rise in U.S. household formations. Elements such as mortgage rates and mortgage availability, tax incentives, job market dynamics, the conversion of renters to homebuyers, and the intrinsic benefits associated with homeownership further contribute to the industry's trajectory. \n\nWhile the U.S. residential real estate market experienced substantial declines since 2022, we maintain an optimistic outlook on the growth of the residential real estate market over the mid to long term. Our optimism is rooted in the anticipation of enduring positive fundamentals, such as U.S. population over the last decade, and the expected growth in the number of U.S. households, particularly among the millennial generation, over the coming decade. \n\nThe U.S. residential housing market is also seasonal. Typically, a heightened volume of homesale transactions occurs in the second and third quarters of each year. Consequently, our historical data reveals stronger operating results and revenues during these periods.\n\nUncertainties Relating to the Residential Real Estate Industry. The U.S. residential real estate brokerage industry is currently in the midst of a period of significant uncertainty driven by actual and potential changes to a number of industry rules or practices that impact the functioning of the U.S. residential brokerage industry and our business. For more information, see \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\" and \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks\".\n\nParticipation in Multiple Aspects of Residential Real Estate\n\nWe participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our complementary businesses and minority-held joint ventures, including our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures, work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation, lead generation services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and real estate benefit program clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. All of our businesses and our minority-owned joint ventures can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.\n\n7\n\n\nOur Brands \n\nOur brands are among the most well-known and established real estate brokerage brands in the real estate industry.\n\nTogether with our strategic joint ventures, our brands allow us to leverage our strengths, while participating in multiple markets within the real estate industry. Specifically, while all of our brands compete to varying extents in the high-end markets, our Sotheby’s International Realty® and Corcoran® brands are particularly well-positioned to benefit from growth in high-end markets. Likewise, while all of our brands utilize offerings through Title Group, our company owned Coldwell Banker® brand shares synergies with our title business as well as our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures that allow us to progress towards our goal to integrate and streamline the residential real estate transaction. In addition, our global franchise brands including Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate, CENTURY 21® and ERA®, as well as franchised Sotheby’s International Realty®, Corcoran® and Coldwell Banker® brokerages, provide us with attractive scale and afford us the ability to offer versatility of choice to franchisees and consumers.\n\nOur real estate brands are listed in the following chart, which includes information as of December 31, 2024, for both our franchised and company owned offices:\n\nBrands (1)\n\nWorldwide Offices (2)\n\n11,0002,9001,1002,300400100\n\nWorldwide Brokers and \n\nSales Agents (2)\n\n130,20096,30026,10043,20011,2004,900\n\nU.S. Annual Sides\n\n219,329468,004117,86070,09258,23116,494\n\n# of Countries and Territories with Owned or Franchised Operations\n\n7945843769\n\nCharacteristics\n\nA 50+ year leader in brand awareness and a top recognized and respected name in real estate\n\nSignificant international office footprint\n\n119-year legacy in real estate\n\n    Coldwell Banker Global Luxury® program to uniquely market top tier listings\n\n    Long-time industry leader in effective advertising\n\nSynonymous with luxury Strong ties to auction house established in 1744Powerful global presenceLongstanding commitment to technology and innovationDriving performance through innovation, collaboration, diversity and growthUnique opportunity for flexible brandingStrong brand name recognition\n\nUnique access to consumers, marketing channels and content through brand licensing relationship with a leading media company\n\nLeading residential real estate brand for 50+ years\n\nCommitment to white-glove service, customer-centric brand, and \"Live Who You Are\" philosophy\n\n_______________\n\n(1)Information presented for Coldwell Banker® includes Coldwell Banker Commercial®.\n\n(2)Includes information reported to us by independently owned franchisees (including approximately 12,500 offices and approximately 132,700 related brokers and independent sales agents of non-U.S. franchisees and franchisors).\n\n8\n\n\nAnywhere Brands—Franchise Group\n\nOverview—Franchise Business\n\nFranchise Group is comprised of our franchise business as well as our lead generation and relocation services operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 311,900 independent sales agents worldwide, including approximately 179,200 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. (which included approximately 52,900 company owned brokerage independent sales agents). As of December 31, 2024, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 17,800 offices worldwide in 119 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 5,300 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 580 company owned brokerage offices).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, on a year-over-year basis, independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages experienced a 7% decline (based on the Company's internal data) and independent sales agents affiliated with our U.S. franchisees experienced a 4% decline (based on information provided by our affiliated franchisees).\n\nThe average tenure among our U.S. franchisees is approximately 23 years as of December 31, 2024. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with servicing programs, technology, and learning and development as well as dedicated national marketing programs to facilitate our franchisees in developing their business.\n\nOur primary objectives as a franchisor of residential real estate brokerages are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support (including via proprietary and third-party products and services) to our franchisees and their independent sales agents.\n\nOperations—Franchising\n\nWe derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees and Owned Brokerage Group for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales commission earned from closed homesale sides, which we refer to as gross commission income.\n\nFranchise Group's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides (either the \"buy\" side and/or the \"sell\" side of a real estate transaction) in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate. Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved, if applicable, and net of other incentives granted to franchisees.\n\nIn addition to domestic royalty revenue, Franchise Group earns revenue from marketing fees, the strategic alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees.\n\nDuring 2024, none of our franchisees (other than Owned Brokerage Group) generated more than 3% of the total revenue of our real estate franchise business.\n\nOur franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) are independent business operators and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations, including with respect to their pricing, hiring or affiliation practices.\n\nDomestic Franchisees. Franchise agreements set forth certain limited guidelines on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the mandatory identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years.\n\nThese franchisee agreements generally require the franchisee to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus a royalty fee that is a percentage of gross commission income, if any, earned by the franchisee. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways, and we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or \n\n9\n\n\nrestructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.\n\nCertain of our brands utilize a volume-based incentive model with a royalty fee rate that is initially equal to 6% of the franchisee's gross commission income, but subject to reduction based upon volume incentives. Under this model, the franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. The volume incentive varies for each franchise system. We provide a detailed table to each eligible franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations.\n\nCertain franchisees (including some of our largest franchisees) have a flat percentage royalty fee. Under this model, franchisees pay a fixed percentage (generally less than 6%) of their commission income to us and the percentage does not change during the year or over the term of their franchise agreement. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOur Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise business utilizes a capped fee model, which has applied to any new franchisee since 2019 as well as preexisting franchisees who elect to switch from their current royalty fee structure to the capped fee model. Under this model, franchisees pay a royalty fee (generally equal to 5% of their commission income) capped at a set amount per independent sales agent per year, subject to our right to annually modify or increase the independent sales agent cap. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOur Corcoran franchise business utilizes a tiered royalty fee model under which franchisees pay us a percentage of their gross commission income as a royalty fee. The royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 6% and decreases in steps during each calendar year to a minimum of 4% as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels. Similarly, our Coldwell Banker® residential franchise business began offering a tiered royalty fee model in 2021, under which the royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 5.5% and decreases in steps during the calendar year to a minimum of 3% as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels. Under this tiered royalty fee model, we reserve the right to annually modify or increase the gross commission income levels, subject to certain limitations. Franchisees on the tiered royalty fee model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.\n\nOther incentives may be used as consideration to attract new franchisees, grow franchisees (including through independent sales agent recruitment) or extend existing franchise agreements. Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes or other note-backed funding which we provide to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Franchisees may also use the proceeds from note-backed funding to update marketing materials or upgrade technology and websites. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed, and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably generally over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met or the franchise agreement terminates, franchisees may be required to repay a portion of the outstanding notes.\n\nEach of our current franchise systems requires franchisees and company owned brokerages to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand in accordance with the applicable franchise agreement. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations, broker and agent marketing tools and products and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, in certain instances, Franchise Group may be required to make contributions to certain marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.\n\nIn addition to offices owned and operated by our third-party franchisees, as of December 31, 2024, we, through Owned Brokerage Group, own and operate approximately 580 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® brand names. The domestic royalty revenue from Owned Brokerage Group is calculated by multiplying (i) homesale sides by (ii) average sale price by (iii) average brokerage commission rate by (iv) their contractual royalty rate. Owned Brokerage Group pays intercompany royalty fees of approximately 6% and marketing fees to Franchise Group in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment \n\n10\n\n\nlevel and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses. Owned Brokerage Group does not participate in volume incentive or other incentive programs.\n\nInternational Third-Party Franchisees. In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators. We also utilize a direct franchising model outside of the U.S. for Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® and, in some cases, Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. For all other brands, we generally employ a master franchise model outside of the U.S., whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. Under both the direct and master franchise models outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties. Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.\n\nWe have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's (\"Sotheby's\"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices. Our license agreement is terminable by Sotheby's prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, (3) a court issues a non-appealable, final judgment that we have committed certain breaches of the license agreement and we fail to cure such breaches within 60 days of the issuance of such judgment, or (4) we discontinue the use of all of the trademarks licensed under the license agreement for a period of twelve consecutive months.\n\nIn October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith Operations Corporation, successor in interest to Meredith Corporation (\"Meredith Ops\"). The license agreement between Anywhere and Meredith Ops is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith Ops for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee. Our license agreement is terminable by Meredith Ops prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, or (3) a trial court issues a final judgment that we are in material breach of the license agreement or any representation or warranty we made was false or materially misleading when made.\n\nOperations—Other\n\nCartus® Relocation Services. Cartus, a provider of global relocation services, offers a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for employee and employer. The wide range of services we offer allow our clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us. Our broad array of services include, but are not limited to, homesale assistance, relocation policy counseling and group move management services, consulting services, expense processing and relocation-related accounting, compensation support and compliance, and visa and immigration support. We also arrange household goods moving services and provide support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods.\n\nWe primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, including 38% of the Fortune 50 companies in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 25 years with us. Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If \n\n11\n\n\na client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.\n\nThere are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn a commission from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. Furthermore, Cartus continues to provide value through the generation of leads to real estate agent and brokerage participants in the networks maintained by Leads Group, which drives downstream revenue for our businesses.\n\nLead Generation. Through Leads Group, a part of Franchise Group, we seek to provide high-quality leads to independent sales agents, through real estate benefit programs that provide home-buying and selling assistance to customers of lenders, organizations such as credit unions and interest groups that have established members who are buying or selling a home as well as to consumers and corporations who have expressed interest in a certain brand, product or service (such as relocation services), including those offered by Anywhere. Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated, with one client-directed real estate benefit program contributing a substantial majority of the high-quality leads generated through our lead generation programs, and our client-directed programs are non-exclusive and terminable at any time at the option of the client. We also maintain Company-driven real estate benefit programs and additional leads may be generated via other strategic initiatives, including through consumer-focused products and services we may develop or offer. We expect that significant time, effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of, and participation in, programs, partnerships or products and services that are intended to aid in lead generation.\n\nStrategic Alliance Program. We offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our strategic alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us an initial access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the strategic alliance vendors.\n\nAnywhere Advisors—Owned Brokerage Group \n\nOverview\n\nThrough Owned Brokerage Group we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in many of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our brokerage offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® franchised brands.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 580 company owned brokerage offices and approximately 52,900 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices. Of those offices, we operated approximately 88% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 8% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and approximately 4% of our offices under the Corcoran® brand name.\n\nWe intend to continue to seek to increase the productivity of company owned brokerage offices, including by optimizing efficiencies, streamlining transactional processes and centralizing back-office operations. We will continue to work with office managers to attract and retain independent sales agents who can successfully engage in and promote transactions from new and existing clients. From time to time, we may also execute strategic acquisitions. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations to reduce or eliminate duplicative costs and to leverage our existing infrastructure to support newly affiliated independent sales agents.\n\nOperations—Brokerage\n\nOur company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received for serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.37%, which represents the average commission rate earned on either the \"buy\" side or the \"sell\" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. Owned Brokerage Group, as a franchisee of Franchise Group, pays marketing fees and a royalty fee of approximately 6% of the gross commission income earned per real estate transaction to Franchise Group; however, such amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Owned Brokerage Group paid marketing fees and royalties to Franchise Group of $319 million and $315 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n12\n\n\nThe remainder of gross commission income is split between the broker (Owned Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement (which specifies the portion of the broker commission to be paid to the agent), which varies by agent.\n\nIn addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services offered through our other segments, including title, escrow and settlement, mortgage origination, homeowners insurance and relocation services. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.\n\nWhen we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with an array of services, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, and assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In addition, Owned Brokerage Group has relationships with developers in select major cities (in particular New York City) to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.\n\nAnywhere Integrated Services—Title Group\n\nOverview\n\nTitle Group is comprised of our title agency business that conducts title, escrow and settlement services and also includes the Company' share of equity earnings and losses from certain non-exclusive joint ventures, including, among others, Guaranteed Rate Affinity (a mortgage origination joint venture) and the title insurance underwriter joint venture (see below under the header \"Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture\" for additional information). Our equity earnings or losses related to minority-owned joint ventures such as Guaranteed Rate Affinity and the title insurance underwriter joint venture are included in the financial results of Title Group but are not reported as revenue to Title Group. \n\nOur title agency business provides title search, examination, clearance and policy issuance services and conducts the closing process and funds disbursement for lenders, real estate agents, attorneys and homebuilders and their customers on purchase transactions and lenders and their customers on refinance transactions. \n\nWe intend to grow our title, escrow and settlement services business by recruiting successful title and escrow sales personnel in existing markets. We will also seek to increase our capture rate of title business from Owned Brokerage Group homesale sides.\n\nOperations\n\nTitle Agency Services; Title, Escrow and Settlement Services. We are licensed as a title agent in 43 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 350 offices, approximately 126 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices. In addition to our own title, escrow and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution clients on a national basis.\n\nOur title, escrow and settlement services business provides full-service title, escrow and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to consumers, real estate companies, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses. We provide closing and escrow services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from financial institutions and loan officers throughout the mortgage lending industry. \n\nOur company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title, escrow and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Many of our offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. In 2024, our title, escrow and settlement services business was involved in approximately 39,000 transactions related to Owned Brokerage Group. The capture rate of our title, escrow and settlement services business from buyers or sellers represented by our company owned brokerages was approximately 31% in 2024. Other sources of our title, escrow and settlement services homesale business include Franchise Group, Leads Group, home builders and unaffiliated brokerage operations.\n\nVirtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the \n\n13\n\n\nstandard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search (searching for and retrieving all public records concerning the property and its owners) may be performed by the title agent, an underwriter or contracted to a third party while the examination function (inspecting all such public records for any defects in the chain of title) is always performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium \"split\" is generally determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter and, in some states, is promulgated by state law. We derive revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold.\n\nWe have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses.\n\nOther Revenue. Other revenue generated by our title agency business includes closing protection letters, title searches, survey business, tax search, wire fees, and other fees ancillary to their services.\n\nJoint Ventures. \n\nMortgage Origination. Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, Inc. (\"Guaranteed Rate\"), began doing business in August 2017. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates mortgage loans, including both purchase and refinancing transactions, to be sold in the secondary market. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates and markets its mortgage lending services to real estate agents across the country (including to independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchised brokerages) and relocation companies (including our relocation operations) as well as a broad consumer audience. \n\nMany of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. Our company owned brokerage operations represented approximately half of Guaranteed Rate Affinity's purchase transactions, as well as approximately half of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s mortgage origination business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nUnder the Operating Agreement (the \"GRA Agreement\") between a subsidiary of Title Group and a subsidiary of Guaranteed Rate (the \"GRA Member\"), we own 49.9% of the home mortgage joint venture and Guaranteed Rate indirectly owns the remaining 50.1%. Under the GRA Agreement, Guaranteed Rate Affinity is to distribute to each of the Company and Guaranteed Rate the distributable net income based on each member's ownership interest percentage following the close of each quarter. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture. Guaranteed Rate Affinity is licensed to conduct mortgage operations in 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe GRA Agreement is for an initial 10-year term (ending August 2027) and automatically renews for additional 5-year terms, unless either party provides advance notice to terminate, provided that if certain performance metrics are achieved after the fifth year of the agreement, the first 5-year extension is not subject to termination upon advance notice. Either party can terminate the GRA Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, a change in control of the other member, subject to certain exceptions, or upon material breach by the other member not remediated within the cure period. We have certain additional performance-based termination rights.\n\nThe GRA Agreement does not prohibit Guaranteed Rate, directly or indirectly through joint ventures with other parties, from operating its separate mortgage origination business and does not limit the Company, Guaranteed Rate, or either of their subsidiaries from operating non-mortgage origination lines of business in locations where Guaranteed Rate Affinity operates. In addition, the Company is permitted to have ventures with other mortgage loan originators, but Guaranteed Rate has a 30-day right-of-first-refusal to acquire any mortgage origination business that we intend to acquire.\n\nTitle Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture. In March 2022, the Company sold its title insurance underwriter, Title Resources Guaranty Company (the \"Title Underwriter\") (previously reported in the Title Group reportable segment) in exchange for cash and a minority equity stake in the form of common units in a title insurance underwriter joint venture that owns the Title Underwriter (the \"Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture\"). The Company owns a 22% equity interest and other joint venture partners own a majority equity stake in the joint venture in the form of preferred units that carry liquidation preference rights. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with a subsidiary of the Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture related to the sale of 10% of the preferred equity in entities containing the assets of certain of the Company's title and escrow entities for $18.8 million, with a right to purchase 100% of those entities at the same valuation \n\n14\n\n\nused for the initial purchase. The transaction includes customary minority protections, is contingent on certain conditions, and remains subject to termination provisions outlined in the term sheet.\n\nProducts, Technology and Marketing\n\nProducts and Technology—Agents. Core to our integrated business strategy is our ability to provide independent sales agents at company owned and franchised brokerages with compelling data and technology-powered products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable.\n\nThe marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously develop and improve our marketing and technology-powered products and services is part of our value proposition to company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our other businesses. Increasingly, these products and services are desired as an integrated set of tools, rather than stand-alone products and services.\n\nWe continue to develop product and marketing capabilities designed to support the continuous creation and delivery of both our proprietary tools and third-party products to affiliated independent sales agents in order to deliver a more comprehensive platform experience. Our technology platform is designed to offer affiliated independent sales agents and brokers seamless access to both proprietary tools and third-party products, enabling choice among such agents and brokers to leverage the mix of tools that best serve their needs.\n\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop or procure marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of affiliated independent sales agents. \n\nOur Anywhere-provided platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our independent sales agents, franchisees (and their independent sales agents) and consumers by:\n\n•aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions;\n\n•connecting affiliated agents and brokers to a CRM tool that allows for the cultivation of productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction;\n\n•enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites; \n\n•informing affiliated agents of valuable client insight to help those agents increase their productivity;\n\n•providing consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents;\n\n•providing key back-office processes, including listing and transaction management, reporting, marketing, and agent profiles; and\n\n•delivering business planning tools that enable our franchisees to track their progress against key business objectives in real time.\n\nProducts and Technology—Consumers. We continue to focus on the consumer experience as well, seeking to improve the experience of buying and selling a home by creating an easier and integrated experience for all parts of a consumer's transaction. We expect to continue to invest in the development and/or procurement of products and technology designed to deliver valuable capabilities via digital channels throughout the lifecycle of home ownership.\n\nMarketing. Each of our brands manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive leads to affiliated agents, increase brand awareness and perception, promote our network and offerings to the real estate industry and engage our customer base.\n\nEach of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees (including company owned offices), although we may make discretionary contributions to any of the marketing funds and in certain instances are required to make contributions to certain marketing funds.\n\nLikewise, our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.\n\n15\n\n\nOur marketing programs, tools and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective affiliated independent sales agents by:\n\n•showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the listing agents of these properties;\n\n•building and maintaining brand awareness and preference for the brand; and\n\n•increasing the local recognition of affiliated agents and brokerages.\n\nMarketing programs are executed using a variety of media including, but not limited to, social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising. \n\nListings and Websites. The internet is the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We transmit listings to various platforms and services, place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites, and operate a variety of our own websites. We place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers.\n\nOur brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. Additionally, each brand website allows independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers. \n\nEducation\n\nEach real estate brand provides franchisees access to learning, development, and continuing education materials for use in connection with their real estate sales businesses. Use of such materials by affiliated brokers and independent sales agents is voluntary and discretionary. Independent sales agents affiliated with a company owned brokerage must complete onboarding training and compliance training related to fair housing (in addition to their state licensing fair housing obligations).\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nEmployees. Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy. Our team includes a broad range of professionals, given the breadth of services offered by our three business segments and Corporate. The wide array of skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefits our operations and performance.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,805 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees. At December 31, 2024, approximately 575 of our employees were located outside of the U.S., almost all of whom were employed by Cartus (a part of Anywhere Brands).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately half of our employees continued to work remotely on a full-time basis. Certain employees, in particular consumer-facing employees at our company-owned brokerages, operated in an office-based environment, while other employees worked in a hybrid model.\n\nNone of our employees are represented by a union.\n\nTo assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we annually survey employees with the assistance of third-party consultants and implement actions to address areas of employee feedback. In 2024, we achieved an 86% engagement score and an 87% response rate.\n\nAll employees are required to participate in annual training programs designed to address subjects of key importance to our business, including the Company’s Code of Ethics. Nearly 100% of active employees in each of the past three years have completed our annual Code of Ethics training. Code of Ethics training in 2024 covered topics such as promoting an ethical culture, reporting conflicts of interest, and compliance with RESPA. Other mandatory training in 2024 included global information security and data governance. Biennial anti-harassment training is delivered to all employees and more frequently based on position or where required by law. Certain employees also receive training on topics such as preventing global modern slavery, insider trading, California workplace violence, and unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices training, and additional mandatory training courses are delivered based upon the employee position or local requirements. Our learning and development platform offers employees additional resources to continue to grow professionally, including access to on-demand training through LinkedIn Learning and tools for career management. \n\n16\n\n\nIndependent Sales Agents. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, the successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of our company owned brokerage operations. Additional information about the base of independent sales agents affiliated with company owned brokerages as well as franchisees is located in this Item 1. under \"Anywhere Brands—Franchise Group—Overview—Franchise Business.\"\n\nCompetition\n\nReal Estate Brokerage Industry. The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company-owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the economic relationship between the broker and the agent (including the share of commission income retained by the agent and fees charged to or paid by the agent for services provided by the broker), consumer preferences, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors, including macro-economic factors such as national, regional and local economic conditions. In addition, the legal and regulatory environment as well as the rules of NAR, industry associations and MLSs can impact competition. See \"Government and Other Regulations\" below.\n\nWe and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business as well as for independent sales agents with national and regional independent real estate brokerages and franchisors, discount and limited service brokerages, non-traditional market participants, and with franchisees of our brands. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate), Howard Hanna Holdings, Compass, Inc. (which recently acquired @properties), Redfin Corporation, EXP Realty (a subsidiary of eXp World Holdings, Inc.), Weichert Realtors as well as several large franchisors, including RE/MAX International, Inc., Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and HSF Affiliates LLC (operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate). We and affiliated franchisees also compete with leading listing aggregators, such as Zillow, Inc. and Realtor.com® (a listing aggregator held by News Corp.) as well as Homes.com (a listing aggregator held by CoStar Group, Inc.). In addition, we and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business with several iBuyers, including Opendoor and Offerpad.\n\nCompetition for Independent Sales Agents. The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is critical to the business and financial results of traditional brokerages—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition for productive independent sales agents in our industry is high and competition is most intense for highly productive independent sales agents with strong reputations in their respective communities. \n\nMost of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of its independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated and other company-generated leads. Many factors impact recruitment and retention efforts, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for independent sales agents from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, technology offerings as well as marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the quality of the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, the location and quality of office space, as well as continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. \n\nWe believe that a variety of factors in recent years have negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents in the industry generally and have increasingly impacted our recruitment and retention of top producing agents and put upward pressure on the average share of commissions paid to affiliated independent sales agents. Such factors include increasing competition, increasing levels of commissions paid to agents (including up-front payments and equity), changes in the spending patterns of independent sales agents (as more agents purchase services from third parties outside of their affiliated broker), a heightening focus on leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales agent from the brokerage, differentiation in the bundling of agent services or industry offerings (including virtual brokerages or other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income, or other compensation, such as marketing funds and sign-on or equity awards), and the growth in independent sales agent teams. Competition comes from newer models as well, including brokerages that provide certain services to agents and agent teams, but with branding focused on the name of the agent or agent team, rather than the brokerage brand.\n\nCommission Plan Competition Among Real Estate Brokerages. Some of the firms competing for sales agents use different commission plans, which may be appealing to certain sales agents. There are several different commission plan variations that have been historically utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents. One of the most common variations has been the traditional graduated commission model where the independent sales agent receives a \n\n17\n\n\npercentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales agent increases his or her volume of homesale transactions, and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales agents with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties. Other common plans include a desk rental (sometimes referred to as a 100% commission plan), a fixed transaction fee commission plan, and a capped commission plan. A capped commission plan generally blends aspects of the traditional graduated commission model with the 100% commission plan. Although less common, some real estate brokerages employ their sales agents, and in such instances, employee agents may earn smaller brokerage commissions in exchange for other employee benefits or bonuses. Most brokerages focus primarily on one type of commission plan, though some may offer one or more commission plan variations to their sales agents.\n\nIn many of their markets, Owned Brokerage Group offers a traditional graduated commission model, which emphasizes our value proposition. The traditional graduated commission model has experienced declines in market share over the past several years. Increasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed.\n\nLow Barriers to Entry. The real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants utilizing historical real estate brokerage models and those pursuing alternative variations of those models (including virtual brokerages and brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income) as well as non-traditional methods of marketing real estate (such as iBuyers). There are also market participants who differentiate themselves by offering consumers flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions (often coupled with fewer services). The significant size of the U.S. real estate market has continued to attract outside capital investment in disruptive and traditional competitors that seek to access a portion of this market. These competitors and their investors may pursue increases in market share over profitability, further complicating the competitive landscape. \n\nNon-Traditional Competition and Industry Disruption. While real estate brokers using historical real estate brokerage models typically compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, brokerage commission, reputation, utilization of technology and personal contacts, participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate may compete in other ways, including companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models or minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model.\n\nA growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, virtual brokerage and other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income, known in the industry as a higher \"split\" (or other compensation, such as sign-on or equity awards), directly compete with traditional brokerage models and may dilute the relationship between the brokerage and the agent and add additional competitive pressure for independent sales agent talent. Likewise, certain alternative transaction models that are less reliant on brokerages and sales agents could have a negative impact on such brokerages and agents as well as on the average homesale broker commission rate. These models also look to capture other real estate services such as title and mortgage services and referral fees. Changes to industry rules and/or the introduction of disruptive products and services may also result in an increase in the number of transactions that do not utilize the services of independent sales agents, including for sale by owner transactions. \n\nIn addition, the concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions including, but not limited to, setting up competing brokerages and/or expanding their offerings to include products (such as agent tools) and services that are a part of or related to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us, charging significant referral, listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. These actions divert and reduce the earnings of other industry participants, including our company owned and franchised brokerages. Aggregators could intensify their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry. Such tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with affiliated franchisees and such franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and buyers and sellers of homes.\n\nFranchise Competition. According to NAR, approximately 40% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and \n\n18\n\n\nimprove the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and can include volume and other incentives, flat royalty and marketing fees, capped royalty fees, and discounted royalty and marketing fees. Taking into account competitive factors, we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.\n\nRelocation Operations. Competition in our corporate relocation operations is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation service providers in the corporate relocation operations. The larger outsourced relocation service providers that we compete with include SIRVA Worldwide, Inc., Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc., Aires and Graebel Companies, Inc. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend.\n\nLead Generation Business. The ability of a brokerage, whether company owned or franchised, to provide its independent sales agents with high-quality leads is increasingly important to the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and sales agent teams and the attraction and retention of franchisees. Numerous companies that market and sell residential real estate leads to independent sales agents, including listing aggregators, compete with our real estate benefit programs and other lead generation programs.\n\nTitle Agency Business. The title, escrow and settlement services business is highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country our title agency business competes with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management companies.\n\nIntegrated Services. Increasingly residential real estate market participants have sought to establish more integrated business models that include the provision of additional services to the consumer, such as title agency, mortgage origination and homeowner's insurance. Similarly, certain mortgage origination providers seek to broaden their access to the profit pools surrounding the residential real estate transaction, including real estate brokerage commissions. Some mortgage companies have created their own agent networks and may expand further into real estate. These factors have resulted in additional competitive pressure to our individual business units as well as the Company as a whole.\n\nFor additional information on the competitive risks facing our businesses, see \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Strategic & Operational Risks\", in particular under the caption \"The businesses in which we, our joint ventures, and our franchisees operate are intensely competitive and we may not be able to effectively compete.\"\n\nGovernment and Other Regulations \n\nSee Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on the Company's legal proceedings. For additional information with respect to related risks facing our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" in particular under the heading \"Regulatory and Legal Risks\", in this Annual Report.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment. All of our businesses, as well as the businesses of our joint ventures (such as mortgage origination, title insurance underwriting, and real estate auction) and the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and subject to shifts in public policy, statutory interpretation and enforcement priorities of regulators and other government authorities as well as amendments to existing regulations and regulatory guidance. Likewise, litigation, investigations, claims and regulatory proceedings against us or other participants in the residential real estate industry or relocation industry—or against companies in other industries—may impact the Company and its affiliated franchisees when the rulings or settlements in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry or business community and may generate litigation or investigations for the Company. In addition, through our subsidiaries, employees and/or affiliated agents, we are a participant in many MLSs and a member-owner of certain non-NAR controlled MLSs. Our affiliated agents may be members of NAR and respective state and local realtor associations. The rules and policies for these organizations are also subject to change due to shifts in internal policy, regulatory developments, litigation or other legal action. Changes in the rules and policies of NAR and/or any MLSs can also be driven by changes in membership, including the entry of new industry participants, and other industry forces.\n\nFrom time to time, certain industry practices have come under federal or state scrutiny or have been the subject of litigation. The industry is currently experiencing increased scrutiny by regulators and other government offices, both on a federal and state level. Four of the more active areas in our industry have been antitrust and competition, compliance with RESPA (and similar state statutes), compliance with the TCPA (and similar state statutes) and worker classification. Other examples \n\n19\n\n\ninclude, but are not limited to, consumer protection, mortgage lending and debt collection laws, federal and state fair housing laws, various broker fiduciary duties, false or fraudulent claims laws, and state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates, environmental regulation and gifts to consumers.\n\nAntitrust, Competition and Bribery Laws. Our business is subject to antitrust and competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act and related federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. The penalties for violating antitrust and competition laws can be severe. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, dividing markets, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. For additional discussion, see \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\" and \"Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks\".\n\nOur international business activities, and in particular our relocation operations, must comply with applicable laws and regulations that impose sanctions on improper payments, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of other countries.\n\nMultiple Listing Services Rules. MLSs, NAR and respective state and local realtor associations each maintain rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service, that specify, among other things, how MLS data and listings may be accessed, used, and displayed on websites and mobile applications. The rules of each MLS can vary widely and are complex. \n\nRESPA. RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws, state title insurance laws, and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance, home warranty and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, title agency, lead generation, and relocation operations or the businesses of our joint ventures (including mortgage origination, title underwriting and real estate auction). In addition, with respect to many of our businesses as well as the businesses of certain of our joint ventures, RESPA and similar state laws generally require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Some state authorities have also asserted RESPA enforcement rights.\n\nRESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between title underwriters and their agents, among real estate brokers, real estate brokers and agents, and market-based fees for the provision of goods or services, including marketing services. In addition, RESPA allows for the operation of affiliated business arrangements, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met. We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA. However, expansive interpretations or aggressive enforcement of RESPA or similar state statutes by regulators and/or certain courts can raise compliance challenges. Permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly, and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. Some regulators and other parties have advanced novel and stringent interpretations of RESPA including assertions that any provision of a thing of value in a separate but contemporaneous transaction with a referral constitutes a breach of RESPA on the basis that all things of value exchanged should be deemed in exchange for the referral. Violations of RESPA or similar state statutes can lead to claims of substantial damages, which may include (but are not limited to) fines, treble damages and attorneys' fees.\n\nWe are also subject to state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers, which impacts our lead generation business.\n\nWorker Classification. Although the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations and our affiliated franchisees by seeking to reclassify licensed sales agents as employees.\n\nReal estate laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors. Federal and state agencies have their own rules and tests for classification of independent contractors as well as to determine whether employees meet exemptions from minimum wages and overtime laws. These tests consider many factors that also vary from state to state. The tests continue to evolve based on state case law decisions, regulations and legislative changes.\n\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations. To run our business, it is essential for us to collect, store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, independent agents, and relocation transferees in \n\n20\n\n\nour systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. For example, in the U.S., we are required to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information, as well as state statutes governing privacy and cybersecurity matters like the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and the New York Department of Financial Services (\"NYDFS\") Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nThe CCPA imposes comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect, sell and disclose personal information about California residents and employees. In November 2020, California passed Proposition 24, establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which took effect January 1, 2023. The CPRA provides further requirements that will impact our businesses’ compliance efforts and operational risks as the CPRA differentiates “personal information” and “sensitive information,” expands the term “sale” to include sharing of personal information, and imposes data minimization and data retention requirements. The CPRA also established the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is intended to take a more active role in enforcement of the law. As of January 2025, 19 states enacted their own privacy legislation which is effective or will become effective within a year, more than doubling the number of states requiring businesses to comply with privacy obligations and the number of individuals who will have privacy rights with respect to their personal information. \n\nUnder the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation, regulated financial institutions, including Title Group, are required to establish and attest to a detailed cybersecurity program. Other state regulatory agencies have or are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation.\n\nInternationally, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") has conferred significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents) and materially increased penalties for violations. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, one of the methods for transfers of personal data into the U.S. As a result, companies may have to rely on standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules for the transfer of personal data while awaiting further guidance or regulation. In 2021, the European Commission issued an implementing decision regarding the use of Standard Contractual Clauses. In 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Other countries have also recently expanded on their data privacy laws and regulations. \n\nFor additional information with respect to our cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance framework, see \"Item 1C.—Cybersecurity.\" for additional information with respect to the cybersecurity-related risks facing our business, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report, in particular under the caption \"Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information or litigation or claims arising from such incidents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.\"\n\nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The TCPA restricts certain types of telemarketing calls and text messaging, and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice messages. The TCPA also established a national Do-Not-Call registry. The TCPA defines autodialing broadly and requires express written consent for certain communications to cellphones. Certain states have also adopted, or may in the future adopt, state equivalents of the TCPA. We are vulnerable to claims made by class action consumers alleging that we are liable for contacts made by franchisees and/or independent contractor real estate agents.\n\nFranchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by federal law under the jurisdiction of the FTC. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, multiple states and U.S. territories have \"franchise relationship laws\" or \"business opportunity laws\" that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements (including mandated notice or cure periods), to discriminate unfairly among franchisees, or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the franchisors. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.\n\nState Brokerage Laws. Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales \n\n21\n\n\nagents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary, and agency and statutory duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise affiliated sales agents and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses. \n\nOur company owned and franchised brokerages (and independent sales agents affiliated with such brokerages) are also required to comply with state and local laws related to dual agency (such as where the same brokerage represents both the buyer and seller of a home), and increased regulation of dual agency representation may restrict or reduce the ability of impacted brokerages to participate in certain real estate transactions.\n\nAnti-Discrimination Laws. Our company owned and franchised brokerages, and agents affiliated with such brokerages, as well as our other businesses are subject to federal and state housing laws that generally make it illegal to discriminate against protected classes of individuals in housing or brokerage services. For example, the Fair Housing Act, its state and local law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, all prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, and, in some states or locales, financial capability, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or source of income. The U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\"), through the Fair Housing Testing Program, utilizes individuals who, without any bona fide intent to rent or purchase housing or enter into a mortgage loan, pose as prospective renters, buyers or borrower for the purpose of determining whether businesses are engaging in potentially unlawful housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Certain states or locales, such as New York, have or are in the process of expanding their laws.\n\nRegulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Nearly all states license and regulate title agencies, escrow companies and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent and/or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States may periodically lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States may also require title agencies, escrow companies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital.\n\nCertain states in which we operate have \"controlled business\" statutes which impose limitations on the percentage of business our title and escrow companies can receive from its affiliated real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit, we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. \"Controlled business\" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, or are under common control with, the title agent. Pursuant to regulations in New York, title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain and be open for title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. The Company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the payment of fines and penalties or the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title, escrow and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable \"controlled business\" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control.\n\nRegulation of the Mortgage Industry. We participate in the mortgage origination business through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Private mortgage lenders operating in the U.S. are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation and to significant oversight by government sponsored entities. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation. As we do not own any real property of significance, we are not currently materially impacted by environmental regulations. However, in recent years, an increasing number of state and federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that require new climate/environmental-related disclosures, including, for example, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (CCDAA) and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (CRFRA)—together, the California Climate Accountability Package—enacted by California in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would require us to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks by 2026.\n\n22\n\n\nItem 1A.  Risk Factors.\n\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our Company and our common stock. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. Please be advised that past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in the future.\n\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nThe residential real estate market is cyclical and we are negatively impacted by downturns and disruptions in this market.\n\nThe residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic and residential real estate conditions which are beyond our control. The significant declines experienced in the U.S. residential real estate market since mid-2022 have materially negatively impacted our financial results. If the residential real estate market does not improve or worsens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business, invest in strategic initiatives, reduce indebtedness, return capital to stockholders and motivate, attract and retain our employees.\n\nAny of the following factors related to the real estate industry could negatively impact the housing market and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing a lack of sustained improvement or a decline in the number of homesales and/or stagnant or declining home prices, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenues and profitability:\n\n•prolonged periods of a high mortgage rate environment;\n\n•high rates of inflation;\n\n•continued or accelerated reductions in housing affordability;\n\n•continued or accelerated increases in the costs of home ownership, including but not limited to rising or high insurance costs and/or challenges in securing homeowners insurance, especially in areas affected by the increasing frequency and severity of weather events and natural disasters, and increases in other expenses, fees and taxes, including maintenance and association fees;\n\n•insufficient or excessive home inventory levels by market or price point;\n\n•the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation;\n\n•decreasing consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market;\n\n•an increase in potential homebuyers with low credit ratings or inability to afford down payments;\n\n•stringent mortgage standards, reduced availability of mortgage financing or increasing down payment requirements or other mortgage challenges;\n\n•an increase in foreclosure activity;\n\n•legislative or regulatory changes (including changes in regulatory interpretations or enforcement practices) - or industry changes driven by other market participants - that would adversely impact the residential real estate market;\n\n•federal, state and/or local income tax changes and other tax reform affecting real estate and/or real estate transactions;\n\n•decelerated or lack of building of new housing for homesales or increased building of new rental properties;\n\n•irregular timing of new development closings leading to lower unit sales at Owned Brokerage Group; and\n\n•changes in consumer preferences in the U.S., including declines in consumer demand, declines in home ownership levels, and homeowners retaining their homes for longer periods of time.\n\nWe are negatively impacted by adverse developments or the absence of sustained improvement in macroeconomic conditions (such as business, economic or political conditions) on a global, domestic or local basis.\n\nOur business and operations and those of our franchisees are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide. Contraction in the U.S. economy, including the impact of recessions, slow economic growth, or a deterioration in other economic factors such as potential consumer, business or governmental defaults or delinquencies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A deterioration in economic factors that particularly impact the residential real estate market and the business segments in which we operate, \n\n23\n\n\nwhether broadly or by geography and price segments, have and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results, which may be material. \n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to: short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, rate of wage growth, consumer confidence, rate of economic growth or contraction, uncertainty in the U.S. economy (including with respect to rising U.S. government debt levels), U.S. fiscal policy (including government spending and tax reform) and related matters (such as debt ceiling negotiations and the potential or actual shutdown of the U.S. government due to a failure to enact debt ceiling legislation), and the general condition of the U.S. and the world economy. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic environment. Weak capital, credit and financial markets, instability of financial institutions, and/or the lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nA host of factors beyond our control could cause fluctuations in these conditions or otherwise result in economic instability, supply chain disruptions and affect the global or US economy, including the political environment, U.S. immigration policies, disruptions in a major geoeconomic region (such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East), changes in equity or commodity markets, acts or threats of war or terrorism or sustained pervasive civil unrest, other geopolitical or economic instability, pandemics, material natural disasters, and tariffs, and any of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, new government policies on tariffs and immigration could raise the costs of and reduce construction of new housing, thereby further aggravating existing inventory shortages and affordability concerns.\n\nIncreasing or sustained high mortgage rates have resulted, and may continue to result, in declines in homesale transactions as well as declines in title, mortgage and refinancing activity.\n\nOur business is significantly affected by the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. These policies regulate the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and impact the real estate market through their effect on interest rates (and mortgage rates) as well as the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The Federal Reserve took aggressive action intended to control inflation in 2022 and 2023, including raising the target federal funds rate and reducing its holdings of mortgage-backed securities. While the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by a total of 100 basis points in 2024, mortgage rates have remained relatively high. Rising or high interest rates generally contribute to rising or high mortgage rates, which can lead to declines in residential real estate homesale transaction volume (as evidenced by the significant volume declines in the past two years), or to homebuilders discontinuing or delaying new projects, which could further contribute to inventory constraints and to inventory shortages as homeowners retain their homes for longer periods due to high mortgage rates.\n\nThe high interest rate environment has negatively impacted and, until the interest rate environment meaningfully improves, is expected to continue to negatively impact multiple aspects of our business, as increases in mortgage rates (as well as prolonged periods of high mortgage rates) generally have an adverse impact on homesale transaction volume, housing affordability, and title, mortgage and refinancing volumes. We believe the high mortgage rate environment is a key contributor to declines in residential real estate homesale transaction volume, as potential home sellers choose to stay with their lower mortgage rate rather than sell their home and pay a higher mortgage rate with the purchase of another home and potential home buyers choose to rent rather than pay higher mortgage rates. If existing homesale transactions continue to be at depressed levels or decline further (due to the high mortgage rate environment or otherwise), we would also expect to continue to experience decreased title, mortgage origination and refinancing activity.\n\nThe imposition of more stringent mortgage underwriting standards (due to changes in policy or otherwise) or a reduction in the availability of alternative mortgage products could also reduce homebuyers' ability to access the credit markets on reasonable terms and adversely affect the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes.\n\nChanges in the Federal Reserve's policies, the interest rate environment, and the mortgage market are beyond our control, are difficult to predict, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant decline in the number of homesale transactions or title, mortgage and refinancing activity due to any of the foregoing would adversely affect our financial and operating results, which may be material.\n\n24\n\n\nMeaningful decreases in average homesale brokerage commission rates have and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our financial results.\n\nThere are a variety of factors that could contribute to declines in the average homesale broker commission rate, including changes to industry rules or practices that disrupt the historical functioning of the residential real estate market (including with respect to the manner in which broker commissions are communicated, negotiated and paid, such as those resulting from the NAR Settlement discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\"), the rise of certain competitive brokerage or non-traditional competitor models, an increase in the popularity of discount brokers or other utilization of flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions as well as other competitive factors. Average homesale price and geographic mix have and could continue to contribute to declines in the average homesale broker commission rate, as higher priced homes tend to have a lower broker commission rate. \n\nThe average homesale broker commission rate for a homesale transaction is a key determinant of our profitability in Owned Brokerage Group and Franchise Group. Meaningful reductions in the average broker commission rate, including the average buy-side commission rate, have and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our revenues, earnings and financial results.\n\nSee also the below risk factor captioned “Changes to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results”.\n\nContinued erosion of our share of homesale brokerage commissions has and could continue to negatively affect, or could increasingly negatively affect, our financial results.\n\nIn addition to decreases in average homesale broker commission rates, continued erosion of our share of such homesale brokerage commission income (commonly referred to as our 'split' as homesale brokerage commissions are split between the broker (Owned Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement), as a result of changes to industry rules or practices, or otherwise, could continue to negatively affect our profitability. \n\nIntense industry competition for agents combined with our strategic emphasis on the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents has placed and is expected to continue to place upward pressure on our agent commission expense. This trend has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our profitability. Other market factors, including, but not limited to, competitors with access to outside capital that pursue increases in market share over profitability, models that operate at lower margins, including virtual brokerages and brokerages that operate in a more virtual fashion or reduced cost platforms, and listing aggregator concentration, market power and expansion into new ancillary products and services and leveraging their market power to channel consumers into those products and services, are expected to further erode our share of homesale brokerage commission income.\n\nIf independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages are paid a higher proportion of the commissions earned on a homesale transaction or the level of commission income we receive from a homesale transaction is otherwise reduced, the operating margins of our company owned residential brokerages could continue to be adversely affected.\n\nOur franchisees face similar risks and continued downward pressure on the share of homesale brokerage commission income retained by our franchisees (and not split with the independent sales agents) could negatively impact our franchisees' view of our value proposition. As a result, we may fail to attract new franchisees, expiring franchisees may not renew their agreements with us, or we may be required to offer reduced royalty fee or increased incentive arrangements to new and existing franchisees, all of which have occurred from time to time, and any of which could result in a further reduction in royalty or other fees paid to us.\n\nInsufficient inventory could continue to have a negative impact on homesale transaction sides and other homesale services, including title and mortgage.\n\nOverall housing inventory levels have been a persistent industry-wide concern for years, in particular in certain highly sought-after geographies and at lower price points. Insufficient inventory levels generally have a negative impact on homesale transaction sides and can contribute to a reduction in housing affordability, which could result in some potential home buyers deferring entry into the residential real estate market. Declines in homesale sides have also had a negative impact on other homesale services, including title and mortgage. Additional inventory pressure arises from potential home sellers choosing to stay with their lower mortgage rate rather than sell their home, periods of slow or decelerated new housing construction, real estate models that purchase homes for rental use (rather than resale), and alternative competitors. \n\n25\n\n\nPotential changes to industry rules and practices could further complicate inventory constraints. For example, changes to the Clear Cooperation Policy could, among other things, reduce the availability of broadly listed properties, leading to more unlisted inventory and potentially limiting access to comprehensive housing market data.\n\nWe believe constraints in home inventory levels have contributed to a decline in homesale transaction sides and this factor may continue to have an adverse impact on the number of homesale transaction sides closed by Franchise Group and Owned Brokerage Group (and on other homesale services, including title and mortgage), which could materially adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial results. \n\nStrategic and Operational Risks\n\nOur ability to generate revenue and grow earnings is significantly dependent upon our and our franchisees' ability to attract and retain productive independent sales agents and on our ability to attract and retain franchisees.\n\nIf we and our franchisees, as applicable, are unable to successfully maintain and grow the base of productive independent sales agents, independent sales agent teams, and other agent-facing talent at our company owned and franchisee brokerages (or if we or they fail to replace departing successful sales agents with similarly productive sales agents) or if we are unable to grow our base of franchisees, we may be unable to maintain or grow revenues or earnings and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nA variety of factors impact our ability to attract and retain independent sales agents and franchisees, including but not limited to, intense competition from other brokerages as well as companies employing technologies or alternative models intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models; our ability to develop and deliver compelling products and services to independent sales agents and franchisees; our ability to generate high-quality leads to independent sales agents and franchisees; and our ability to adopt and implement commission plans (or pricing model structures) that are attractive to such agents (or such franchisees). Changes to industry rules or practices that reduce the percentage of home buyers or home sellers using an agent or broker in their homesale transactions or change the broker commission structure, which could arise from litigation and injunctive relief, regulatory or governmental actions, market forces, changing competitive dynamics or consumer preferences, locally or industry-wide, could also reduce the overall number of independent sales agents in the industry and further increase competition for productive independent sales agents. \n\nOur franchisees face the same challenges with respect to productive sales agent recruitment and retention as well as other market pressures generally facing the industry (such as margin compression). When a franchisee is unable to maintain or grow their affiliated sales agent base, the homesale transaction volume generated by such franchisee is more likely to decline. Such declines have and could continue to result in a decline in our royalty revenues, which could be material. In addition, franchisees have and may continue to seek lower royalty rates or higher incentives from us to moderate market pressures. Such pressures also induce certain franchisees to exit our franchisee system from time to time. If franchisees, in particular multiple larger franchisees, fail to renew their franchise agreements (or otherwise leave our franchise system), or if we induce franchisees to renew these agreements through lower royalty rates or higher incentives (as we have done from time to time), then our royalty revenues may decrease, and profitability may be lower than in the past. \n\nIf we fail to successfully enhance our value proposition, we may fail to attract new or retain productive independent sales agents or franchisees, resulting in a reduction in commission income and royalty fees paid to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we are successful in our recruitment and retention efforts, any additional revenue generated may not offset the related expenses we incur. \n\nWe may not successfully develop or procure products, services and technology that support our strategic initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to continuously develop and improve, or procure, products, services, and technologies that are compelling to independent sales agents, franchisees and consumers. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of our company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop product, service and technology offerings to meet their needs as well as those that will further complement our businesses. We will continue to prioritize certain offerings over others and our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on opportunities that could later prove to have greater commercial potential.\n\nWe may incur unforeseen expenses in the development or procurement of, or enhancements to, products, services and technology, or may experience competitive delays in introducing new offerings as quickly as we would like. We also rely on third parties for the provision or development of certain key products that we offer to affiliated independent sales agents and \n\n26\n\n\nbrokers. Delays or other issues with such products could have a negative impact on our recruitment and retention efforts, which may be material. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry for technology talent may impact our ability to attract and retain employees involved in developing our technology products and services.\n\nFurthermore, the investment and pace of technology development continue to accelerate across the industry, creating risk in the relative timing and attractiveness of our technology products and services, and there can be no assurance that the targeted end user will choose to use the products, services or technologies we may develop or that they will find such products, services and technologies compelling. We may be unable to maintain and scale the technology underlying our offerings, which could negatively impact the security and availability of our services and technologies. In addition, our competitors may develop or make available products, services or technologies that are preferred by agents, franchisees and/or consumers. Further, third parties utilizing our platform may not create tools that meet the needs of agents and franchisees in a timely or effective manner, or at all.\n\nIn addition, we have made and may continue to make strategic investments in companies and joint ventures developing products, services and technologies that we believe will support our strategy and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these investments or be able to recover our investments in such companies and joint ventures and such offerings may not become available to us or may become available to our competitors. \n\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our value proposition to affiliated agents and franchisees, the productivity of independent sales agents, our appeal to consumers, or our ability to capture increased economics associated with homesale transactions, which in turn could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads for affiliated independent sales agents and franchisees, which could materially adversely impact our revenues and profitability. \n\nA key component of our long-term strategy is focused on providing affiliated independent sales agents and franchisees with high-quality leads. We expect that significant time and effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of, and consumer participation in, partner programs or products and services that are intended to aid in lead generation. Even if we are successful in these efforts, such partner programs or products may not generate a meaningful number of high-quality leads, which could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain independent sales agents and attract and retain new franchisees and could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability, including as a result of the loss of downstream revenues at our franchise, brokerage and title businesses as well as our minority-owned mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures. In addition, our lead generation business is highly regulated, subject to complex federal and state laws (including RESPA and similar state laws as well as state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers), and subject to changing economic and political influences as well as changing industry rules and practices. A change in such laws, more restrictive interpretations of such laws by administrative, legislative or other governmental bodies, or changes to industry rules or practices that may result in leads being less valuable could have a material adverse effect on this business. \n\nWe may be unable to achieve or maintain cost savings and other benefits from our cost-saving initiatives, including simplifying and modernizing our business.\n\nWe continue to engage in business optimization and cost-saving initiatives that focus on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the cost structure of each of the Company's businesses. These actions are designed to improve client service levels across each of the business units while enhancing the Company's profitability and incremental margins. We may not be able to achieve these improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations or cost structure and, even if achieved, any cost-savings realized may not be sufficient to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, including those related to employees and leases, or to offset continued pressure from the increasing share of homesale brokerage commission income paid to affiliated independent sales agents or other actual or potential changes to industry rules or practices. In connection with our implementation of cost-savings, simplification and modernization initiatives we may experience disruptions in our business, including with respect to agent and franchisee recruitment and retention efforts and the diversion of a significant amount of management and employee time and focus. We also may incur greater costs than currently anticipated to achieve these savings and we may not be able to maintain these cost savings and other benefits in the future. Failure to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position (including with respect to the recruitment and retention of franchisees and production independent sales agents), business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n27\n\n\nOur company-owned brokerage operations are subject to geographic and high-end real estate market risks, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group operates real estate brokerage offices located in and around large U.S. metropolitan areas where competition for independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is particularly intense. Local and regional economic conditions in these locations at times differ materially from prevailing conditions in other parts of the country. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Owned Brokerage Group realized approximately 23% of its revenues from California, 21% from the New York metropolitan area and 13% from Florida, which in the aggregate totals approximately 57% of its revenues. Downturns in the residential real estate market or economic conditions that are concentrated in these regions (including as a result of severe weather events or natural disasters, such as the wildfires recently impacting California), or in other geographic concentration areas for us, result in declines in Owned Brokerage Group's total gross commission income and profitability that are disproportionate to the downturn experienced throughout the U.S. In addition, given the significant geographic overlap of our title, escrow and settlement services business with our company owned brokerage offices, such regional declines affecting our company owned brokerage operations generally have a disproportionate adverse effect on our title, escrow and settlement services business and mortgage origination joint venture as well. These factors have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our financial results and such impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group also has a significant concentration of transactions at the higher end of the U.S. real estate market and in high-tax states. Accordingly, the effects of certain state and local tax reform may have a deeper impact on our business. A shift in transactions from high-tax to low-tax states or in Owned Brokerage Group's mix of property transactions from high range to lower and middle range homes would adversely affect the average price of Owned Brokerage Group's closed homesales. Such a shift, absent an increase in transactions, would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Due to Owned Brokerage Group's concentration in high-end real estate, its business may also be adversely impacted by capital controls imposed by foreign governments that restrict the amount of capital individual citizens may legally transfer out of their countries. In addition, Owned Brokerage Group continues to face heightened competition for both homesale transactions and high performing independent sales agents because of its prominent position in the higher end housing markets.\n\nMoreover, Owned Brokerage Group also has relationships with developers in select major cities (in particular, New York City) to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments. The irregular volume and timing of new development closings may contribute to uneven financial results and deceleration in the building of new housing may result in lower unit sales in the new development market, which has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the revenue generated by Owned Brokerage Group and our profitability.\n\nThe businesses in which we, our joint ventures, and our franchisees operate are intensely competitive and we may not be able to effectively compete.\n\nWe face intense competition in the residential real estate services business, in particular with respect to productive independent sales agent recruitment and retention. Aggressive competition for the affiliation of independent sales agents continues to make recruitment and retention efforts at both Franchise Group and Owned Brokerage Group challenging, in particular with respect to more productive sales agents and in the densely populated metropolitan areas in which we operate. The competitive environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our market share and may continue to put pressure on our and our franchisees' operating margins and financial results.\n\nCompetitive pressures for independent sales agents come from a variety of sources, including traditional brokerages as well as newer brokerage models, including discount brokerages, virtual brokerages (and other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income) as well as brokerages that provide certain services to agents and agent teams, but with branding focused on the name of the agent or agent team, rather than the brokerage brand. \n\nIncreasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed. In addition, certain types of compensation that may be appealing to independent sales agents, such as equity awards, may not be available to us at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThese competitive market factors also impact our franchisees and such franchisees have and may continue to seek reduced royalty fee arrangements or other incentives from us to offset the continued business pressures on such franchisees, which has and could continue to result in a reduction in royalty fees paid to us or other associated costs.\n\n28\n\n\nWe expect this highly competitive environment to continue and, accordingly, we and our affiliated franchisees may fail to attract and retain independent sales agents if we are unable to compete in a profitable and effective manner with a combination of continuously improved value propositions and/or commission plans that appeal to a broad base of independent sales agents.\n\nIf we or our franchisees fail to attract and retain productive independent sales agents or we or they fail to replace departing successful independent sales agents with similarly productive independent sales agents, the gross commission income generated by our company owned brokerages and franchises may decrease, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. \n\nOur franchise business is also highly competitive. Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to franchise with one of our competitors or operate as an independent broker. Competitors may offer franchisees whose franchise agreements are expiring or prospective franchisees products and services similar to ours at rates that are lower than we charge or a combination of products and services that are more attractive to the franchisee. We also face the risk that brokers may not enter into or renew franchise agreements with us for a variety of reasons, including because they believe they can compete effectively in the market without the need to license a brand of a franchisor and receive services offered by a franchisor, because competitive costs associated with agent recruitment makes affiliation with a brand economically challenging, or because they may believe that their business will be more attractive to a prospective purchaser without the existence of a franchise relationship. Additional competitive pressure is provided by regional and local franchisors as well as franchisors offering different franchise models or services.\n\nWe expect that the trend of increasing incentives will continue in the future in order to attract, retain, and help grow certain franchisees. For example, to remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees, we have taken and may continue to take actions that result in increased costs to us (such as increased sales incentives to franchisees) or decreased royalty payments to us (such as a reduction in or cap on the fees we charge our franchisees, including lower royalty rates). Taking into account competitive factors, from time to time, we have and may continue to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms. If we fail to successfully offer franchisees compelling value propositions, we may fail to attract new franchisees and expiring franchisees may not renew their agreements with us, resulting in a reduction in royalty fees paid to us. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and growth opportunities.\n\nWe and our franchisees also face substantial competition from non-traditional market participants. Competition in our related businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures is also intense. See \"Item 1.—Business—Competition\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nConsumer preferences for the home buying and selling experience may change more quickly than we can adapt our businesses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants and a growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions, including new entrants that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models, minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process, and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model.\n\nSome of these models may have less exposure to risks related to the continued rise of the sales agent's share of commission income generated by homesale transactions, as they are less reliant on agent services, or may operate under a lower cost structure, such as virtual or discount brokerages. Changes to industry rules or policies and/or the introduction of disruptive products and services may also result in an increase in the number of transactions that do not utilize the services of sales agents, including for sale by owner transactions.\n\nThe significant size of the U.S. real estate market has continued to attract outside capital investment in disruptive competitors that seek to access a portion of this market, which has and is likely to continue to contribute to the competitive environment. Meaningful gains in market share by these alternative models and/or the introduction of other industry-disruptive competitors may adversely impact our market share and reduce transaction volume for homesales as well as for other Company services if we are unable to introduce competing products and services that are more attractive to consumers in a timely manner. A loss of market share or reduction in such transaction volume may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\n\n29\n\n\nListing aggregator concentration and market power creates, and is expected to continue to create, disruption in the residential real estate brokerage industry, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions, including expanding into the brokerage business, charging significant referral fees, charging listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. These actions divert and reduce the earnings of other industry participants, including our company owned and franchised brokerages. \n\nAggregators could expand their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry including, but not limited to:\n\n•setting up competing brokerages and/or businesses, which could include the capture of property listings, directing referrals to agents and brokers that share revenue with them, or the recruitment of agents or franchisees;\n\n•continuing to expand their offerings to include products (including agent tools) and services that are a part of or related to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us;\n\n•bundling their listing services with such other offerings;\n\n•broadening and/or increasing fees for their programs that charge brokerages and/or their affiliated sales agents fees including, referral, listing, display, advertising and related fees or introducing new fees for new or existing services;\n\n•not including our or our franchisees' listings on their websites;\n\n•controlling significant inventory and agent referrals, tying referrals to use of their products, and/or engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants;\n\n•leveraging their position to compel the use of their platforms exclusively, which may include requiring disclosure of competitively sensitive information;\n\n•aggregating consumer data from their listing sites and ancillary services for competitive advantage; \n\n•establishing oppressive contract terms, including with respect to data sharing requirements; \n\n•disintermediating our relationship with affiliated franchisees and independent sales agents; and/or \n\n•disintermediating the relationship between the sales agent and the buyers and sellers of homes, including through the promotion of products or services designed to replace the role of the sales agent in both buy side and sell side transactions. \n\nSuch tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our market share, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with franchisees, independent sales agents and consumers and our franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and consumers.\n\nOur financial results are affected by the operating results of our franchisees.\n\nFranchise Group receives revenue in the form of royalties, which are based on a percentage of gross commission income earned by our franchisees. Accordingly, the financial results of Franchise Group are dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees, in particular with respect to our largest franchisees. If industry trends or economic conditions worsen or do not improve or if one or more of our top performing franchisees become less competitive or leave our franchise system, Franchise Group's financial results may worsen and our royalty revenues may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, from time to time, we have had to increase our bad debt and note reserves, including with respect to the conversion notes or other note-backed funding we extend to eligible franchisees, which are forgiven ratably generally over the term of the franchise agreement upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds. We may also have to terminate franchisees due to non-payment. Moreover, the ownership model for some larger franchisees has shifted to control by private investor groups that are more likely to have a higher proportion of debt and may have different priorities than historic franchisee owners, which increases franchisee liquidity, termination and non-renewal risks and the risk that we may have to impair some or all of the conversion notes we have extended or may extend to these franchisees, which could materially adversely affect our financial results. \n\n30\n\n\nConsolidation among our top 250 franchisees puts pressure on our ability to renew or negotiate franchise agreements with favorable terms, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our royalty revenue.\n\nA significant majority of revenue at Franchise Group is generated from our top 250 franchisees, which have grown faster than our other franchisees through organic growth and market consolidation in recent years. The growing concentration in our top 250 franchisees puts pressure on our ability to renew or negotiate franchise agreements with favorable terms, including with respect to contractual royalty rates, sales incentives and covered geographies. In addition, such concentration increases risks related to the financial health of our franchisees as well as with respect to franchisee non-renewal or termination. Operational or liquidity issues that cause any of the largest franchisees to reduce or delay royalty payments or result in notes we have advanced to such franchisee to become impaired can have a significant adverse impact on the applicable brand as well as our business results. If the amount of gross commission income generated by our top 250 franchisees continues to grow at a quicker pace relative to our other franchisees, we would expect to continue to experience pressure on our royalty revenue due to increased volume incentives, lower negotiated rates, and other incentives earned by such franchisees, all of which directly impact our royalty revenue.\n\nNegligence or intentional actions of our franchisees and their independent sales agents could harm our business.\n\nOur franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages) are independent business operators and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Our franchisees may not successfully operate a real estate brokerage business in a manner consistent with industry standards or may not affiliate with effective independent sales agents or employees. If our franchisees or their independent sales agents were to engage in negligent or intentional misconduct or provide diminished quality of service to customers, our image and reputation may suffer materially, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Negligent or improper actions involving our franchisees or master franchisees, including regarding their relationships with independent sales agents, clients and employees, have led, and may in the future also lead to direct claims against us based on theories of vicarious liability, negligence, joint operations and joint employer liability which, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.\n\nAdditionally, franchisees and their independent sales agents (including those handling properties for our relocation operations) may engage or be accused of engaging in unlawful or tortious acts or failing to make necessary disclosures under federal and state law. Such acts or the accusation of such acts could harm our brands' image, reputation and goodwill or compromise our relocation operations' relationships with clients. In addition, for certain types of claims, such as claims under antitrust laws, the sales of our franchisees are included in the calculation of liability and can materially increase the magnitude of the potential liability we may face in such actions.\n\nNegligence or intentional actions of independent sales agents engaged by our company owned brokerages could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to liability.\n\nOur company-owned brokerage operations rely on the performance of independent sales agents. If the independent sales agents were to provide lower quality services to our customers or engage in negligent or intentional misconduct, our image and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we could also be subject to litigation and regulatory claims arising out of their performance of brokerage or ancillary services, which if adversely determined, could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nWe do not own two of our brands and difficulties in the business or changes in the licensing strategy of, or disagreements or complications in our relationship with, the brand owners could disrupt our business and/or negatively reflect on the brand and the brand value.\n\nThe Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brands are owned by the companies that founded these brands. Under separate long-term license agreements, we are the exclusive party licensed to run brokerage services in residential real estate under those brands, whether through our franchisees or our company owned operations. Our future operations and performance with respect to these brands requires the successful protection of those brands. Any disagreements or complications in our relationship with, or difficulties in the business or changes in the licensing strategy of, the brand owners could disrupt our business and/or negatively reflect on the brand and the brand value. For additional information see \"Item 1.—Business—Franchise Group—Intellectual Property\".\n\n31\n\n\nContinued reductions in the global spending on relocation services or a cessation or reduction in the volume of business generated from multiple significant relocation clients, or the loss of our largest real estate benefit program client could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\nMany of the general residential housing trends impacting our businesses that derive revenue from homesales also impact our relocation services business. Additionally, global corporate spending on relocation services has continued to shift to lower cost relocation benefits. Even if general residential housing trends begin to improve, spending on relocation services may not return to former levels, which would negatively impact the revenue and operating results of our relocation operations.\n\nContracts with our real estate benefit program clients and relocation clients are generally terminable at any time at the option of the client, do not require such client to maintain any level of business with us and are non-exclusive. Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated. If our largest real estate benefit program client or multiple significant relocation clients ceased or materially reduced volume under their contract with us, our revenue (including downstream revenue at Franchise, Owned Brokerage and Title Groups) and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\n\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information or litigation or claims arising from such incidents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations. \n\nWe face growing risks and costs related to cybersecurity threats to our operations, our data and customer, franchisee, employee and independent sales agent data, including but not limited to:\n\n•the failure or significant disruption of our operations from various causes, including human error, computer malware, ransomware, insecure software, zero-day threats, threats to or disruption of joint venture partners or of third-party vendors who provide critical services, or other events related to our critical information technologies and systems;\n\n•the increasing level and sophistication of cybersecurity attacks, including distributed denial of service attacks, data theft, fraud or malicious or negligent acts on the part of trusted insiders, social engineering, or other unlawful tactics aimed at compromising the systems and data of our businesses, officers, employees, franchisees and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and their customers (including via systems not directly controlled by us, such as those maintained by our franchisees, affiliated independent sales agents, joint venture partners and third party service providers, including our third-party relocation service providers); and\n\n•the reputational, business continuity and financial risks associated with a loss of data or material data breach (including unauthorized access to, or destruction or corruption of, our proprietary business information or personal information of our customers, employees and independent sales agents), the transmission of computer malware, cyberattacks, or the diversion of homesale transaction closing funds.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers, our franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and our relocation operations collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients as well as personal information, sensitive financial information and other confidential information of our employees, customers and the customers of our franchisee and company owned brokerage sales agents.\n\nThird parties, including vendors or suppliers that provide essential services for our global operations, could also be a source of security risk to us if they experience a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. We increasingly rely on third-party data processing, storage providers, and critical infrastructure services, including but not limited to cloud solution providers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and with respect to information collected and stored by our third-party service providers, we are reliant upon their security procedures, which may not be as substantial as our own procedures. A breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked.\n\nMoreover, the real estate industry is actively targeted by cyber-attacker attempts to conduct electronic fraudulent activity directed at participants in real estate services transactions. These attacks, when successful, can result in fraud, including wire fraud related to the diversion of home sale transaction funds, or other harm, which could result in significant claims and reputational damage to us, our brands, franchisees, and independent sales agents and could also result in material increases in our operational costs. Further, these threats to our business may be wholly or partially beyond our control as our franchisees as well as our customers, franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents and their customers, joint venture partners and third-party service providers may use e-mail, computers, smartphones and other devices and systems that are outside of our security control environment. In addition, real estate transactions involve the transmission of funds by the buyers and sellers of real estate, and consumers or other service providers selected by the \n\n32\n\n\nconsumer may be the subject of direct cyber-attacks that result in the fraudulent diversion of funds, notwithstanding efforts we have taken to educate consumers with respect to these risks.\n\nCybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could result in, among other things, the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical systems, data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personal information and financial information) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include regulatory violations of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, reputational damage, loss of market value, litigation with third parties (which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability), diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs (that may include liability for stolen assets or information), which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness and results of operations.\n\nOur security systems and IT infrastructure may not adequately protect against all potential security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other unauthorized access to personal information, including ransomware incidents. We, our third-party service providers, franchisees, franchisee and company owned brokerage independent sales agents, and joint venture partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents. Cyberattacks have led and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, investigating, mitigating, insuring against and remediating these incidents and risks, as well as any related attempted or actual fraud. Our corporate errors and omissions and cybersecurity breach insurance, or that of applicable third parties, may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\n\nMoreover, we are required to comply with growing laws and regulations both in the United States and in other countries where we do business that regulate cybersecurity, privacy and related matters. With an increased percentage of our business occurring virtually, there is an increased risk of a potential violation of these expanding laws and regulations. Any significant violations of such laws and regulations could result in the loss of new or existing business, litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines and/or penalties (which may not be covered by cybersecurity breach insurance) and damage to our reputation. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nThe failure of third-party vendors or partners could result in harm to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe engage with third-party vendors and partners in a variety of ways, ranging from strategic collaborations and joint ventures and product development to running key internal operational processes and critical client systems. In many instances, these third parties are in direct contact with our customers, independent sales agents and franchisees in order to deliver services on our behalf or to fulfill their role in the applicable collaboration. In some instances, these third parties may be in possession of personal information of our customers or employees. In other instances, these third parties may play a critical role in developing products and services central to our business strategy. For example, we have partnered with a strategic third party to provide our product suite to affiliated agents, brokerages and franchisees, and these products form an important part of our value proposition to such parties. In addition, we have engaged with another strategic third-party partner on key software development projects and have other strategic projects in place with other third parties. Our third-party vendors and partners may encounter difficulties in the provision of required deliverables or may fail to provide us with timely services, which may delay our projects, and also may make decisions that may harm us or that are contrary to our best interests, including by pursuing opportunities outside of the applicable Company project or program, to the detriment of such project or program.\n\nIf our third-party partners or vendors were to fail to perform as we expect, fail to appropriately manage risks, provide diminished or delayed services to our customers, experience operational or liquidity concerns (whether related to market downturns or other factors), or face cybersecurity breaches of their information technology systems, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, our operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected, in particular with respect to any such failures related to the provision or development of key products. Depending on the function involved, vendor or third-party application failure or error may lead to increased costs, business disruption, distraction to management, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, effects on financial reporting, loss of customers, damage to our reputation, or litigation, regulatory claims and/or remediation costs (including claims based on theories of breach of contract, vicarious liability, negligence or failure to comply with laws and regulations). Third-party vendors and partners may also fail to maintain or keep adequate levels of insurance, which could result in a loss to us or expose us to litigation. In addition, although we have a Vendor Code of Conduct, we may be subject to the consequences of fraud, bribery, or misconduct by employees of our vendors, which could result in significant financial or reputational harm. The actions of our third-party vendors and unaffiliated third-party \n\n33\n\n\ndevelopers are beyond our control. We face the same risks with respect to subcontractors that might be engaged by our third-party vendors and partners.\n\nWe are reliant upon information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness.\n\nOur ability to leverage our technology and data scale is critical to our long-term strategy. Our business, including our ability to attract employees and independent sales agents, increasingly depends upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems (cloud solutions, mobile and otherwise) utilized for communications, marketing, productivity tools, training, lead generation, records of transactions, business records (employment, accounting, tax, etc.), procurement, call center operations and administrative systems. The operation of these technologies and systems is dependent upon third-party technologies, systems and services for which there are no assurances of continued or uninterrupted availability and support by the applicable third-party vendors on commercially reasonable terms. We also cannot assure that we will be able to continue to effectively operate and maintain our information technologies and systems. In addition, our information technologies and systems are expected to require refinements and enhancements on an ongoing basis, and we expect that advanced new technologies and systems will continue to be introduced. We may not be able to obtain such new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, and we may not be able to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future.\n\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nIn an effort to increase efficiency, improve quality, improve agent and customer experience and decrease risk, we are utilizing innovative technologies, processes and techniques, including AI, in internal business processes and in our products and services. \n\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop products and services that anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by developments in technology, including technologies based on AI, machine learning, generative AI and large language models. If we are unable to effectively utilize these technologies in our products and services, it could adversely affect our value proposition to affiliated agents and franchisees, the productivity of independent sales agents, our appeal to consumers, or our ability to capture increased economics associated with homesale transactions, which in turn could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, applicable law, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could negatively impact our cost saving initiatives, including streamlining and modernizing our business. Failure to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position (including with respect to the recruitment and retention of productive independent sales agents and franchisees), business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFinally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face an evolving regulatory landscape. These initiatives may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, industry self-regulation standards or other complications, including those associated with potential defects in the design and development of the technologies used to automate processes; misapplication of technologies; the reliance on data, rules or assumptions that may prove inadequate; information security vulnerabilities; and failure to meet customer expectations, among others. Moreover, AI may give rise to litigation risk, including potential bias, intellectual property or privacy liability. Similar risks arise in connection with the use of AI by our third-party vendors or partners. Any of these factors may cause us to experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability, new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, and to incur additional costs to resolve such issues.\n\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our existing or future joint ventures or strategic partnerships.\n\nWe have entered into several important strategic joint ventures with third party partners. In some of these joint ventures, such as Guaranteed Rate Affinity and our Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture, we hold a minority stake and, while we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest. \n\nThere are inherent risks to joint ventures, including execution risks that could arise if our strategic priorities do not align with those of our partners. There can be no assurance that such ventures (or products offered by such ventures) will be \n\n34\n\n\nsuccessful or will operate as intended. Our current or future joint venture partners may make decisions which may harm the joint venture or are contrary to our best interests, including by pursuing opportunities outside of the joint venture. Our joint ventures generally are not exclusive and our joint venture partners could expand existing relationships with competitors or pursue relationships with other competitors to our detriment.\n\nAdditionally, even when we hold a minority interest in a joint venture, improper actions by the joint venture or our joint venture partners may also lead to direct claims against us based on theories of vicarious liability, negligence, joint operations and joint employer liability, which, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our reputation and subject us to liability for their actions. \n\nEach of our existing joint ventures faces risks specific to their business as well, including regulatory changes, consumer trends and preferences and other market conditions. For example, our mortgage origination joint venture has been materially adversely affected by high mortgage interest rates, high levels of competition, decreases in operating margins and lower gain-on-sale margins. \n\nIn addition, our joint ventures or our joint venture partners could face operational or liquidity risks due to market downturns or other factors legal investigations that may arise. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our earnings and dividends from the applicable joint venture or our results of operations. \n\nFailure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all; our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations. In addition, the success of any future acquisition strategy we may pursue will depend upon our ability to fund such acquisitions given our total outstanding indebtedness, find suitable acquisition candidates on favorable terms and for target companies to find our acquisition proposals more favorable than those made by other competitors. If an acquisition or majority-held joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations (including our internal controls and compliance environment), or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\nOur liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the substantial interest expense on our debt obligations.\n\nWe are significantly encumbered by our debt obligations. As of December 31, 2024, our total debt, excluding our securitization obligations, was $2,540 million (without giving effect to outstanding letters of credit). As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and is therefore not available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, technology, discretionary principal debt repayment or open market debt repurchases, share repurchases, dividends or future business opportunities. Our liquidity position has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the substantial interest expense on our debt obligations. In addition, a portion of our interest expense arises from variable interest rate debt, and such expenses may significantly increase if interest rates increase. Risks associated with our debt obligations are heightened during industry downturns or broader recessions that decrease our revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations.\n\nOur significant indebtedness and interest obligations could prevent us from meeting our obligations under our debt instruments and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business or pursue growth opportunities, react to changes in the economy or our industry, or incur additional borrowings under our existing facilities.\n\nOur leverage could have important consequences, including the following:\n\n•it could cause us to be unable to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under our Senior Secured Credit Facility;\n\n35\n\n\n•it could cause us to be unable to meet our debt service requirements under our debt agreements or meet our other financial obligations;\n\n•it may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings under our existing facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility, to refinance or restructure our indebtedness, or to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\n•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have no or less debt;\n\n•it may cause a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings;\n\n•it may limit our ability to repurchase shares or declare dividends;\n\n•it may limit our ability to attract acquisition candidates or to complete future acquisitions;\n\n•it may cause us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business, or may cause us to be unable to invest in strategic initiatives that are important to our growth; and\n\n•it may limit our ability to motivate, attract and retain key personnel.\n\nA material decline in our ability to generate EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility, could result in our failure to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility), which would result in an event of default if we fail to remedy or avoid a default as permitted under the applicable debt arrangement. \n\nOur debt risk may also be increased as a result of competitive pressures or changes to industry rules or practices that reduce margins and free cash flow. If our EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis were to decline and/or we were to incur additional first lien senior secured debt (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility), our ability to borrow the full capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility (without refinancing secured debt into unsecured debt) could be limited as we must maintain compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Any inability to borrow sufficient funds to operate our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nRestrictive covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and indentures governing the Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes may limit the manner in which we operate.\n\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes contain, and any future indebtedness we may incur may contain, various negative covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\n•pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\n•repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\n•make loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\n•receive dividends or other payment from certain of our subsidiaries;\n\n•enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\n•create liens;\n\n•merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\n•transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and\n\n•prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness.\n\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\n\nAn event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our other material indebtedness would adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy obligations under our indebtedness.\n\nIf we are unable to comply with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant under the Senior Secured Credit Facility due to a material decline in our ability to generate EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) or otherwise or if we are unable to comply with other restrictive covenants under those agreements or the \n\n36\n\n\nindentures governing our Unsecured Notes and 7.00% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes and we fail to remedy or avoid a default as permitted under the applicable debt arrangement, there would be an \"event of default\" under such arrangement.\n\nOther events of default include, without limitation, nonpayment of principal or interest, material misrepresentations, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain material judgments, change of control, and cross-events of default on material indebtedness as well as, under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, failure to obtain an unqualified audit opinion by 90 days after the end of any fiscal year. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders:\n\n•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\n•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable;\n\n•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\n•could prevent us from making payments on the Unsecured Notes, any of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing such notes or our Apple Ridge Funding LLC securitization program.\n\nIf we were unable to repay the amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders and holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral granted to secure those debt arrangements. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure such indebtedness. If the lenders under those debt arrangements accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our other indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance or restructure such indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing our Unsecured Notes, the trustee or holders of 25% of the outstanding applicable notes could elect to declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on such notes to be due and payable. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe have substantial indebtedness that will mature (or may spring forward) in 2026 and we may not be able to refinance or restructure any such debt on terms as favorable as those of currently outstanding debt, or at all.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $403 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in 2026 (excluding our securitization obligations) and an additional $490 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility due in 2027, which may be subject to earlier springing maturity in 2026. \n\nWe consistently evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions with respect to our debt, including restructuring our debt or repaying or refinancing certain tranches of our indebtedness and extending maturities, among other potential alternatives. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations and 'most favored nation' provisions applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents. The high-yield market may not be accessible to companies with our debt profile, and such or other financing alternatives may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any future indebtedness may impose various additional restrictions and covenants on us which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Refinancing or restructuring debt at a higher cost would affect our operating results. We could also issue public or private placements of our common stock or preferred stock or convertible notes, any of which could, among other things, dilute our current stockholders and materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nThe exchangeable note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock. \n\nConcurrent with the offering of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, we entered into exchangeable note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with certain counterparties (the \"Option Counterparties\"). The exchangeable note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon exchange of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of exchanged notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\n\nThe Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling the common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Exchangeable Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to an exchange of the notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\n\n37\n\n\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the exchangeable note hedge transactions. \n\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of such Option Counterparties may default under the exchangeable note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the exchangeable note hedge transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any Option Counterparty.\n\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future.\n\nOur indebtedness has been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned to us or our indebtedness will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any downgrade , suspension or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency (or any anticipated downgrade, suspension or withdrawal) as well as any actual or anticipated placement on negative outlook by a rating agency could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to refinance or restructure our debt or obtain additional debt financing in the future.\n\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, $490 million of our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility was at variable rates of interest thereby exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.\n\nWe may be unable to continue to securitize certain of the relocation assets of Cartus, which may adversely impact our liquidity.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, $140 million of securitization obligations were outstanding through special purpose entities monetizing certain assets of Cartus under one lending facility. We have provided a performance guaranty which guarantees the obligations of Cartus and its subsidiaries, as originator and servicer under the Apple Ridge securitization program. Our significant debt obligations may limit our ability to incur additional borrowings under our existing securitization facilities. The securitization markets have experienced, and may again experience, significant disruptions, which may have the effect of increasing our cost of funding or reducing our access to these markets in the future.\n\nIn addition, the Apple Ridge securitization facility contains terms which if triggered may result in a termination or limitation of new or existing funding under the facility and/or may result in a requirement that all collections on the assets be used to pay down the amounts outstanding under such facility. If securitization financing is not available to us for any reason, we could be required to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, which would adversely impact our liquidity, or we may be required to find additional sources of funding which may be on less favorable terms or may not be available at all.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\nAdverse developments or resolutions in litigation filed against us or against affiliated agents, franchisees or our joint ventures, may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs described in Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report (\"Note 15\"), we are a party to material litigation (including certified and putative class actions) in the areas of antitrust and TCPA. While we have received the final court approval of a nationwide settlement of sell-side antitrust class action litigation it has been appealed by several parties. Our settlement agreement with respect to our TCPA litigation remains subject to preliminary and final approval of the court. In addition, the buy-side antitrust case filed against us remains outstanding as do other antitrust cases. We cannot provide any assurances that results in this litigation or other litigation in which we are or may be named will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, either individually or in the aggregate.\n\n38\n\n\nLitigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties. Even cases brought by us can involve counterclaims asserted against us and even in matters in which we are not a named party, regulatory investigations and other litigation can have significant implications for us, particularly to the extent that changes in industry rules and practices can directly impact us. In addition, litigation and other legal matters, including class action lawsuits, multi-party litigation and regulatory proceedings challenging practices that have broad impact, can be costly to defend and, depending on the class size and claims, could be costly to settle.\n\nInsurance coverage may be unavailable for certain types of claims (including antitrust and TCPA litigation) and even where available, insurance carriers may dispute coverage for various reasons (including the cost of defense). Additionally, there is a deductible for each such case and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the losses the Company incurs.\n\nLikewise, we cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of other litigation and proceedings that have been or may be filed by or against us or against affiliated independent sales agents or franchisees or our joint ventures, and adverse developments and outcomes may materially harm our business and financial condition. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, the types of matters described under Note 15.\n\nAdverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions against companies unrelated to us or the real estate industry at large could impact our business practices and those of our franchisees in a manner that adversely impacts our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn general, we and other industry participants have seen an overall increase in significant litigation and regulatory scrutiny, and adverse outcomes and injunctive relief against industry participants, including industry associations and trade groups, could have a material adverse impact on us. Litigation, investigations, claims and regulatory proceedings against other participants in the residential real estate or relocation industry may impact the Company and its affiliated franchisees when the rulings or settlements in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry or business community and may generate litigation or investigations for the Company. Examples may include RESPA, worker classification, or antitrust and anti-competition claims, among others. For example, under the NAR Settlement, NAR agreed to certain practice changes including those discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\". Similarly, the Company may be impacted by litigation and other claims against companies in other industries, including litigation involving worker classification. To the extent plaintiffs are successful in these types of litigation matters, and we or our franchisees cannot distinguish our or their practices (or our industry’s practices), we and our franchisees could face significant liability and could be required to modify certain business relationships and/or practices, either of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges to industry rules or practices that prohibit, restrict or adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nAs described more fully below and \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\", we operate in a highly regulated industry. In addition, from time to time, certain industry practices have changed for a variety of reasons and may continue to evolve. For example, NAR recently agreed to certain practice changes, including among other things, prohibiting offers of compensation to buyer brokers from being made on listings on an MLS pursuant to the NAR Settlement discussed under \"Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis—Current Business and Industry Trends\".\n\nIndustry rules and practices, particularly those that mandate behavior by industry participants, have drawn increasing scrutiny and criticism, including from various industry participants as well as regulators and other government offices, both on a federal and state level, with particular focus on antitrust and competition. There can be no assurances as to whether the DOJ or FTC, their state counterparts, state or federal courts, or other federal, state or local governmental body will determine that any industry practices or developments have an anti-competitive effect on the industry or are otherwise proscribed. Any such determination could result in industry investigations, enforcement actions, changes in legislation, regulations, interpretations or regulatory guidance or other legislative or regulatory action or other actions, any of which could have the potential to result in additional limitations or restrictions on our business, cause material disruption to our business, result in judgments, settlements, penalties or fines (which may be material), or otherwise adversely affect us. For example, we believe that based on public statements made by the DOJ in filings, the DOJ has continued to focus on the manner in which broker commissions are communicated, negotiated and paid, including how MLSs and state associations are implementing the changes required by the NAR Settlement and potentially on broader restrictions or bans on offers of compensation. The scope of the DOJ's scrutiny may also expand to other industry rules or practices. \n\n39\n\n\nRules and practices that may be subject to future change (whether instigated by industry participants or otherwise) include, but are not limited to, the Clear Cooperation Policy, the rules mandating participation in state and national Realtor associations in order to post on the local MLS, the rules limiting access to lock-boxes used to facilitate property showings, the rules that limit display of co-mingled MLS and non-MLS listings and rules related to the communication or display of transaction terms, including with respect to commissions. \n\nThe consequences of future industry changes are unknown and may be varied. For example, changes to the Clear Cooperation Policy could, among other things, reduce the availability of broadly listed properties, leading to more unlisted inventory and potentially limiting access to comprehensive housing market data. Concurrently, evolving rules may reduce MLS or other participant obligations, further fragmenting the inventory of homes available for sale and disrupting the industry’s collaborative model. There is no recent industry experience with widespread use of offline exclusives and it is difficult to predict how consumers, brokerages, agents and franchisees will respond. Among other possibilities, it could result in increased competition for productive independent sales agents, increased industry consolidation due to a need for greater listing scale, and changes in consumer marketing. All of these impacts could adversely impact our operations, revenues, earnings and financial results. \n\nWe cannot assure you that changes in legislation, regulations, interpretations or regulatory guidance, enforcement priorities, litigation or the rules and policies of NAR, any MLSs and/or any state or local realtor association (or any resulting changes to competitive dynamics or consumer preferences, either alone or in combination with any of the foregoing), will not materially adversely impact the structure of the industry or the financial results of the Company, affiliated franchisees and/or other industry participants. Such impacts could include, but are not limited to, meaningful decreases in the average broker homesale commission rate, the average buy-side commission rate, the share of commission income received by us and our franchisees, the share of royalties we receive from our franchisees, or the percentage of home buyers or home sellers using an agent or broker in their homesale transactions. Additionally, such changes could result in the introduction or growth of certain competitive models, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, earnings and financial results.\n\nOur businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures and affiliated franchisees are highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations or in the interpretations or enforcement of such regulations could adversely affect our business.\n\nAll of our businesses and the businesses of our joint ventures as well as the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and subject to shifts in public policy, statutory interpretation and enforcement priorities of regulators and other government authorities as well as amendments to existing regulations and regulatory guidance and change to MLS and/or NAR rules and policies. We must comply with numerous laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information concerning laws and regulations impacting our business, including antitrust, competition and bribery laws, RESPA, worker classification and the TCPA, among others. \n\nEach of our businesses could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations, and more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations could increase responsibilities and duties to customers and franchisees and other parties and make compliance more difficult or expensive. A change in current laws could adversely affect our business. In addition, any adverse changes in regulatory interpretations, rules and laws that would place additional limitations or restrictions on affiliated transactions could have the effect of limiting or restricting collaboration among our businesses. We cannot assure you that future changes in legislation, regulations or interpretations will not adversely affect our business operations. \n\nRegulatory authorities also have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our financial condition or our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could limit our ability to renew current franchisees or sign new franchisees or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\nOur compliance efforts may result in increased expenses, diversion of management's time or changes to the manner in which we conduct our business. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws, regulations or interpretations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business. Likewise, all of the foregoing could adversely affect the businesses of our joint ventures or franchisees. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n40\n\n\nThere may be adverse financial and operational consequences to us and our franchisees if independent sales agents are reclassified as employees.\n\nAlthough the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations, and our affiliated franchisees by seeking to reclassify licensed sales agents as employees. Certain jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting standards that are significantly more restrictive than those historically used in wage and hour cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nSignificant determinations to reclassify sales agents as employees in the absence of available exemptions from minimum wage or overtime laws, including damages and penalties for prior periods (if assessed), could be disruptive to our business, constrain our operations in certain jurisdictions and could have a material adverse effect on the operational and financial performance of the Company.\n\nIf we fail to protect the privacy and personal information of our customers or employees, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation.\n\nRegulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs as a result of numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. These ongoing changes to privacy and cybersecurity laws also may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, we are required to comply with  numerous laws governing privacy and cybersecurity matters. See \"Item 1.—Business—Government and Other Regulations—Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations\" in this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nWe could also be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. These ongoing changes to privacy and cybersecurity laws also may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\nAny significant violations of privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations (including those involving joint ventures or our third-party vendors or partners) could result in the loss of new or existing business (including potential home buyers or sellers, our corporate relocation or real estate benefit program clients, their employees or members, franchisees, independent sales agents and lender channel clients), litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines, damages, and penalties and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. With an increased percentage of our business occurring virtually, there is an enhanced risk of a potential violation of the expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, while we disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, customer expectations or state, national and international regulations.\n\nThe occurrence of a significant claim in excess of our insurance coverage in any given period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations during the period.\n\nThe weakening or unavailability of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including through the loss of intellectual property we license.\n\nOur trademarks, trade names, domain names and other intellectual property rights are fundamental to our brands and our franchising business. The steps we take to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate and, in particular, we may not own all necessary registrations for our intellectual property. Applications we have filed to register our intellectual property may not be approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property rights without our authorization or independently developing \n\n41\n\n\ntechnology that is similar to ours. Also, third parties may own rights in similar trademarks. Any unauthorized or improper use of our intellectual property by third parties, including current or formerly affiliated franchisees or independent sales agents, could reduce our competitive advantages or otherwise harm our business and brands. If we had to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be costly, and we may not prevail. Our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may update intellectual property used in our business, which creates transition and increased expense.\n\nWe cannot be certain that our intellectual property does not and will not infringe issued intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation. Adverse outcomes in intellectual property litigation and proceedings could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of intellectual property that is subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights. We may be required to enter into licensing or consent agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all), or to pay damages or royalties or cease using certain service marks, trademarks, technology or other intellectual property.\n\nWe franchise our brands to franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our brands or our reputation. In addition, our license agreements for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brands are terminable by the respective licensor prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur and the loss of either of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nOther Business Risks\n\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.\n\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations (due to the risks reflected in this Annual Report or otherwise), we could incur impairment charges in the past (including as related to management's estimates with respect to the potential impact of the ongoing housing market downturn on our business), which would negatively impact our earnings. We have recognized significant non-cash impairment charges and we may be required to take additional such charges in the future, which may be material.\n\nWe could be subject to significant losses if banks do not honor our escrow and trust deposits.\n\nOur company owned brokerage business and our title, escrow and settlement services business act as escrow agents for numerous customers. As an escrow agent, we receive money from customers to hold until certain conditions are satisfied. Upon the satisfaction of those conditions, we release the money to the appropriate party. We deposit this money with various banks and while these deposits are not assets of the Company (and therefore excluded from our consolidated balance sheet), we remain contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits. These escrow and trust deposits totaled $518 million at December 31, 2024. The banks may hold a significant amount of these deposits in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit. If any of our depository banks were to become unable to honor any portion of our deposits, customers could seek to hold us responsible for such amounts and, if the customers prevailed in their claims, we could be subject to significant losses.\n\nChanges in accounting standards, subjective assumptions and estimates used by management related to complex accounting matters could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidance and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters, such as revenue recognition, lease accounting, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, valuation reserves, income taxes and fair value accounting, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management. Changes in these rules or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments made by management could significantly change our reported results.\n\n42\n\n\nOur international operations are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\n\nOur relocation services business operates worldwide and we have other international operations and relationships, including but not limited to international franchisees and master franchisees. Such operations and relationships are subject to risks that are not generally experienced by our U.S. operations and could result in losses against which we are not insured and have a negative impact on our profitability. Such risks include, but are not limited to, heightened exposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations (including those related to employees, privacy and data storage, and other compliance issues, including sanction programs), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and potential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S. In addition, the activities of franchisees and master franchisees outside of the U.S. are more difficult and more expensive to monitor and improper activities or mismanagement may be more difficult to detect.\n\nLoss or attrition among our senior executives or other key employees and our inability to develop our existing workforce and to recruit top talent could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees, our ability to develop the skills and talent of our workforce and our ability to recruit, retain and motivate top talent. Talent management has been and continues to be a strategic priority and our ability to recruit and retain our executive officers and key employees, including those with expertise in enterprise-wide transformation and relevant product and technology capabilities, is subject to numerous factors, including the compensation and benefits we pay. Our recruitment and retention efforts may be hindered by present or future restructurings or cost savings initiatives. The ongoing downturn in the real estate market and the uncertainties surrounding how the industry may evolve due to litigation and/or regulatory action may restrict our ability to offer competitive compensation which, in addition to the broader uncertainty and potential downsides in the broader real estate market, could hinder our recruitment and retention efforts or make it more difficult to motivate our existing employees. The increasing prevalence of virtual and remote-work arrangements adds additional competition for critical talent. Additionally, the advancement of federal or state laws or regulations seeking to prohibit or limit the use of non-compete clauses with workers could have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to internally develop or hire skilled executives and other critical positions, successfully plan for succession of employees holding key management positions, or if we encounter challenges associated with change management or the competitiveness of compensation actually realized by our executive officers and other key employees, our ability to continue to execute or evolve our strategy may be impaired and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nSevere weather events or natural or man-made disasters, including increasing severity or frequency of such events, or other catastrophic events (including public health crises) may disrupt our business and have an unfavorable impact on homesale activity and the activity levels of other Company services.\n\nOwned Brokerage Group has a significant concentration of offices and transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the U.S. real estate market, particularly the east and west coasts. Coastal areas, including California and Florida, are particularly subject to severe weather events (including hurricanes and flooding) and natural disasters. Increasingly, wildfires in the west have been difficult to contain and cover large areas. For example, in early 2025, California experienced significant wildfires. We are monitoring potential effects on the impacted markets and will continue to support our independent sales agents, franchisees and consumers.\n\nThe occurrence of a severe weather event or natural or man-made disaster can reduce the level and quality of home inventory and negatively impact the demand for homes in affected areas, which can disrupt local or regional real estate markets, delay the closing of homesale transactions and have an unfavorable impact on home prices, homesale transaction volume, relocation transactions, and title closing units. These effects may be compounded when the taxes or insurance costs associated with homeownership in the affected area are higher than average or the cost of such insurance materially increases in connect with the increasing frequency and severity of weather events or other disasters. Movements away from the use of title insurance in connection with rising affordability concerns could lead to declines in certain services offered by the Company or its joint venture operations.\n\nIn addition, we could incur damage, which may be significant, to our office locations as a result of severe weather events or natural disasters, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover such losses. More frequent and/or severe weather events and/or long-term shifts in climate patterns exacerbate these risks. Likewise, our business and operating results could suffer as the result of other catastrophic events, including public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. For example, the COVID-19 crisis contributed to material reductions in relocation volume and significant homesale transaction volume volatility in 2021. \n\n43\n\n\nIncreasing governmental regulation and scrutiny from investors, customers and regulators with respect to corporate sustainability practices and reporting may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing focus from certain investors, regulators and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. State and federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that expand mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as emissions and environmental/climate-related topics, human capital, labor and risk oversight, which could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, California enacted the California Climate Accountability Package, which is the first U.S. law to require certain companies with California operations to disclose greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks. Existing and proposed ESG-related regulations may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\n\nSome investors may use ESG factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our related policies are inadequate. In addition, certain relocation clients have required that we implement certain additional ESG procedures or standards in order to continue to do business with us and additional clients may impose such requirements in the future. Meeting these evolving expectations could be costly and failure (or perceived failure) to satisfy investor, client, consumer or other stakeholder expectations and standards, could also cause reputational harm to our business and brands.\n\nIn addition, we may face increased scrutiny related to any actions or positions we could be viewed as taking in this space.  We could be subjected to negative responses (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) by either proponents or detractors of any particular ESG-related topic, including activists and consumers, which could adversely affect our reputation and business.\n\nMarket forecasts and estimates, including our internal estimates, may prove to be inaccurate and, even if achieved, our business could fail to grow at similar rates.\n\nWe use forecasts and data from a wide variety of industry sources (including NAR, Fannie Mae and other independent sources) in addition to good faith estimates derived from management's knowledge of the industry to inform our own forecasts and estimates for key market trends. Forecasts regarding rates of home ownership, median sales price, volume of homesales, and other housing industry metrics are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ. Even if the markets in which we compete achieve the growth forecasted by an industry source like NAR or Fannie Mae, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. \n\nWe may incur substantial liabilities arising out of our legacy pension plan.\n\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan for which participation was frozen as of July 1, 1997; however, the plan is subject to minimum funding requirements. Although the Company to date has met its minimum funding requirements, the pension plan represents a liability on our balance sheet and will continue to require cash contributions from us, which may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. In addition, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our pension plan and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plan.\n\nWe are responsible for certain of Cendant's contingent and other corporate liabilities.\n\nAlthough we have resolved various Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities and have established reserves for most of the remaining unresolved claims of which we have knowledge, adverse outcomes from the unresolved Cendant liabilities for which Anywhere Group has assumed partial liability under the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of July 27, 2006 among Cendant, Anywhere Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport could be material with respect to our earnings or cash flows in any given reporting period.\n\n44\n\n\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\n\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\nThe market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, many of which are outside our control, including, but not limited to, those described above and the following:\n\n•our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\n•our business and/or financial guidance, any revisions to such guidance and/or failure to achieve results consistent with such guidance;\n\n•our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\n•future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market;\n\n•the incurrence of additional indebtedness or other adverse changes relating to our debt;\n\n•commencement of new, or adverse resolution of or developments in, legal or regulatory proceedings against the Company or the industry; \n\n•the public's reaction to announcements concerning our business or our competitors' businesses;\n\n•changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts covering our stock or if securities analysts cease publishing or publish unfavorable research about our business;\n\n•ratings changes or commentary by rating agencies on our debt;\n\n•press releases or other commentary by industry forecasters or other housing market participants;\n\n•market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy;\n\n•actual or potential changes in laws, regulations and legal and regulatory interpretations;\n\n•changes to industry rules or practices that actually or may potentially adversely alter policies, practices, rules or regulations governing the functioning of the residential real estate market;\n\n•changes in housing or mortgage finance markets or other housing fundamentals, including changes in interest and mortgage rates;\n\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\n•arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\n•actions of current or prospective stockholders (including activists or several top stockholders acting alone or together) that may cause temporary or speculative market perceptions, including market rumors and short selling activity in our stock; and\n\n•changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets.\n\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall or experience volatility and may expose us to litigation, including class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\n\nDelaware law and our organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\n\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\n•do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\n•delegate the sole power to a majority of the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;\n\n•provide the power to our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\n•authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\n•eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\n•prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\n45\n\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\n\nThe foregoing factors could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock and our investors' ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.\n\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.",
