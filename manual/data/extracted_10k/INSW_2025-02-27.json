      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nOUR BUSINESS\n\n​\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated in 1999, and its wholly owned subsidiaries own and operate a fleet of oceangoing vessels engaged primarily in the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products in the International Flag trade. Our vessel operations are organized into two segments: Crude Tankers and Product Carriers. At December 31, 2024, we owned or operated an International Flag fleet of 78 vessels (totaling an aggregate of 9.1 million dwt), consisting of VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax crude tankers, as well as LR2, LR1 and MR product carriers. In addition to our operating fleet of 78 vessels, six dual-fuel ready LR1 newbuilds are contracted for delivery to the Company between the second half of 2025 and third quarter of 2026, bringing the total operating and newbuild fleet to 84 vessels. The Marshall Islands is the principal flag of registry of our vessels. Additional information about our fleet, including its ownership profile, is set forth under “— Fleet Operations — Fleet Summary,” as well as on the Company’s website, www.intlseas.com. Neither our website nor the information contained on that site, or connected to that site, is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n​\n\nOur ultimate customers, including those of the commercial pools in which we participate, include major independent and state-owned oil companies, oil traders, refinery operators and international government entities. We generally charter our vessels to customers either for specific voyages at spot rates through the services of pools in which the Company participates, or for specific periods of time at fixed daily rates through time charters or bareboat charters. Spot market rates are highly volatile, while time charter and bareboat charter rates provide more predictable streams of TCE revenues because they are fixed for specific periods of time. For a more detailed discussion on factors influencing spot and time charter markets, see “— Fleet Operations — Commercial Management” below.\n\n​\n\n2024 IN REVIEW\n\n​\n\nIn 2024, we recorded our second best annual financial results since becoming an independent public company in 2016, as the 2024 results trailed only the very strong results achieved during 2023. Shipping revenues and TCE Revenues for 2024 were $1.0 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Approximately 53% of our TCE Revenues were generated from our Product Carriers segment and 47% from our Crude Tankers segment. Income from vessel operations decreased by $160.2 million to $455.2. million in 2024, from $615.4 million in 2023, primarily driven by lower average daily rates across most of INSW’s fleet sectors. We achieved an Adjusted EBITDA (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for definition) of $583.3 million in 2024 compared to $723.8 million in 2023. \n\n​\n\nIn addition, we continued to further enhance our strong balance sheet by increasing total liquidity to $632.2 million from $601.2 million at the end of 2023, and ended the year with 45% (i.e., 35 vessels) of our fleet unencumbered, a net loan to value ratio of 15.5%, and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 22.2%. We made approximately $338.8 million in capital investments for vessel and other property purchases, vessel improvements, vessel construction and drydocking. We also returned capital to our shareholders through cash dividends totaling $284.4 million and $25.0 million in repurchases of our common stock.  \n\n​\n\nDuring 2024, we continued to focus on (i) maximizing our fleet’s earning potential through safe and reliable operations, opportunistic charter-ins/charter-outs, and sales and purchases of vessels, (ii) building on our track record as a disciplined capital allocator, and (iii) executing transactions that would ultimately unlock the value of our shares to investors. \n\n​\n\nWe executed these goals during 2024 by: \n\n​\n\n●Building on our track record as a disciplined capital allocator\n\n​\n\noIn a cyclical business such as ours, we believe that capital allocation is not a formula embedded in a financial metric but levers that we pull at the right times in the cycle. We have a track record of buying vessel assets at low points, voluntarily decreasing our leverage and returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders.  \n\noWe paid out $309.4 million in returns to our shareholders during 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n1\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n●Maintaining our fleet optimization program: \n\n​\n\noWe sold one 2009-built MR and two 2008-built MRs, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $72 million after fees and commissions. We recognized total gains of approximately $41.3 million on these sales.\n\noWe purchased four 2015-built MRs and two 2014-built MRs en bloc for an aggregate price of $232 million.  Eighty-five percent of the purchase price consideration was funded from available liquidity and the balance of fifteen percent with the issuance of the Company’s common stock.  \n\noWe declared options to build two additional dual-fuel ready LR1 product carriers at the same shipyard where our other four newbuild LR1s were contracted. The six LR1s are contracted for delivery between the second half of 2025 and the third quarter of 2026. The total construction cost for the vessels will be approximately $359 million, which will be paid for through a combination of long-term financing and available liquidity.\n\noWe opportunistically locked in $83.2 million of minimum revenues (before reduction for brokerage commissions) on non-cancelable time charters for one LR2 and two MRs with charter expiry dates ranging from January 2027 to April 2027. At December 31, 2024, the remaining future minimum revenues under these charters (approximately $69.0 million), when aggregated with the remaining future minimum revenues (excluding any applicable profit share) under time charters entered into in previous years, totaled approximately $309.6 million. \n\noWe entered into an agreement under which we agreed to sell one 2010-built VLCC and one 2011-built VLCC for an aggregate sales price of $116.6 million and purchase three 2015-built MRs from the same counterparty for an aggregate purchase price of $119.5 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of $2.9 million. One of the MRs was delivered to the Company on December 30, 2024 and the sale and purchase transactions on the four remaining vessels closed between January and February 2025.\n\n  ​\n\n​\n\n●Executing a number of liquidity enhancing, deleveraging and financing diversification initiatives, including:\n\n​\n\noWe prepaid the outstanding principal balance of $20.3 million and terminated the ING Credit Facility. \n\noWe entered into an agreement to amend and extend our existing $750 Million Credit Facility, under which we had a remaining term loan balance of $94.6 million and undrawn revolver capacity of $257.4 million at March 31, 2024. The new agreement consists of a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “$500 Million Revolving Credit Facility”) that matures in January 2030. By entering into the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility we have (i) eliminated $19.5 million in mandatory quarterly debt repayments since the balance drawn on closing is not required to be repaid until maturity, (ii) reduced cash break evens by over $3,000 per day, (iii) extended the maturity profile of the facility from 2027 to 2030, and (iv) reduced future interest expense through a margin reduction of over 85 basis points.\n\n​\n\nSee Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Sources of Capital,” for further details on these financing transactions. \n\n​\n\n​\n\nOUR STRATEGY \n\n​\n\nOur primary objectives are to (i) maintain safe and reliable vessel operations that improves energy efficiency and reduces our environmental footprint; (ii) actively manage the size, age and composition of our fleet over the course of market cycles to increase investment returns and available capital; (iii) maximize cash flows through management of vessel employment in the spot market through our participation in a number of commercial pools and selective time charters; (iv) defend and grow the market share and profits of our asset light Crude Tankers Lightering business; (v) execute a disciplined yet flexible capital allocation strategy that is aligned with the shipping industry cycles by maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to use cash flow generation for opportunistic fleet investment, further de-levering that reduces cash break evens and/or interest costs and increases return to shareholders; and (vi) enter into value-creating transactions. The key elements of our strategy are:\n\n​\n\nGenerate strong cash flows through a blend of spot market and period market exposure\n\n​\n\nWe believe we are well-positioned to generate strong cash flows by identifying and taking advantage of attractive chartering opportunities in the International Flag tanker market. We will continue to pursue an overall chartering strategy, with a substantial spot rate exposure that provides us with higher returns when the more volatile spot market is stronger.\n\n2\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n​\n\nWe currently deploy the majority of our fleet on a spot rate basis to benefit from market volatility and what we believe are the traditionally higher returns the spot market offers compared with time charters. We believe this strategy continues to offer significant upside exposure to the spot market and an opportunity to capture enhanced profit margins at times when vessel demand exceeds supply. As of December 31, 2024, we participated in six commercial pools as our principal means of participation in the spot market— Tankers International (“TI”), Maersk Tankers Suezmax Pool (“MAERSK”), Panamax International (“PI”), Clean Products Tankers Alliance (“CPTA”), Norden Tanker Pool (“NTP”) and Aframax International Pool (“AI”) — each selected for specific expertise in its respective market. Our continued participation in pools allows us to benefit from economies of scale and higher vessel utilization rates.\n\n​\n\nWe plan to continue to complement our spot chartering strategy by selectively employing a portion of our vessels on time charters that provide consistent cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, we had three VLCCs, one Suezmax, one Aframax, one LR2 and eight MRs on time charters expiring between February 2025 and April 2030. We may seek to place other tonnage on time charters, for storage or transport, when we can do so at attractive rates.\n\n​\n\nActively manage our fleet to maximize return on capital over market cycles.\n\n​\n\nWe will continue to actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic accretive acquisitions and dispositions as part of our effort to achieve above-market returns on capital for our vessel assets and renew our fleet. Using our commercial, financial and operational expertise, we will continue to execute our plan to opportunistically grow our fleet through the timely and selective acquisition of high-quality secondhand vessels, resales or newbuild contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow. We also intend to continue to engage in opportunistic dispositions where we can achieve attractive values for our vessels relative to their anticipated future earnings from operations as we assess the market cycle. Taken together, we believe these activities have and will continue to help us maintain a balanced, high-quality and modern fleet of crude oil and refined product vessels with an enhanced return on invested capital. We believe our balanced and versatile fleet, our experience and our long-standing relationships with participants in the crude and refined product shipping industry position us to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities in any vessel class in the international market.\n\n​\n\nMaintain an appropriate and flexible financial profile.\n\n​\n\nWe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and prudent financial leverage with sufficient liquidity that positions us to take advantage of attractive strategic opportunities throughout the dynamic tanker cycles of the shipping sector. During 2024, we maintained what we believe to be reasonable financial leverage for the current point in the tanker cycle. As of December 31, 2024, we had total liquidity on a consolidated basis of $632.2 million, comprised of $157.5 million of cash and short-term investments and $474.7 million of remaining undrawn revolver capacity, as well as a Consolidated Net Debt to Assets Value and Consolidated Net Debt to Book Capital ratios of 15.5% and 22.2%, respectively. \n\n​\n\nSustainability and governance initiatives\n\n​\n\nWe are committed to fulfilling our mission of transporting energy safely and efficiently to customers around the world using well-maintained assets operated by dedicated crews in a diligent and environmentally sustainable manner. We are acutely aware of our role as a crude and petroleum products transporter in a world gradually transitioning to cleaner energy sources. While we believe that oil will continue to play a significant role in the global energy landscape during this transition, we are committed to supporting and adapting to the shift toward cleaner energy. We welcome and support efforts, such as those led by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), to increase transparency and to promote investors’ understanding of how we and our industry peers are addressing the climate change-related risks and opportunities particular to our industry. The Company’s governance, strategy, risk management and performance monitoring efforts in this area are evolving and will continue to do so over time. We have disclosed certain information relating to sustainability and governance on our website, including our Sustainability Disclosure Report, aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Marine Transportation standard, and recommendations provided by the TCFD. The report includes information on how we monitor, manage and perform on material sustainability and governance issues in the face of increasing expectations and regulations. Our Sustainability Disclosure Report may be found on our website at www.intlseas.com and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\n\n​\n\nGovernance – Our Board of Directors (the “Board”), which had nine members as of December 31, 2024, including seven independent members, has experts in shipping and compliance and engages in regular discussions relating to environmental matters and the \n\n3\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nCompany’s response to climate change-related risks and opportunities. During 2024, the Board established a committee of the Board to assist the Board in fulfilling its sustainability oversight responsibilities with respect to Environmental and Social policies, strategies and programs. The Company’s management team, led by the Chief Executive Officer, has the day-to-day responsibility to execute the action plans as approved by the Board.\n\n​\n\nStrategy – We are committed to sustainability and governance practices as a part of our core culture. To achieve our goals, we have taken actions which include:\n\n​\n\n-The establishment of a Performance and Sustainability team that is tasked with both educating the organization as well as putting in place programs and initiatives to expand our decarbonization efforts;\n\n-The continuing implementation of a third-party data collection and analysis platform which allows data to be gathered from our vessels for use in advanced analytics with the aim of reducing our fuel consumption and CO2 and GHG emissions;\n\n-The inclusion of a sustainability-linked pricing mechanism in both the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility and the $160 Million Revolving Credit Facility. The mechanism has been certified by an independent, leading firm in sustainability and corporate governance research as meeting sustainability-linked loan principles. The adjustment in pricing will be linked to the carbon efficiency of the INSW fleet as it relates to reductions in CO2 emissions year-over-year, such that it aligns with the IMO’s industry reduction targets in GHG emissions by 2050 (as per the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships). This key performance indicator is calculated in a manner consistent with the de-carbonization trajectory outlined in the Poseidon Principles, the global framework by which financial institutions can assess the climate alignment of their ship finance portfolios. The relevant emissions data for our fleet will be reported to the applicable Classification Societies, the IMO and the lenders under our sustainability-linked loan facility. We also intend to make such emissions data publicly available. In addition to this GHG reduction measure, the pricing mechanism in the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility also includes key performance indicators relating to crew safety and investment by the Company aimed at improving energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions;\n\n-Participation in ITOPF (formerly known as the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation), the leading not-for-profit marine ship pollution response advisors;\n\n-Participation in the Marine Anti-Corruption Network, a global business network of over 220 members whose vision is a maritime industry free of corruption that enables fair trade to the benefit of society at large;\n\n-Membership in the Society for Gas as a Marine Fuel, an organization providing expertise on the use of low and zero carbon marine fuels;\n\n-Membership on the steering committee of Together in Safety, an industry consortium connecting the maritime sector to improve safety performance;\n\n-Participation on the steering committee of the All Aboard Alliance, which aims to make the maritime industry more diverse and inclusive and to ensure equitable opportunities for everyone;\n\n-Participation in the North American Marine Environmental Protection Association; \n\n-Participation as a signatory to the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change, in a worldwide call to action to improve working conditions for seafarers by increasing transparency around mental health, connectivity, shore leave, and work/rest hours;\n\n-Participation as a signatory to the Gulf of Guinea Declaration on the Suppression of Piracy, which has been signed by more than 500 organizations across the maritime industry and sets out a series of steps to help decrease and end the threat of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea;\n\n-The installation of Ballast Water Treatment Systems on vessels to comply with all applicable regulations;\n\n-Specific consideration of overall fuel consumption when selecting vessel purchase candidates and ships in our fleet to consider for disposition, in order to reduce our fleet’s contribution to GHG emissions; and\n\n4\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n-Our continued commitment to practice environmentally and socially responsible ship recycling. Stoppage of work until identified unsafe working conditions are rectified and improvements in procedures for materials handling were some of the positive takeaways noted from our most recent recycling projects.\n\nAdditionally, we are developing a plan to meet the IMO’s 2050 and interim GHG emissions targets. The pathway to achieve these targets includes short-term, mid-term and long-term components, such as:\n\n-We have embarked on a significant Fleet Decarbonization Project to enhance and align our sustainability strategy with stakeholder expectations. We are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the future readiness and decarbonization capabilities of our vessels. This project will set the foundation for a robust formalized transition plan, ensuring that our fleet is well-prepared to meet the demands of a low-carbon future. \n\n-We completed the construction of our three dual-fuel LNG VLCCs at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering’s shipyard during 2023. We expect these tankers to be well suited to adhere to future environmental regulation throughout their life.  \n\n-We are currently constructing six dual-fuel ready LR1s, as discussed in the “2024 in Review” section above.\n\n-We have installed, and placed a number of additional orders for, energy savings devices such as wake improvement ducts, propellor boss cap fins (PBCFs), and advanced hull coatings which significantly reduce our carbon footprint and adhere to future environmental regulations.\n\n-We are actively studying other technologies, such as e-fuels and carbon capture, which are not yet mature, or available at scale, but could prove to be an important part of achieving the industry’s decarbonization ambitions.\n\nRisk Management – Due to the nature of our business, environmental and climate change-related risks are included in key risks discussed at the Board of Directors level. What we believe to be the most significant of such risks are described in the “Item 1A – Risk Factors” section below.\n\n​\n\nMetrics and Targets – As a part of the actions described in the “Strategy” section above, we are working to meet the carbon efficiency targets included in our sustainability-linked loans and to continue to establish other appropriate metrics by which to measure our performance and drive improvement.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFLEET OPERATIONS\n\n​\n\nFleet Summary\n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our operating fleet consisted of 78 vessels, 63 of which were owned and 15 of which were chartered in (including 13 vessels under bareboat charters pursuant to sale and leaseback arrangements which are deemed to be financing arrangements). Vessels chartered-in include two time charters. The Company is subject to purchase obligations for 10 of the vessels under sale and leaseback financing arrangements at the end of each bareboat charter. See Note 15, “Leases,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information \n\n5\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nrelating to the Company’s chartered-in vessels. The Company’s fleet list excludes vessels chartered-in where the duration of the charter was one year or less at inception, as well as any workboats chartered-in by our Crude Tankers Lightering business.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTotal at December 31, 2024\n\nVessel Fleet and Type\n\n​\n\nVessels Owned\n\n​\n\nVessels Chartered-in\n\n​\n\nNumber\n\n​\n\nTotal Dwt\n\nOperating Fleet\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCrude Tankers\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nVLCC \n\n​\n\n 4\n\n​\n\n 9\n\n​\n\n 13\n\n​\n\n 3,910,572\n\nSuezmax\n\n​\n\n13 \n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 13\n\n​\n\n 2,061,754\n\nAframax\n\n​\n\n4 \n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 4\n\n​\n\n 452,375\n\nTotal \n\n​\n\n 21\n\n​\n\n 9\n\n​\n\n 30\n\n​\n\n 6,424,701\n\nProduct Carriers\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLR2\n\n​\n\n 1\n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 1\n\n​\n\n 112,691\n\nLR1\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n 2\n\n​\n\n 8\n\n​\n\n 596,092\n\nMR\n\n​\n\n35 \n\n​\n\n 4\n\n​\n\n 39\n\n​\n\n 1,951,516\n\nTotal \n\n​\n\n 42\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n 48\n\n​\n\n 2,660,299\n\nTotal Owned and Operated Fleet\n\n​\n\n 63\n\n​\n\n 15\n\n​\n\n 78\n\n​\n\n 9,085,000\n\nNewbuild Fleet\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLR1\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n441,600\n\nTotal Newbuild Fleet\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 6\n\n​\n\n 441,600\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTotal Operating and Newbuild Fleet\n\n​\n\n 69\n\n​\n\n 15\n\n​\n\n 84\n\n​\n\n 9,526,600\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBusiness Segments\n\n​\n\nThe bulk shipping of crude oil and refined petroleum products has many distinct market segments based largely on the size and design configuration of vessels required and, in some cases, on the flag of registry. Freight rates in each market segment are determined by a variety of factors affecting the supply and demand for suitable vessels. Our diverse fleet gives us the ability to provide a broad range of services to global customers. Tankers and product carriers are not bound to specific ports or schedules and therefore can respond to market opportunities by moving between trades and geographical areas. The Company has established two reportable business segments: Crude Tankers and Product Carriers.\n\n​\n\nFor additional information regarding the Company’s two reportable segments for the three years ended December 31, 2024, see Note 4, “Business and Segment Reporting,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\n​\n\nCrude Tankers (including Crude Tankers Lightering)\n\n​\n\nOur Crude Tankers reportable business segment is made up of a fleet of VLCCs, Suezmaxes, and Aframaxes engaged in the worldwide transportation of crude oil.\n\n​\n\nThis segment also includes our Crude Tankers Lightering business through which we provide ship-to-ship (or “STS”) lightering support services and full-service STS lightering to customers in the U.S. Gulf (“USG”), U.S. Pacific, Grand Bahama and Panama regions. In STS lightering support service, we provide the personnel and equipment (hoses and fenders) to facilitate the transferring of cargo between seagoing ships positioned alongside each other, either stationary or underway. In full-service STS lightering, we provide the lightering vessel, usually an Aframax tanker, in addition to the personnel and equipment to facilitate the transferring of cargo. Demand for lightering services is significantly affected by the level of crude oil imports into the United States and, in recent years, by the volumes of crude oil exports from the United States. Our customers include oil companies and trading companies that are importing or exporting crude oil in the USG to or from larger Suezmax and VLCC vessels, which are prevented from using certain ports due to their size and draft.\n\n​\n\n6\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nProduct Carriers\n\n​\n\nOur Product Carriers reportable business segment consists of a fleet of MRs, LR1 product carriers, and an LR2 product carrier engaged in the worldwide transportation of refined petroleum products. Refined petroleum product cargoes are transported from refineries to consuming markets characterized by both long and short-haul routes. The market for these product cargoes is driven by global refinery capacity, changes in consumer demand and product specifications and cargo arbitrage opportunities. In contrast to the crude oil tanker market, the refined petroleum trades are more complex due to the diverse nature of product cargoes, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, home heating oil, vegetable oils and organic chemicals (e.g., methanol and ethylene glycols). The trades require crew to have specialized certifications. Customer vetting requirements can be more rigorous and, in general, vessel operations are more complex due to the fact that refineries can be in closer proximity to importing nations, resulting in more frequent port calls and more discharging, cleaning and loading operations than crude oil tankers. The Company’s MR product carriers are IMO III compliant, allowing those vessels to carry edible oils, such as palm and vegetable oil, increasing flexibility when switching between cargo grades. \n\n​\n\nIn order to take advantage of market conditions and optimize economic performance, we employ our LR1 Product Carriers, which currently participate in the PI pool, in the transportation of crude oil cargoes.\n\n​\n\nCommercial and Technical Management of Fleet – Hybrid Operating Model\n\n​\n\nWe employ a hybrid operating model in the commercial and technical management of our fleet.  Our in-house commercial and technical management experts utilize third-party service providers to execute our commercial and technical operations, while providing us with the flexibility to scale operations up or down with our fleet across various shipping cycles. \n\nCommercial Pools and other Commercial Management Arrangements\n\n​\n\nWe currently utilize third-party managed pools as the principal commercial strategy for our vessels participating in the spot voyage charter markets. By operating a large number of vessels as an integrated transportation system, commercial pools offer customers greater flexibility and a higher level of service while achieving scheduling efficiencies. Pools are commercially managed by experienced commercial operators that, among other things, arrange charters for the vessels participating in the pool in exchange for an administrative fee. Technical management is performed or outsourced by each shipowner. The pools collect revenue from customers, pay voyage-related expenses, and distribute TCE revenues to the participants after deducting administrative fees, according to formulas that capture the contribution of each vessel to the pool by:\n\n●first, summarizing the earnings capacity of each vessel (as determined by the pool operator based largely on the physical characteristics and fuel consumption) to a number of “points;”\n\n●second, multiplying each vessel’s “points” by the number of days that vessel operated during a specified period (the “Vessel Contribution”);\n\n●third, multiplying the total number of points of all vessels in the pool by the total number of days all vessels in the pool operated (the “Total Earnings”); and\n\n●fourth, dividing the Vessel Contribution by the Total Earnings.\n\nPools negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. The size and scope of these pools enable them to enhance utilization for pool vessels by securing backhaul voyages and Contracts of Affreightment (“COAs”), thereby reducing wait time and providing a high level of service to customers.\n\n​\n\nWe also employ third-party commercial managers on a limited basis for some of our vessels from time-to-time in the spot market through Commercial Management Agreements (“CMAs”). Under the CMAs, the manager collects revenue, pays for voyage related expenses and distributes the actual voyage results for each individual ship under management and receives a management fee.\n\n​\n\n7\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nThe table below summarizes the pool deployment of our conventional tanker fleet as of December 31, 2024:\n\n​\n\n(a)We took delivery of a 2015-built MR on December 30, 2024 and the vessel went on to its scheduled drydock. The vessel will join Clean Products Tankers Alliance Pool after the completion of drydock in 2025. \n\n​\n\n​\n\nSpot Market\n\n​\n\nVoyage charters, including vessels operating in commercial pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 86% of the Company’s aggregate TCE revenues in 2024 compared to 91% in 2023. Accordingly, the Company’s shipping revenues are significantly affected by the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products.\n\n​\n\nSeasonal trends affect world oil consumption and consequently vessel demand. While trends in consumption vary with seasons, peaks in demand quite often precede the seasonal consumption peaks as refiners and suppliers try to anticipate consumer demand. Seasonal peaks in oil demand have been principally driven by increased demand prior to Northern Hemisphere winters and increased demand for gasoline prior to the summer driving season in the United States. Available tonnage is affected over time by the volume of newbuilding deliveries, the number of tankers used to store clean products and crude oil, and the removal (principally through vessel recycling or conversion) of existing vessels from service. Vessel recycling is affected by the level of freight rates, recycling prices, vetting standards established by charterers and terminals and by international and U.S. governmental regulations that establish maintenance standards and regulatory compliance standards.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n8\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nTime Charter Market\n\n​\n\nTime charters constituted 14% and 9% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had three VLCCs, one Suezmax, one Aframax, one LR2 and eight MRs deployed on non-cancelable time charters expiring between February 2025 and April 2030.  Within a contract period, time charters provide a predictable level of revenues without the fluctuations inherent in spot-market rates. Once a time charter expires, however, the ability to secure a new time charter may be uncertain and subject to market conditions at such time. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — General,” for further information on the future minimum revenues, before reduction for brokerage commissions, expected to be received on our non-cancelable time charters.\n\n​\n\nTechnical Management\n\n​\n\nIn an effort to streamline our operations, during 2022, we began the process of paring down the number of outsourced third-party technical managers to only two managers from five managers. This transition process was successfully completed during the second quarter of 2023. The managers supervise the technical management of our vessels and the integrity of our operations to ensure industry leading safety, compliance, environmental protection and service quality. We retain a pool of well-trained seafarers to serve on our vessels. We continue to hire the crew, with the managers acting as agents on our behalf.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to regular maintenance and repair, crews onboard each vessel and shoreside personnel must ensure that the vessels in the Company’s fleet meet or exceed regulatory standards established by organizations such as the IMO and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES \n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 2,824 employees comprised of 2,757 seafarers employed on our fleet and 67 shoreside staff. \n\nWe believe a commitment to and investment in human capital management helps us build competitive advantage and furthers our long-term success. Our highly skilled seafarers and shoreside employees are the foundation of everything that we do and the embodiment of our “do the right thing” culture. We depend on our workforce to provide superior service and to ensure our vessels are operated safely and securely. Our seafarers are hired by the technical managers acting as agent for the individual ship owning companies, each of which is a subsidiary of INSW. All of the seafarers onboard our vessels are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our seafarers and union relationships to be strong. \n\nTo facilitate the recruitment, development and retention of our valuable seafarers and shoreside employees, we strive to make INSW an inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers.\n\nTalent Development\n\nTo support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top seafarer and shoreside talent. On average, our seafarers have worked for us for more than 10 years and more than half of our shore-based employees have worked for us for at least 16 years. For our seafarers, ongoing training is integral to conducting safe operations and keeping employees engaged. One key part of our training regimen is our crew conferences. Senior leaders from the Company, our fleet and our third-party managers spend three days with up to 100 seafarers from across our fleet, representing all ranks and nationalities. During the conferences, the seafarers are updated on new policies, regulations, and procedures.  Interactive learning sessions and team building exercises are used to foster communication and shared learnings. Day long training sessions are capped off with a social agenda that celebrates successes during the year and includes the presentation of awards for long time service with the Company. This presents management with both an opportunity to teach and to learn and provides everyone with an excellent networking opportunity. \n\n​\n\nSuccession Planning\n\n​\n\nOur Board of Directors believe that planning for succession is an important function. We continually strive to foster the professional development of management and team members. We continue to invest in developing a very experienced and strong group of leaders, \n\n9\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nwith their performance subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, as potential successors to our senior management, including our CEO.\n\n​\n\nBroad-based workforce\n\n​\n\nWe are committed to attracting a talented, experienced and broad-based workforce. We believe unique ideas and perspectives fuel innovation and our differences make us stronger and better. We value difference in gender, race, ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, cultural background, religion, veteran status, experience, thought, and more across the globe. We recognize the importance of teams from different backgrounds and a broad-based culture in driving innovation and competitiveness. \n\n​\n\nOur Board of Directors and executive management team each represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that our nine member Board of Directors (three of whom are women and one of whom is an underrepresented minority) and our seven member executive leadership team (two of whom are women and one of whom is an underrepresented minority) are varied by ethnic heritage, non-U.S. place of birth, or gender and reflect our ongoing commitment to hiring, developing, and retaining talent from different backgrounds. \n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2024\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFemale\n\n​\n\nMale\n\nShoreside Employees\n\n​\n\n 26\n\n​\n\n 41\n\nSeafarers\n\n​\n\n 3\n\n​\n\n 2,754\n\nTotal Employees\n\n​\n\n 29\n\n​\n\n 2,795\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAs of December 31, 2024\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFemale\n\n​\n\nMale\n\nBoard of Directors(a)\n\n​\n\n 3\n\n​\n\n 6\n\nNon-Director Senior Management\n\n​\n\n —\n\n​\n\n 5\n\nNon-Director Senior Management Direct Reports\n\n​\n\n 25\n\n​\n\n 36\n\n(a)Includes our CEO who is also a member of the Board of Directors\n\n​\n\nWe recognize the need to address gender representation in our industry. While we take pride in the wide range of nationalities represented among our seafarers, we acknowledge that our crews are almost entirely male. Unfortunately, this gender disparity is not unique to our company but prevalent across the broader shipping industry, as only 2% of the crewing population is female, the majority of whom sail in the cruise and leisure segments. We are committed to overcoming hurdles to women’s career opportunities at sea, ensuring safety, and fostering an environment in which all people can thrive. \n\n​\n\nInternational Seaways is a founding member of the Global Maritime Forum’s All Aboard Alliance, a transformative industry initiative aimed at fostering a broad-based workforce both ashore and at sea. As part of this significant commitment, we actively participate in the Diversity@Sea project, a focused endeavor dedicated to enhancing career opportunities for women in the maritime industry.  \n\n​\n\nSafety, Quality and Health\n\n​\n\nWe are committed to creating a safe, healthy and secure workplace at sea and onshore. We are also committed to providing safe, reliable and environmentally sound transportation to our customers. Integral to meeting standards mandated by worldwide regulators and customers is a ship manager’s use of robust Safety Management Systems (“SMS”). The SMS is a framework of processes and procedures that addresses a spectrum of operational risks associated with quality, environment, health and safety. The SMS is certified by the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), promulgated by the IMO and the International Standards Organization (“ISO”), and meets ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) requirements. To support a culture of transparency, accountability and compliance, we have an open reporting system on all of our ships, whereby seafarers can anonymously report possible violations of our or our third-party technical and commercial manager’s policies and procedures. All open reports are investigated, and appropriate actions are taken when necessary.\n\n​\n\nOur commitment to safety also extends to our continued response to changes in how we work and collaborate shoreside. In 2024, we have maintained the hybrid work schedule introduced in 2022, taking into account collaboration, convenience and work-life balance for our shoreside employees. \n\n10\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n​\n\nCOMPETITION\n\n​\n\nThe shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with other owners of International Flag tankers, including other independent shipowners, integrated oil companies, state-owned entities with their own fleets, and oil traders with logistical operations. Our vessels compete with all other vessels of a size and type required by the customer that can be available at the date and location specified. In the spot market, competition is based primarily on price, cargo quantity and cargo type, although charterers are selective with respect to the quality of the vessels they hire considering other key factors such as the reliability, age and quality and efficiency of operations and experience of crews. In the time charter market, factors such as the age and quality of the vessel and the efficiency of its operation and reputation of its owner and operator tend to be even more significant when competing for business.\n\n​\n\nOur lightering business competes against a small number of other market participants, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. \n\n​\n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SECURITY MATTERS RELATING TO BULK SHIPPING\n\n​\n\nGovernment regulation significantly affects the operation of the Company’s vessels. INSW’s vessels operate in a heavily regulated environment and are subject to international conventions and international, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which such vessels operate or are registered.\n\n​\n\nThe Company’s vessels undergo regular and rigorous safety inspections and audits which are conducted by the ships’ third-party managers. In addition, a variety of governmental and private entities subject the Company’s vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include USCG, local port state control authorities (harbor master or equivalent), coastal states, Classification Societies, flag state administration (country of registry) and customers, particularly major oil companies and petroleum terminal operators. Certain of these entities require INSW to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of the Company’s vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require INSW to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of the Company’s vessels.\n\n​\n\nThe Company believes that the heightened level of environmental, health, safety and quality awareness among various stakeholders, including lenders, insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers, is leading to greater safety and other regulatory requirements and a more stringent inspection regime on all vessels. The Company is required to maintain operating standards for all of its vessels emphasizing operational safety and quality, environmental stewardship, preventive planned maintenance, continuous training of its officers and crews and compliance with international and U.S. regulations. INSW believes that the operation of its vessels is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, because such laws and regulations are changed frequently, and new laws and regulations impose new or increasingly stringent requirements, INSW cannot predict the cost of complying with requirements beyond those that are currently in force. The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Company — Risks relating to legal and regulatory matters, compliance with complex laws, regulations and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect INSW’s business.”\n\n​\n\nInternational and U.S. Greenhouse Gas Regulations\n\n​\n\nIn February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (commonly called the Kyoto Protocol) became effective. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, adopting countries are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), which contribute to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted by about 190 countries, commits its parties by setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. In December 2012, the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted to further extend the Kyoto Protocol’s GHG emissions reductions through 2020. In December 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”) forged a new international framework (the “Paris Agreement”) that became effective in November 2016, after it had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible. To meet these objectives, the participating countries, acting individually or jointly, are to develop and implement successive “nationally determined contributions.” The countries assessed their collective programs toward achieving \n\n11\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nthe goals of the Paris Agreement in 2023 and agreed to reassess such programs every five years thereafter, referred to as the global stock take, and subsequently are to update and enhance their actions on climate change. The Paris Agreement does not specifically require controls on shipping or other industries, but it is possible that countries or groups of countries will seek to impose such controls as they implement the Paris Agreement. The United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, and, in April 2021, announced a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level target of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy wide net GHG pollution by 2030. However, in January 2025, President Trump directed the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement by an Executive Order. In November 2021, at UNFCCC’s COP26 in Glasgow, new initiatives to incorporate shipping in the climate change framework were proposed.  These proposals remain either voluntary among countries or represent efforts towards building consensus for further work within the maritime industry.  In particular, at COP26, a coalition of 19 countries including the United Kingdom and the United States signed the Clydebank Declaration to support and facilitate the establishment of at least six green shipping corridors – zero emission maritime routes between two or more ports -- by 2025, with a view toward increasing the number of green corridors over the longer term.  The Declaration noted that voluntary participation by operators would be essential. As of October 2024, 62 green corridor initiatives have been announced, six of which had moved to the preparation stage. \n\n​\n\nIn 2014, IMO’s third study of GHG emissions from the global shipping fleet predicted that, in the absence of appropriate policies, GHG emissions from ships may increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 due to expected growth in international seaborne trade. Methane emissions are projected to increase rapidly (albeit from a low base) as the share of LNG in the fuel mix increases. With respect to energy efficiency measures, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted guidelines on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”), which reflects the primary fuel for the calculation of the attained EEDI for ships having dual fuel engines using LNG and liquid fuel oil (see discussion below). IMO is committed to developing limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. In April 2018, IMO adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships, with the ultimate goal of eliminating GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible during this century. More specifically, under the identified “levels of ambition,” the initial strategy envisages the halt of the growth in GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and then the reduction of the total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.  In 2019, IMO launched a project for an initial two-year period to initiate and promote global efforts to demonstrate and test technical solutions for reducing GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency throughout the maritime sector. In 2020, IMO issued its Fourth GHG Study, which further refined IMO’s understanding of maritime greenhouse gas emissions and reported updated projections that in 2050 GHG emissions will increase from 0 to 50% over 2018 levels, which is equal to 90-130% of 2008 levels.   \n\n​\n\nAt the MEPC 76 in June 2021, the IMO, taking into account the findings of the Fourth GHG Study, adopted short-term measures that became effective in 2023 to implement its stated goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping by 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050, and GHG emissions from international shipping by 50% by 2050. The new measures will require ships to calculate their Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”) and to establish their annual operational carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) that links the GHG emissions to the amount of cargo carried over distance traveled.  Ships with low ratings are required to submit corrective action plans.  \n\n​\n\nMEPC 78 in June 2022 marked a significant step towards achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry by reiterating the commitment to revise the initial IMO GHG strategy with a strengthened ambition to reach net-zero emissions by around 2050, while also discussing and developing mid-term measures to achieve this goal; essentially, IMO signaled a strong push for the maritime industry to transition towards net-zero emissions by 2050. The main focus of MEPC 78 was to further develop plans for revising the initial IMO GHG strategy, aiming to include more ambitious targets for reducing emissions, including a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050.  The committee discussed and approved further development of a “basket of candidate mid-term GHG reduction measures,” which could include technical and carbon pricing elements to facilitate the transition towards net-zero. MEPC 78 acknowledged the need for more information regarding the readiness and availability of low- and zero-carbon marine fuels and technologies to support the revision process. The revised strategy was adopted in July 2023 at MEPC 80.  Supporting technical and economic measures are still under development.\n\n​\n\nIn 2011, the European Commission established a working group on shipping to provide input to the European Commission in its work to develop and assess options for the inclusion of international maritime transport in the GHG reduction commitment of the EU. The Measure, Report and Verify (“MRV”) Regulation was adopted on April 29, 2015 and created an EU-wide framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport. The MRV Regulation requires large ships (over 5,000 gross tons) calling at EU ports from January 1, 2018, to collect and later publish verified annual data on carbon dioxide emissions. \n\n12\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nIMO has developed similar MRV regulations that became effective on March 1, 2018 and the first reporting period was for the full year 2019. In July 2021, the EU issued draft legislation that from 2023 to 2026 would phase in GHG emissions from shipping into its established Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”) and require the purchase of allowances reflecting the emissions.  In December 2022, the EU Council and Parliament agreed to include maritime shipping emissions in the EU ETS, with a gradual introduction of obligations for shipping companies to surrender allowances: 40% for verified emissions from 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026. It was also agreed to include non-carbon dioxide emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) in the MRV scheme from 2024 and in the EU ETS from 2026. The Company cannot predict the specific impacts of the EU ETS on the shipping industry as a whole. To date, the EU ETS has not had a material impact on the Company because the Company has been able to pass on the cost of the emissions allowances contractually to charterers. \n\n​\n\nIn an effort to further reduce GHG emissions from the maritime sector, the EU has introduced the FuelEU Maritime regulation, which came into effect on January 1, 2025.  This regulation imposes annual penalties on vessels trading to and from European ports based on their GHG emissions, which are determined by the fuel consumed and the length of the voyage.\n\n​\n\nThe FuelEU Maritime regulation is designed to incentivize the use of low-emission fuels by providing reduced penalties for vessels operating on alternative fuels such as LNG, biofuels, ammonia and other low-carbon alternatives.  The penalties increase progressively over time, with vessels operating on LNG expected to remain largely unaffected until approximately 2035.  Additionally, the regulation allows vessel owners to offset emissions across their fleet, enabling them to pool credits and deficits between over-performing and under-performing vessels.\n\n​\n\nSimilar to the EU ETS, most vessel owners are incorporating contractual provisions in their charterparties to pass on FuelEU Maritime liabilities to charterers.  This measure aims to ensure that compliance costs associated with the regulation are allocated appropriately within the commercial framework of vessel operations.\n\n​\n\nThe Company cannot predict the precise financial or operational impact of FuelEU Maritime on the shipping industry or on the Company at this time. However, as the regulation evolves and penalties increase, it is expected to influence fuel choices, where and how vessels are fixed and contractual negotiations between vessel owners and charterers.\n\n​\n\nIn the United States, pursuant to U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2007 and 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has authority to regulate GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Although the EPA has promulgated certain regulations relating to GHG emissions, to date the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA have not involved ocean-going vessels. The EPA does participate in the U.S. delegation to the IMO and the Biden administration had committed to participating more actively in international efforts to control GHG emissions, including the IMO’s; however, it is not expected that such efforts will continue under the Trump administration. \n\n​\n\nFuture passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU, United States or other countries where INSW operates that restrict emissions of GHGs could require significant additional capital and/or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on INSW’s business. Although we cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to INSW’s results of operations.\n\n​\n\nInternational Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards\n\n​\n\nLiability Standards and Limits\n\n​\n\nMany countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the “1992 Protocol”). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territory, including the territorial waters (and in the exclusive economic zone under the 1992 Protocol) of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. Both instruments apply to all seagoing vessels carrying oil in bulk as cargo. These instruments also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances. As these instruments calculate liability in terms of a basket of currencies, the figures in this section are converted into U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates on January 24, 2025 and are approximate. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section “Liability Standards and Limits” and in “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards - Liability Standards and Limits” below.\n\n​\n\n13\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nUnder the 1969 Convention, except where the pollution damage resulted from the actual fault or privity of the owner, its liability is limited to $174 per ton of the vessel’s tonnage, with a maximum liability of $18.2 million. Under the 1992 Protocol, the liability of the owner is limited to $3.9 million for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage (a unit of measurement for the total enclosed spaces within a vessel) and $587 per gross ton thereafter, with a maximum liability of $77.8 million. Under the 1992 Protocol, the owner's liability is limited except where the pollution damage results from its personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. Under the 2000 amendments to the 1992 Protocol, which became effective on November 1, 2003, liability is limited to $5.9 million plus $822 for each additional gross ton over 5,000 for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, with a maximum liability of $116.9 million subject to the exceptions discussed above for the 1992 Protocol.\n\n​\n\nVessels trading to states that are parties to these instruments must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its P&I insurance will cover any liability under the plan adopted by the IMO. See the discussion of insurance in “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards-Liability Standards and Limits” below.\n\n​\n\nThe United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol. See “U.S. Environmental and Safety Restrictions and Regulations” below. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention.\n\n​\n\nThe International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001, which was adopted on March 23, 2001 and became effective on November 21, 2008, is a separate convention adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and exclusive economic zones, of states that are party to it. Vessels operating internationally are subject to it if sailing within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions (which does not include the United States). Key features of this convention are compulsory insurance or other financial security for vessels over 1,000 gross tons to cover the liability of the registered owner for pollution damage and direct action against the insurer. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.\n\n​\n\nOther International Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards\n\n​\n\nUnder the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, vessel operators are required to develop a safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy describing how the objectives of a functional safety management system will be met. The third-party managers of INSW’s vessels, have safety management systems for the Company’s fleet, with instructions and procedures for the safe operation of its vessels, reporting accidents and non-conformities, internal audits and management reviews and responding to emergencies, as well as defined levels of responsibility. The ISM Code requires a Document of Compliance (“DoC”) to be obtained for the company responsible for operating the vessel and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) to be obtained for each vessel that such company operates. Once issued, these certificates are valid for a maximum of five years. The company operating the vessel in turn must undergo an annual internal audit and an external verification audit in order to maintain the DoC. In accordance with the ISM Code, each vessel must also undergo an annual internal audit at intervals not to exceed twelve months and vessels must undergo an external verification audit twice in a five-year period. The Company’s third-party managers have DoCs for their offices.\n\n​\n\nThe SMC is issued after verifying that the company responsible for operating the vessel and its shipboard management operate in accordance with the approved safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its operator has been awarded a DoC issued by the administration of that vessel’s flag state or as otherwise permitted under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended (“SOLAS”).\n\n​\n\nIMO regulations also require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (“SOPEPs”). Periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required. In addition to SOPEPs, INSW has adopted Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans, which cover potential releases not only of oil but of any noxious liquid substances. Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG and EU authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading to United States and EU ports.\n\n​\n\n14\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nThe International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) is designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. The introduction of non-native species has been identified as one of the top five threats to biological diversity. Expanding seaborne trade and traffic have exacerbated the threat. Tankers must take on ballast water in order to maintain their stability and draft and must discharge the ballast water when they load their next cargo. When emptying the ballast water, which they carried from the previous port, they may release organisms and pathogens that have been identified as being potentially harmful in the new environment.\n\n​\n\nThe BWM Convention defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species, which standard is met by installing treatment systems that render the invasive species non-viable. In addition, each vessel is required to have on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book.\n\n​\n\nINSW’s vessels are subject to other international, national and local ballast water management regulations (including those described below under “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards”). INSW complies with these regulations through ballast water management plans implemented on each of the vessels in its fleet. To meet existing and anticipated ballast water treatment requirements, including those contained in the BWM Convention, INSW has a fleetwide action plan to comply with IMO, EPA, USCG and possibly more stringent U.S. state mandates as they are implemented and become effective, which may require the installation and use of costly control technologies. Compliance with the ballast water requirements effective under the BWM Convention and other regulations may have material impacts on INSW’s operations and financial results, as discussed below under “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards-Other U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards.”\n\n​\n\nOther EU Legislation and Regulations\n\n​\n\nThe EU has adopted legislation that: (1) bans manifestly sub-standard vessels (defined as those over 15 years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in the course of the preceding 24 months) from European waters, creates an obligation for port states to inspect at least 25% of vessels using their ports annually and provides for increased surveillance of vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine environment, and (2) provides the EU with greater authority and control over Classification Societies, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies. INSW believes that none of its vessels meet the definitions of a “sub-standard” vessel contained in the EU legislation. EU directives require EU member states to introduce criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances (e.g., from tank cleaning operations) which result in deterioration in the quality of water and has been committed with intent, recklessness or serious negligence. Certain member states of the EU, by virtue of their national legislation, already impose criminal sanctions for pollution events under certain circumstances. The Company cannot predict what additional legislation or regulations, if any, may be promulgated by the EU or any other country or authority, or how these might impact INSW.\n\n​\n\nInternational Air Emission Standards\n\n​\n\nAnnex VI to MARPOL (“Annex VI”) sets limits on sulfur oxide (“SOx”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also regulates shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds from tankers. Under Annex VI, the global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil is currently 0.50% and the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) is 0.1%. Currently designated ECAs are the Baltic Sea area, the North Sea area, the North American area (covering designated coastal areas off the United States and Canada) and the United States Caribbean Sea area (around Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands). For vessels over 400 gross tons, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. The U.S. Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2008 amended the U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to provide for the adoption of Annex VI. In October 2008, the U.S. ratified Annex VI, which came into force in the United States on January 8, 2009.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to Annex VI, there are regional mandates in ports and certain territorial waters within the EU, Turkey, China and Norway, for example, regarding reduced SOx emissions. These requirements establish maximum allowable limits for sulfur content in fuel oils used by vessels when operating within certain areas and waters and while “at berth.” In December 2012, an EU directive that aligned the EU requirements with Annex VI entered into force. For vessels at berth in EU ports, sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.1%. For vessels operating in SOx Emission Control Areas (“SECAs”), sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.1%. For vessels operating outside SECAs, sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.5%. Alternatively, emission abatement methods are permitted as long as they continuously achieve reductions of SOx emissions that are at least equivalent to those obtained using compliant marine fuels.\n\n15\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n​\n\nMore stringent Tier III emission limits are applicable to engines installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2016 operating in ECAs. NOx emission Tier III standards came into force on January 1, 2016 in ECAs, and require the use of high efficiency emission control technology such as selective catalytic reduction to achieve NOx reductions 80 percent below the pre-2016 levels. \n\n​\n\nAdditional air emission requirements under Annex VI mandate the development of Volatile Organic Compound (“VOC”) Management Plans for tank vessels and certain gas ships.\n\n​\n\nThe Company believes that its vessels are compliant with the current requirements of Annex VI and that those of its vessels that operate in the EU, Turkey, China, Norway and elsewhere are also compliant with the regional mandates applicable there. However, the Company anticipates that, in the next several years, compliance with the increasingly stringent requirements of Annex VI and other conventions, laws and regulations imposing air emission standards that have already been adopted or that may be adopted will require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on INSW’s business. Although INSW cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to INSW’s financial statements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSOLAS\n\n​\n\nFrom January 1, 2014, various amendments to the SOLAS conventions came into force, including an amendment to Chapter VI of SOLAS, which prohibits the blending of bulk liquid cargoes during sea passage and the production process on board ships. This prohibition does not preclude the master of the vessel from undertaking cargo transfers for the safety of the ship or protection of the marine environment.\n\n​\n\nMARPOL\n\n​\n\nEffective March 1, 2018, pursuant to an amendment to MARPOL Annex V, shippers are required to determine whether or not their cargo is hazardous and classify it in line with the criteria of the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification. Vessels are required to maintain a new format garbage record book, which is divided into two parts: cargo residues and garbage other than cargo residues. The cargo residues part must be further divided into hazardous and non-hazardous to the marine environment cargo. More stringent discharge requirements apply to hazardous cargo residues.\n\n​\n\nU.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards\n\n​\n\nThe United States regulates the shipping industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, consisting primarily of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). OPA 90 affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the waters of the United States, which include the U.S. territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone around the United States. CERCLA applies to the discharge of hazardous substances (other than oil) whether on land or at sea. Both OPA 90 and CERCLA impact the Company’s operations.\n\n​\n\nLiability Standards and Limits\n\n​\n\nUnder OPA 90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat or demise charterers are “responsible parties” who are liable, without regard to fault, for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages, including property and natural resource damages and economic loss without physical damage to property, arising from oil spills and pollution from their vessels. On December 9, 2022, USCG issued a final rule, effective March 23, 2023, increasing the limits of OPA 90 liability with respect to (i) tanker vessels with a qualifying double hull to the greater of $2,500 per gross ton or approximately $21.5 million per vessel that is over 3,000 gross tons; and (ii) non-tanker vessels, to the greater of $1,300 per gross ton or approximately $1.1 million per vessel. The statute specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. In some cases, states that have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws. CERCLA, which applies to owners and operators of vessels, contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages associated with discharges of hazardous substances (other than oil). Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million for vessels that carry hazardous substance as cargo or residue.\n\n​\n\n16\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nThese limits of liability do not apply, however, where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, these limits do not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities. OPA 90 and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.\n\nOPA 90 also requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under the statute. The USCG enacted regulations requiring evidence of financial responsibility consistent with the previous limits of liability described above for OPA 90 and CERCLA. Under the regulations, evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety bond, self-insurance, guaranty or an alternative method subject to approval by the Director of the USCG National Pollution Funds Center. Under OPA 90 regulations, an owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA 90 and CERCLA. INSW has provided the requisite guarantees and has received certificates of financial responsibility from the USCG for each of its vessels required to have one.\n\n​\n\nINSW has insurance for each of its vessels with pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1 billion. However, a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nIn addition to potential liability under OPA 90, vessel owners may in some instances incur liability on an even more stringent basis under state law in the particular state where the spillage occurred. The State of California’s Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act requires vessels of a specified size and oil carrying capacity that operate in California waters to have a California State certificate of financial responsibility (“COFR”) equal to at least $2 billion and imposes certain criminal fines in the event of an oil spill.\n\n​\n\nOther U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards\n\n​\n\nOPA 90 also amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require owners and operators of vessels to adopt vessel response plans, including marine salvage and firefighting plans, for reporting and responding to vessel emergencies and oil spill scenarios up to a “worst case” scenario and to identify and ensure, through contracts or other approved means, the availability of necessary private response resources to respond to a “worst case discharge.” The plans must include contractual commitments with clean-up response contractors and salvage and marine firefighters in order to ensure an immediate response to an oil spill/vessel emergency. Each vessel has an USCG approved plan on file with the USCG and onboard the vessel. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated.\n\nOPA 90 requires training programs and periodic drills for shoreside staff and response personnel and for vessels and their crews. INSW’s third-party technical managers conduct such required training programs and periodic drills.\n\n​\n\nOPA 90 does not prevent individual U.S. states from imposing their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. In fact, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws are in some cases more stringent than U.S. federal law.\n\n​\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in U.S. navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under the more recent OPA 90 and CERCLA, discussed above.\n\n​\n\nAt the federal level in the United States, ballast water management is subject to two separate, partially interrelated regulatory regimes. One is administered by the USCG under the National Aquatic Nuisance and Control Act and National Invasive Species Act, and the other is administered by the EPA under the CWA.\n\n​\n\nUnder the USCG’s final rule on ballast water management for the control of nonindigenous species in U.S. waters, which generally is in line with the requirements set out in the BWM Convention, the treatment systems for domestic and foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters must be Type Approved by the USCG. INSW’s vessels discharging ballast in U.S. waters currently have, or INSW expects such vessels will have, Type Approved treatment systems by their extended compliance dates.\n\nThe discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in U.S. ports also is subject to CWA permitting requirements. In accordance with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the Company is subject to a Vessel General Permit (“VGP”), which addresses, among other matters, the discharge of ballast water and effluents. \n\n17\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nThe current VGP identifies twenty-six vessel discharge streams and establishes numeric ballast water discharge limits that generally align with the treatment technologies to be implemented under USCG’s final rule, requirements to ensure that the ballast water treatment systems are functioning correctly, and more stringent effluent limits for oil to sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber wastewater. The VGP contains a compliance date schedule for these requirements. In December 2018 Congress enacted the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, which included the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”). VIDA reduces the scope of the VGP and is expected to align state and local discharge standards with federal standards. Under VIDA, the EPA was designated the government agency responsible for establishing national standards of performance for U.S. ballast water regulations, and the USCG was assigned the responsibility for implementing, monitoring and enforcing those standards pursuant to regulations to be developed. In September 2024, the EPA finalized the performance standards, giving the USCG two years to develop implementation, compliance, and enforcement regulations. Once the USCG publishes corresponding implementing regulations under VIDA (anticipated in 2026), the discharge of ballast water in the navigable waters of the United States will no longer be subject to the VGP. In the meantime, the current VGP and regulations remain in effect. \n\nCertain of the Company’s vessels are subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits under the EPA’s VGP, even though those vessels have obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under the final rule. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP, but in December 2013 it issued an Enforcement Response Policy (“ERP”) to address this industry-wide issue. Under the ERP, the EPA states that vessels that have received an extension from the USCG, are in compliance with all of the VGP’s requirements other than the numeric discharge limits and meet certain other requirements will be entitled to a “low enforcement priority.” While INSW believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the VGP’s numeric discharge limits during the pendency of a USCG extension will be entitled to such low priority treatment under the ERP no assurance can be given that they will do so.\n\nThe VGP system also permits individual states and territories to impose more stringent requirements for discharges into the navigable waters of such state or territory. Certain individual states have enacted legislation or regulations addressing hull cleaning and ballast water management. For example, California has adopted extensive requirements for more stringent effluent limits and discharge monitoring and testing requirements with respect to discharges in its waters. \n\nFollowing an assessment by the California State Lands Commission of the current technology for meeting ballast water management standards, California extended the deadline for compliance with stringent interim standards to 2030 and the deadline for final “zero detect” standards to 2040. In the interim, the California State Lands Commission incorporated the federal ballast water discharge standards and implementation schedule into California law and established operational monitoring and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nNew York State has imposed a more stringent bilge water discharge requirement for vessels in its waters than what is required by the VGP or IMO. Through its Section 401 Certification of the VGP, New York prohibits the discharge of all bilge water in its waters. New York State also requires that vessels entering its waters from outside the Exclusive Economic Zone must perform ballast water exchange in addition to treating it with a ballast water treatment system.\n\nU.S. Air Emissions Standards\n\n​\n\nPursuant to MARPOL Annex VI, EPA adopted regulations implementing the provisions of Annex VI, which regulations require subject vessels to comply with the applicable Annex VI provisions when they enter U.S. ports or operate in most internal U.S. waters. The Company’s vessels are currently Annex VI compliant. Accordingly, absent any new and onerous Annex VI implementing regulations, the Company does not expect to incur material additional costs in order to comply with this convention.\n\n​\n\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990 (“CAA”), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. INSW’s vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. Each of the Company’s vessels operating in the transport of clean petroleum products in regulated port areas where vapor control standards are required has been outfitted with a vapor recovery system that satisfies these requirements. In addition, the EPA issued emissions standards for marine diesel engines. The EPA has implemented rules comparable to those of Annex VI to increase the control of air pollutant emissions from certain large marine engines by requiring certain new marine-diesel engines installed on U.S. registered ships to meet lower NOx standards were implemented in two phases. The newly built engine standards that became effective in 2011 required more efficient use of current engine technologies, including engine timing, engine cooling, and advanced computer controls to achieve a 15 to 25 percent NOx reduction below previous levels. More stringent long-term standards for newly built engines that applied beginning in 2016 and required the use of high efficiency emission control technology such as selective catalytic reduction to achieve NOx reductions 80 percent below the pre-2016 levels. \n\n18\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nFuel used by all vessels operating in the North American ECA, encompassing the area extending 200 miles from the coastlines of the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands, and the United States Caribbean Sea ECA, encompassing water around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, cannot exceed 0.1% sulfur. The Company believes that its vessels are in compliance with the current requirements of the ECAs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the EPA or the states where INSW operates, compliance could require or affect the timing of significant capital and/or operating expenditures that could be material to INSW’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\nThe CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in major metropolitan and industrial areas. Where states fail to present approvable SIPs, or SIP revisions by certain statutory deadlines, the EPA is required to draft a Federal Implementation Plan. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from barge loading and degassing operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Where required, the Company’s vessels are already equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and otherwise increase its costs, the Company believes, based upon the regulations that have been proposed to date, that no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required as a result of the SIPs program.\n\n​\n\nIndividual states have been considering their own restrictions on air emissions from engines on vessels operating within state waters. California requires certain ocean-going vessels operating within 24 nautical miles of the Californian coast to reduce air pollution by using only low-sulfur marine distillate fuel rather than bunker fuel in auxiliary diesel and diesel-electric engines, main propulsion diesel engines and auxiliary boilers. Vessels sailing within 24 miles of the California coastline whose itineraries call for them to enter any California ports, terminal facilities, or internal or estuarine waters must use marine gas oil or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content at or below 0.1% sulfur and does not allow compliance via scrubbers. The Company believes that its vessels that operate in California waters are in compliance with these regulations.\n\n​\n\nVessels calling at California ports (Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, San Diego, San Francisco and Hueneme) must turn off auxiliary engines in port and connect the vessel to shoreside power, a process known as cold ironing. In August 2020, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) announced expansion of its existing at-berth air emissions requirements.  These changes require all ocean-going vessel operators and terminal operators to report each visit made to any California marine terminal and will require that ships at berths in California ports operate with either shoreside power or with CARB-approved emission controls on auxiliary engines and boilers for the duration of the visit, unless the visit qualifies for an exception or an alternative compliance option is used.  Reporting requirements for all vessel types began in 2023. As of January 1, 2025, tanker vessels visiting terminals in the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are subject to the updated at-berth air emissions requirements. These updated requirements become effective for all tanker vessels at other California ports in 2027. \n\n​\n\nSecurity Regulations and Practices\n\n​\n\nSecurity at sea has been a concern to governments, shipping lines, port authorities and importers and exporters for years. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. In 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) came into effect and the USCG issued regulations in 2003 implementing certain portions of the MTSA by requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, effective in July 2004, a new subchapter of SOLAS imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is applicable to all cargo vessels of 500 gross tons plus all passenger ships operating on international voyages, mobile offshore drilling units, as well as port facilities that service them. The objective of the ISPS Code is to establish the framework that allows detection of security threats and implementation of preventive measures against security incidents that can affect ships or port facilities used in international trade. Among other things, the ISPS Code requires the development of vessel security plans and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state.\n\n​\n\nThe USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt from MTSA vessel security measures for non-U.S. vessels that have on board a valid ISSC attesting to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code.\n\n​\n\n19\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nAll of INSW’s vessels have developed and implemented vessel security plans that have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, have obtained ISSCs and comply with applicable security requirements.\n\n​\n\nThe Company monitors the waters in which its vessels operate for pirate activity. Company vessels that transit areas where there is a high risk of pirate activity follow best management practices for reducing risk and preventing pirate attacks and are in compliance with protocols established by the naval coalition protective forces operating in such areas.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nINSPECTION BY CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES\n\n​\n\nEvery oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a Classification Society. The Classification Society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the Classification Society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the Classification Society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The Classification Society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.\n\nFor maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows:\n\n●Annual Surveys. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant and where applicable for special equipment classed, at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.\n\n●Intermediate Surveys. Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out between the occasions of the second or third annual survey.\n\n●Class Renewal Surveys. Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey the vessel is thoroughly examined, including ultrasonic measurements to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the Classification Society would prescribe steel renewals. The Classification Society may grant a one-year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the Classification Society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a shipowner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class survey period. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.\n\nVessels are required to dry dock for inspection of the underwater hull at each intermediate survey and at each class renewal survey. For tankers less than 15 years old, Classification Societies permit for intermediate surveys in water inspections by divers in lieu of dry docking, subject to other requirements of such Classification Societies.\n\n​\n\nIf defects are found during any survey, the Classification Society surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.\n\n​\n\nMost insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, or IACS. All our vessels are currently, and we expect will continue to be, certified as being “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of IACS. All new and secondhand vessels that we acquire must be certified as being “in class” prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel.\n\n​\n\n20\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n​\n\n​\n\nINSURANCE \n\n​\n\nConsistent with the currently prevailing practice in the industry, the Company presently carries protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance coverage for pollution of $1.0 billion per occurrence on every vessel in its fleet. P&I insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”). The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. Each P&I Association has capped its exposure to each of its members at approximately $8.9 billion. As a member of a P&I Association that is a member of the International Group, the Company is subject to calls payable to the P&I Associations based on its claim record as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual Associations of which it is a member, and the members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was a member of three P&I Associations. Each of the Company’s vessels is insured by one of these three Associations with deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.1 million per vessel per incident. While the Company has historically been able to obtain pollution coverage at commercially reasonable rates, no assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.\n\n​\n\nThe Company carries marine hull and machinery and war risk (including piracy) insurance, which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its vessels. The vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value, with deductibles ranging from $0.125 million to $0.250 million per vessel per incident. The Company is self-insured for hull and machinery claims in amounts in excess of the individual vessel deductibles up to a maximum aggregate loss of $1.5 million per policy year for certain of its vessels.\n\n​\n\nThe Company currently maintains loss of hire insurance to cover loss of charter income resulting from accidents or breakdowns of its vessels, and the bareboat chartered vessels that are covered under the vessels’ marine hull and machinery insurance. Loss of hire insurance covers up to 60 days lost charter income per vessel per incident in excess of the first 60 days lost for each covered incident, which is borne by the Company.\n\n​\n\nINCOME TAXATION OF THE COMPANY \n\n​\n\nINSW is incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and pursuant to the laws of the Marshall Islands, the Company is not subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands. All of the Company’s vessels are owned or operated by non-U.S. corporations that are subsidiaries of INSW.\n\n​\n\nU.S. Income Tax\n\n​\n\nThe following summary of the principal U.S. income tax laws applicable to the Company, as well as the conclusions regarding certain issues of income tax law, are based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur.\n\n​\n\nINSW derives substantially all of its gross income from the use and operation of vessels in international commerce. This income principally consists of hire from time and voyage charters for the transportation of cargoes and the performance of services directly related thereto, which is referred to herein as “shipping income.”\n\n​\n\nINSW’s vessels operate in various parts of the world, including to or from U.S. ports. Shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the U.S. will be considered to be 100% derived from sources within the United States. INSW does not engage in transportation that gives rise to 100% U.S. source income. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States and will generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax. \n\n​\n\nIn 2024 and prior years, INSW was exempt from taxation on its U.S. source shipping income under Section 883 of the Code and the corresponding Treasury regulations. For 2025 and future years, INSW will need to evaluate its qualification for exemption under Section 883 and there can be no assurance that INSW will continue to qualify for the exemption. \n\n21\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\nOur qualification for the exemption under Section 883 is described in more detail under “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters — We may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on U.S. source shipping income, which would reduce our net income and cash flows.” To the extent INSW is unable to qualify for exemption from tax under Section 883, INSW will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation of 4% of its U.S. source shipping income on a gross basis without the benefit of deductions.\n\n​\n\nTo the extent the Company (a) has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S. source shipping income, and (b) substantially all of the Company’s U.S. source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a recurring schedule of voyages that begin or end in the U.S., the Company’s U.S. source shipping income, together with other U.S. source income, is considered to be effectively connected income.  Currently, income effective connected with such a trade or business is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax imposed at a 21% rate and the Company may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax on such income.  The Company does not have any vessel with recurring voyages that begin or end in the U.S. on a regularly scheduled basis.  Therefore, the Company believes that none of its U.S. source shipping income constitute effectively connected income. \n\n​\n\nGlobal Minimum Tax\n\n​\n\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued Model Rules for implementation of a 15% minimum tax for multinational enterprises as part of its initiative intended to address the tax challenges arising from globalization. A number of countries have adopted the OECD’s minimum tax rules and have implemented these rules or local versions of these rules effective January 1, 2024. None of the Company’s subsidiaries are domiciled in such jurisdictions as of December 31, 2024. The application of the rules continues to evolve, and the adoption of these rules by countries in which subsidiaries of the Company are domiciled may alter our tax obligations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. We continue to evaluate the impact of these rules and are currently evaluating a variety of mitigating actions to reduce the potential impact.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​",

RISK FACTORS\n​\nThis section highlights important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1A. “Risk Factors” section.\n​\nSummary of Risk Factors \n​\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors you should be aware of before making a decision to invest in our common stock. This summary does not address all the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks we face, can be found below in this risk factor section and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n​\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n​\n\n●   The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company’s earnings and available cash.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect INSW’s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause INSW to incur impairment charges.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●

nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company’s earnings and available cash.\n​\nINSW depends on short duration, or “spot,” charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, which exposes INSW to fluctuations in market conditions. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, INSW derived approximately 86%, 91% and 96%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. The tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company’s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company’s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in INSW’s quarterly results and cash flows, and the Company’s ability to remain in compliance with financial covenants in its credit facilities. See “—The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities, term loans and certain vessel charters.” Furthermore, recent geopolitical instability and weather conditions have significantly benefitted the Company’s financial results by increasing tanker demand in 2022 and 2023. This increased demand remained at an elevated level in 2024. There can be no certainty as to when such geopolitical instability and weather conditions will normalize, and any such normalization could cause tanker rates to decline significantly.\n​\nFactors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:\n\n●   supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers’ need for vessel capacity;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regional availability of refining capacity and inventories;\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n●   changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers);\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   weather and natural disasters, including the continuing drought in Panama, reducing water levels in the Panama Canal and thereby decreasing the daily number of vessels permitted to transit the canal, resulting in delays in crossing the canal or extending their voyages by going around Cape Horn;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars, including the current Russia – Ukraine war and attacks by Iran – backed Houthi militants based in Yemen;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   developments in international trade generally;\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   government subsidies of shipbuilding;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   competition from alternative sources of energy.\n---------------------------------------------------\n​\nFactors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:\n\n●   the number of newbuilding deliveries;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   the recycling rate of older vessels;\n----------------------------------------\n\n●   environmental and maritime regulations;\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   the number of vessels being used for storage or as FSO service vessels;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the number of vessels that are removed from service;\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in the number of vessels ceasing to comply with sanctions imposed by the U.S., the UK and the EU, which changes either decrease or increase the number of vessels that participate in sanctions compliant trading;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   availability and pricing of other energy sources for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   port or canal congestion and weather delays.\n------------------------------------------------\n​\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being recycled, available capacity in that class will increase. The newbuilding order book of all classes of tankers (representing vessels in various stages of planning or construction that will be delivered in the future) equaled approximately 14%, 7% and 4% as of each of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n​\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect INSW’s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\n​\nThe market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:\n\n●   age of the vessel;\n----------------------\n\n●   general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   number of vessels in the world fleet;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   types and sizes of vessels available;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   cost of newbuildings;\n-------------------------\n\n●   prevailing level of charter rates;\n--------------------------------------\n\n●   environmental and maritime regulations;\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   competition from other shipping companies and from other modes of transportation;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   technological advances in vessel design and propulsion and overall vessel efficiency; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   ability to utilize less expensive fuels.\n--------------------------------------------\n​\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nDuring the second half of 2024, tanker values decreased, primarily because of lower TCE rates (resulting in part from reduced demand for oil transported on sanction compliant vessels, in particular reduced demand from China). If INSW sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel’s carrying amount on the Company’s financial statements, INSW will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declines in the values of the Company’s vessels could adversely affect the Company’s compliance with its loan covenants.\n​\nDeclines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause INSW to incur impairment charges.\n​\nThe Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amounts of the vessel assets might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including with respect to future freight rates, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel asset as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel’s carrying amount, the vessel’s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value. If the vessel’s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company’s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. The Company recorded a vessel impairment charge of $8.7 million during 2024.\n​\nChanges in the worldwide supply of vessels or an expansion of the capacity of newly-built tankers, without a commensurate shift in demand for such vessels, may cause spot charter rates to increase or decline, affecting INSW’s revenues, profitability and cash flows, and the value of its vessels.\n\nChanges in vessel supply have historically been a driver of both spot market rates and the overall cyclicality of the maritime industry. When the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being recycled over a period, available capacity in that class increases. Although vessel recycling levels over any particular period will depend on various factors, including charter rates and recycling prices, the newbuilding order book (i.e., vessels in various stages of planning or construction that will be delivered in the future) represented approximately 14% and 7% of the existing world tanker fleet as of each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition, if newly built tankers have more capacity than the tankers being recycled or otherwise removed from the active world fleet, overall tanker capacity will expand. Supply is also affected by the number of tankers being used for floating storage (which are thus not available to transport crude oil or petroleum products). Although currently only a relatively small percentage of the world tanker fleet is being used for storage at sea, that percentage varies over time, and is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with vessel use generally increasing when prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing when they are not. Any of these factors may cause both spot charter rates and the value of the INSW’s vessels to fluctuate, and may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\n​\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and INSW’s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\n​\nINSW’s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost and its vessel crews and shoreside employees are at risk of injury or death because of events including, but not limited to:\n\n●   marine disasters;\n---------------------\n\n●   bad weather;\n----------------\n\n●   mechanical failures;\n------------------------\n\n●   human error;\n----------------\n\n●   war, terrorism and piracy;\n------------------------------\n\n●   grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; and\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   other unforeseen circumstances or events.\n---------------------------------------------\n​\nThese hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; demand for the payment of ransoms; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to INSW’s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, any or all of which may also subject INSW to litigation. In addition, transporting crude oil and refined petroleum products creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. The operation of tankers also has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability of the oil transported in tankers. Furthermore, any such incident could seriously damage \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nINSW’s reputation and cause INSW either to lose business or to be less likely to be able to enter into new business (either because of customer concerns or changes in customer vetting processes). Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.\n​\nWhile the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed INSW’s $1.0 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, INSW may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and INSW cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company’s losses, INSW may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship or may suffer other consequential harm or difficulty in the event of a loss. INSW may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which INSW obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. INSW’s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.\n​\nCounterparty credit risk and constraints on capital availability may adversely affect INSW’s business.\n​\nCertain of the Company’s customers, financial lenders and suppliers may suffer material adverse impacts on their financial condition that could make them unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments, including the refusal or inability to pay charter hire to INSW or an inability or unwillingness to lend funds. While INSW seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that INSW may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations is limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on INSW’s revenues, profitability and cash flows.\n​\nThe Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on INSW’s ability to borrow funds. See also “— Risks Related to Our Company — The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings” and “— Risks Related to Our Company — INSW has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect INSW’s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.”\n​\nThe state of the global financial markets may adversely impact the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact the Company’s business.\n​\nGlobal financial markets have been, and continue to be, volatile. There have been periods where there was a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry, due to regulatory pressures (e.g., Basel IV) and the historically volatile asset values of vessels, exacerbated by individual companies’ exposure to the spot market (i.e., without fixed or locked in time charter coverage). As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it may be negatively affected by any such decline.\n​\nAlso, concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically may increase the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets. Lenders may also enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduce, and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when current facilities mature, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy, complete additional vessel acquisitions, or otherwise take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\n​\nINSW conducts its operations internationally, which subjects it to changing economic, political and governmental conditions that may adversely affect its business.\n​\nThe Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including:\n\n●   regional or local economic downturns;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in governmental policy or regulation;\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of countries in which INSW or its customers operate;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulty in staffing and managing (including ensuring compliance with internal policies and controls) geographically widespread operations;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   trade relations with foreign countries in which INSW’s customers and suppliers have operations, including protectionist measures such as tariffs and import or export licensing requirements;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   general economic and political conditions, which may interfere with, among other things, the Company’s supply chain, its customers and all of INSW’s activities in a particular location;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations in non-U.S. jurisdictions and the collection of accounts receivable from foreign accounts;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   different regulatory regimes in the various countries in which INSW operates;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the difficulties and increased expenses in complying with multiple and potentially conflicting U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, security rules, product approvals and trade standards, anti-bribery laws, government sanctions and restrictions on doing business with certain nations or specially designated nationals;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   import and export duties and quotas;\n----------------------------------------\n\n●   demands for improper payments from port officials or other government officials;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   U.S. and foreign customs, tariffs and taxes;\n------------------------------------------------\n\n●   currency exchange controls, restrictions and fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenue and increased operating expense;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   international incidents;\n----------------------------\n\n●   transportation delays or interruptions;\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   local conflicts, acts of war, terrorist attacks or military conflicts;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in oil prices or disruptions in oil supplies that could substantially affect global trade, the Company’s customers’ operations and the Company’s business;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the imposition of taxes by flag states, port states and jurisdictions in which INSW or its subsidiaries are incorporated or where its vessels operate; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expropriation of INSW’s vessels.\n------------------------------------\n​\nThe occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n​\nAdditionally, protectionist developments, or the perception they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Governments may turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing shipping demand. In particular, leaders in the United States have indicated the United States may seek to implement more protective trade measures and to withdraw from certain international trade treaties, including with China. Increasing trade protectionism may cause an increase in the cost of goods exported from regions globally, particularly the Asia-Pacific region and the risks associated with exporting goods, which may significantly affect the quantity of goods to be shipped, shipping time schedules, voyage costs and other associated costs. Further, increased tensions may adversely affect oil demand, which would have an adverse effect on shipping rates.\n​\nINSW must comply with complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; anti-money laundering laws; and competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company’s business operations and on the Company’s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company’s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although INSW has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, INSW cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. INSW’s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts.\n​\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\n​\nFuel is a significant expense in the Company’s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company’s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns and regulations, including requirements to use certain fuels that are more costly. \n​\nTerrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect INSW’s business.\n​\nTerrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company’s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters.  In addition, INSW operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effect of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities.  Political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region, in the Black Sea in connection with the war between Russia and Ukraine and in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in connection with the Israel/Gaza conflict resulting from attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants based in Yemen, respectively. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which have a material adverse effect on INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n​\nIn April 2019, Iran publicly threatened that it would interrupt the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz, the entrance to the Arabian Gulf.  Commencing in May 2019, several vessels in the Arabian Gulf have been attacked, which attacks the United States has attributed to Iranian forces, and at least two vessels have been seized by Iran.  Further the war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel/Gaza conflict have resulted in attacks on commercial vessels in the Black Sea, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in the 2022 – 2025 period. None of these attacks or seizures have involved the Company’s vessels. To date, these attacks and vessel seizures, while increasing the costs of the Company conducting its business to a limited extent, have not had a material adverse effect on INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow but no assurance can be given that continued vessel attacks or seizures will not do so.\n​\nActs of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company’s business.\n​\nThe threat of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains, particularly off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company’s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as “war risk” zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee “war and strikes” listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.\n​\nIn addition, while INSW believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not “on-hire” for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company’s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company’s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under their charters.\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\n​\nPublic health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.\n​\nPublic health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where INSW operates, could adversely impact the Company’s operations, the operations of the Company’s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for INSW’s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which INSW operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company’s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which INSW operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact INSW’s operations and adversely affect the Company’s financial results.\n​\n​\nRisks Related to Our Company\n​\nINSW has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect INSW’s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, INSW had approximately $688 million of outstanding indebtedness (including finance lease obligations), net of discounts and deferred finance costs. INSW’s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:\n\n●   limiting INSW’s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because INSW must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   to the extent INSW’s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limiting INSW’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limiting the Company’s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and INSW’s business and industry;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limiting INSW’s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   increasing INSW’s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nINSW’s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce or refinance debt in the future may be affected by, among other things, the age of the Company’s fleet and general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors. An inability to fund the Company’s debt requirements or reduce or refinance debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, for certain lease transactions, including finance leases, the Company’s ability to prepay the lease is restricted so the lease obligations may remain outstanding throughout the lease term even if it is financially advantageous for the Company to prepay the lease. \n​\nAdditionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company’s or its pools’ charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company’s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company’s inability to obtain additional financing at an acceptable cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company’s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.\n​\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities, term loans, and certain vessel charters.\n​\nThe Company’s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that INSW can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company’s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact INSW’s business.\n​\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nThe Company’s $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility and $160 Million Revolving Credit Facility contain customary representations, warranties, restrictions and covenants including financial covenants that require the Company (i) to maintain a minimum liquidity level of the greater of $50 million and 5% of the Company’s Consolidated Indebtedness; (ii) to ensure the Company’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ Maximum Leverage Ratio will not exceed 0.60 to 1.00 at any time; (iii) to ensure that Current Assets exceeds Current Liabilities (which is defined to exclude the current potion of Consolidated Indebtedness); and (iv) to ensure the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Collateral Vessels under each facility will not be less than 135% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each facility. Certain of the Company’s lease financing arrangements also contain similar financial covenants.\n​\nWhile the Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants, a decrease in vessel values or a failure to meet collateral maintenance requirements could cause the Company to breach certain covenants in its existing credit facilities, term loans and vessel leases, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company’s lenders could accelerate its debt and lenders could foreclose on the Company’s owned vessels and the owners of certain vessels that the Company charters in could terminate such charters.\n​\nA range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company’s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt and to meet the financial covenants under the Company’s debt facilities. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company’s control. If INSW does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\n●   refinancing or restructuring its debt;\n------------------------------------------\n\n●   selling tankers or other assets;\n------------------------------------\n\n●   reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   seeking to raise additional capital.\n----------------------------------------\n​\nUndertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow INSW to meet its debt obligations. The Company’s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict INSW’s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict INSW from adopting some alternative measures. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit INSW to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company’s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n​\nINSW is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligation or pay dividends.\n​\nInternational Seaways, Inc. is a holding company, and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends depends on its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of certain of the Company’s financing agreements restrict the ability of certain of those subsidiaries to distribute funds to International Seaways, Inc.\n​\nThe Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing.\n​\nThe Company’s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points in the tanker cycle. The Company currently has newbuilding construction contracts for the purchase of six dual fuel LNG ready LR1s which provide for installment payments of the purchase price to be made by the Company as the vessels are being built. If the Company is unable to fulfil its obligations under such contracts, the shipyard constructing such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nvessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n​\nThe Company depends on third-party service providers for technical and commercial management of its fleet.\n​\nThe Company currently outsources to third-party service providers certain management services of its fleet, including technical management, certain aspects of commercial management and crew management. In particular, the Company has entered into ship management agreements that assign technical management responsibilities to a third-party technical manager for each conventional tanker in the Company’s fleet (collectively, the “Ship Management Agreements”). The Company has also transferred commercial management of much of its fleet to certain other third-party service providers, principally commercial pools.\n​\nIn such outsourcing arrangements, the Company has transferred direct control over technical and commercial management of the relevant vessels, while maintaining significant oversight and audit rights, and must rely on third-party service providers to, among other things:\n\n●   comply with contractual commitments to the Company, including with respect to safety, quality and environmental compliance of the operations of the Company’s vessels;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   comply with requirements imposed by the U.S., the U.N., the U.K. and the EU (i) restricting calls on ports located in countries that are subject to sanctions and embargoes and (ii) prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   respond to changes in customer demands for the Company’s vessels;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   obtain supplies and materials necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Company’s vessels; and\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   mitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions relating to crews on the Company’s vessels.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nThe failure of third-party service providers to meet such commitments could lead to legal liability or other damages to the Company. The third-party service providers the Company has selected may not provide a standard of service comparable to that the Company would provide for such vessels if the Company directly provided such service. The Company relies on its third-party service providers to comply with applicable law, and a failure by such providers to comply with such laws may subject the Company to liability or damage its reputation even if the Company did not engage in the conduct itself. Furthermore, damage to any such third party service provider’s reputation, relationships or business may reflect on the Company directly or indirectly, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and business.\n​\nThe third-party technical managers have the right to terminate the Ship Management Agreements at any time with 90 days’ notice. If a third-party technical manager exercises that right, the Company will be required either to enter into substitute agreements with other third parties or to assume those management duties. The Company may not succeed in negotiating and entering into such agreements with other third parties and, even if it does so, the terms and conditions of such agreements may be less favorable to the Company. Furthermore, if the Company is required to dedicate internal resources to managing its fleet (including, but not limited to, hiring additional qualified personnel or diverting existing resources), that could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability. Any such changes could result in a temporary loss of customer approvals, could disrupt the Company’s business and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nINSW’s business depends on voyage charters, and any future decrease in spot charter rates could adversely affect its earnings.\n​\nVoyage charters, including vessels operating in commercial pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 86% of INSW’s aggregate TCE revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024, 91% in 2023 and 96% in 2022. Accordingly, INSW’s shipping revenues are significantly affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company’s vessels operate. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon tanker and oil supply and demand. The spot market is very volatile, and, in the past, there have been periods when spot charter rates have declined below the operating cost of vessels. The successful operation of INSW’s vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. If spot charter rates decline in the future, then INSW may be unable to operate its vessels trading in the spot market profitably, or meet its other obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage, which may last up to several weeks during periods in which spot charter rates are rising or falling, INSW will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from or experiencing the detriments of those changes. See also Item 1, “Business — Fleet Operations — Commercial Management.”\n​\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nINSW may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters.\n​\nINSW’s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2024, INSW employed 14 of its vessels on time charters, with expiration dates ranging between February 2025 and April 2030. The Company’s existing time charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters, INSW is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n​\nTermination of, or a change in the nature of, INSW’s relationship with any of the commercial pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, nine of the Company’s 13 VLCCs participate in the TI pool; 12 of its 13 Suezmaxes participate in the Maersk Tankers pool; three of the Company’s four Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool; all eight of its LR1s participate in the PI pool; and 30 of the 39 MRs participate in the CPTA pool or NTP pool. INSW’s participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company’s vessels through higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. Changes in the management of, and the terms of, these pools (including as a result of changes adopted in conjunction with the implementation of the EU Emission Trading System), decreases in the number of vessels participating in these pools, or the termination of these pools, could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability for the Company.\n​\nIn addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as commercial pools. While the Company believes that all the commercial pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in commercial pools.\n​\nIn the highly competitive international market, INSW may not be able to compete effectively for charters.\n​\nThe Company’s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than INSW. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. \n​\nINSW may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make in the future.\n​\nFrom time to time, INSW considers, and may make, acquisitions of individual vessels, groups of vessels, or shipping businesses. The success of any such acquisition will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include INSW’s ability to:\n\n●   identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   obtain financing;\n---------------------\n\n●   integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with INSW’s then-existing operations; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   enhance INSW’s customer base.\n---------------------------------\n​\nINSW intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt, other financing sources or bridge financing, any of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time INSW may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to INSW as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by INSW. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of INSW’s securities.\n​\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nAcquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:\n\n●   diversion of management time and attention from the Company’s existing business and other business opportunities;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into INSW’s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. INSW may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition, some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting INSW’s earnings.\n​\nThe smuggling or alleged smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company’s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company.\n​\nThe Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers may attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company’s vessels are found with or accused to be carrying contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessels and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, the Company may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, such events could have ancillary consequences under INSW’s financing and other agreements.\n​\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company’s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers.\n​\nIn general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average age of the Company’s total owned and operated fleet was 11.0 years (which excludes the six dual fuel LNG ready LR1s under construction and contracted for delivery to the Company during the third quarter of 2025 through the third quarter of 2026). In addition, older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of INSW’s currently operated vessels will rise as the age of the Company’s fleet increases. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require INSW to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel’s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a member. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, INSW may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit INSW to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in INSW’s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports until its class is restored or such failure is remedied. This would negatively impact the Company’s results of operation.\n​\nIn addition, the Company’s fleet includes a number of vessels purchased in the secondhand market or otherwise acquired after they have been constructed, such as through the Merger. While the Company typically inspects secondhand vessels before it purchases or otherwise acquires them, those inspections do not necessarily provide INSW with the same level of knowledge about those vessels’ condition that INSW would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by it. The Company may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels before purchase, which may lead to expensive, unanticipated repairs, and could even result in accidents or other incidents for which the Company could be liable.\n​\nFurthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, INSW is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nThese cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company’s vessels and have a material adverse effect on INSW’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n​\n​\nThe Company’s lightering business faces significant competition and market volatility, and revenues and profitability for these operations may vary significantly from period to period.\n​\nThe Company provides STS transfer services, primarily in the crude oil and refined petroleum products industries. The seaborne markets for STS transfer business are highly competitive and our competitors may in some cases have greater resources than we do.  The business also faces competition from alternative methods of delivering crude oil and refined petroleum products shipments to ports and vessels, including several offshore loading and offloading facilities either in operation or in various stages of planning in the USG region.  Furthermore, the market for STS transfer services faces different competitive dynamics than our other tanker businesses, meaning that our expertise in the tanker markets may not apply in the same ways to our lightering business, and demand for lightering services has historically varied significantly from period to period based on customer activity in the regions in which we operate.  Accordingly, our ability to maintain or grow our market share in STS transfer services may be limited, and the Company’s lightering revenues may be volatile or decline in the future.\n​\nThe Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings.\n​\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters voyage charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners’ compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (related to interest rate risk) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company’s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company’s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company’s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company’s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\n​\nThe Company relies on the skills of its senior management team, and if the Company were required to replace them, it could negatively impact the effectiveness of management and the Company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nINSW’s success depends to a significant extent upon the expertise, capabilities and efforts of its senior executives in managing the Company’s activities. INSW is led by executives with significant experience in their respective areas of responsibility, and the loss or unavailability of one or more of INSW’s senior executives for an extended period of time could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nThe Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels.\n​\nVessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company’s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and INSW’s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\n​\nTechnological innovation could reduce the Company’s charter income and the value of the Company’s vessels.\n​\nThe charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel’s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel’s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance, the impact of the stress of operations and new regulations (including in particular regulations relating to GHG emissions). If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company’s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the charter rates that the Company receives for its vessels and the resale value of the Company’s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\nThe Company stores, processes, maintains, and transmits confidential information through information technology (“IT”) systems. Cybersecurity issues, such as data breaches and computer malwares, affecting INSW’s IT systems or those of its third-party vendors, suppliers or counterparties, could disrupt INSW’s business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, disruption in regular business operations, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.\n​\nThe Company collects, stores and transmits sensitive and business critical data, including its own proprietary business information and that of its counterparties, and personally identifiable information of counterparties and employees, using both its own IT systems and those of third-party vendors. In addition, the Company relies on the transmission of similarly sensitive data from the Company’s third-party suppliers and vendors. The safe storage, accurate processing, timely availability and secure transmission of this information is critical to INSW’s operations. The Company’s dependency on IT systems includes accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, vessel operations, customer service, banking, payroll and messaging systems. The Company’s IT infrastructure, or those of its customers or third-party vendors, suppliers or counterparties, are vulnerable to data breaches, computer malwares, and other security problems as well as failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters or other unexpected problems. Many companies, including companies in the shipping industry, have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their information technology systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Company has experienced attempted attacks on its email system to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information.\n​\nThe Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to further protect itself and its systems against threats of security breaches and computer malware, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or malwares. Security breaches and malware could also expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of INSW’s third-party vendors, suppliers or counterparties to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in the Company’s IT systems and could adversely affect INSW’s reputation, cause losses to INSW or our customers, damage our brand, and increase our costs. In order to mitigate the financial impact of any losses arising from security breaches or computer malwares, the Company has purchased insurance that covers losses arising from such breaches or malwares, including data recovery, extortion, ransomware and business interruption.\n​\nINSW’s revenues are subject to seasonal variations.\n​\nINSW operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Peaks in tanker demand quite often precede seasonal oil consumption peaks, as refiners and suppliers anticipate consumer demand. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt tanker scheduling. Because a majority of the Company’s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected INSW’s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.\n​\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.\n​\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nThe process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company.\n​\nAny system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company’s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors’ perceptions that the Company’s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price.\n​\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions may adversely affect INSW’s operations.\n​\nINSW could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to INSW) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices or the failure of other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.\n​\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\n​\nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely affect our operating results. \nAn increasing concern for, and focus on climate change, has promoted extensive existing and proposed international, national and local regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with such regulations (including increased assessment, and greater reporting, of the environmental effects of our business) and our efforts to participate in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (“GHGs”) will likely increase our compliance costs, require significant capital expenditures to reduce vessel emissions and require changes to our business.\nOur business consists of transporting crude oil and refined petroleum products. Regulatory changes and growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change may lead to reduced demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products and decreased demand for our services, while increasing or creating greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. We expect regulatory and consumer efforts aimed at combating climate change to intensify and accelerate. Although we do not expect demand for oil to decline dramatically over the short-term, in the long-term climate change likely will significantly affect demand for oil and for alternatives. Any such change could adversely affect our ability to compete in a changing market and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that capital expenditures we make to comply with existing or proposed environmental regulations or strategies that we adopt with respect to changes in demand for crude oil or refined petroleum products or in demand for our services will be successful. \nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our sustainability and governance policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their sustainability and governance policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on such practices and, in recent years, have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. The increased focus and activism related to these matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s practices. Diminished access to capital could hinder our growth. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for these issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and their business, financial condition and share price may be adversely affected.\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, which are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors remain invested in us and make further investments in us, especially given our business of transporting crude oil and refined petroleum products. \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with wide-ranging sustainability and governance requirements. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nCompliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect INSW’s business.\n​\nGeneral\n​\nThe Company’s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which INSW’s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels’ registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on INSW, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.\n​\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company’s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, United States and international laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, INSW could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. INSW could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company’s vessels.\n​\nOil Pollution\n​\nINSW could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the EPA. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. \n​\nIn addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water.\n​\nBallast Water\n​\nCertain of the Company’s vessels are subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water under the EPA’s VGP, with additional vessels becoming subject in future years, even though those vessels have obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under the USCG’s final rules. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but has stated that vessels that (i) have received an extension from the USCG, (ii) are in compliance with all of the VGP requirements other than numeric discharge limits and (iii) meet certain other requirements will be entitled to “low enforcement priority”. While INSW believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water meets the conditions for “low enforcement priority,” no assurance can be given that they will do so. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on INSW. Further, it is anticipated that in 2026 the \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nUSCG will implement regulations under VIDA at which time the discharge of ballast water in the navigable waters of the United States will no longer be subject to the VGP. See Item 1, “Business —Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.”\n​\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\n​\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the U.N., have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company’s business, including requiring INSW to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, “Business — Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping”. \n​\nOther Impacts\n​\nOther government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to recycle or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to INSW’s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and international regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nAccidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company’s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on INSW’s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company’s management deems appropriate. The vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel’s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.\n​\n​\nEmployment of the Company’s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors’ risk assessment process.\n​\nThe shipping industry, and especially vessels that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products, is heavily regulated. In addition, the “oil majors” such as BP, Chevron Corporation, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell and Total S.A. have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel, including audits of the management office and physical inspections of the ship. Under the terms of the Company’s charter agreements (including those entered into by pools in which the Company participates), the Company’s charterers require that the Company’s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits, respectively. The Company’s failure to maintain any of its vessels to the standards required by the oil majors could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should the Company not be able to successfully clear the oil majors’ risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of the Company’s vessels could also be adversely affected. since it might lead to the oil majors’ terminating existing charters.\n​\nThe Company’s vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S., the U.N., the U.K. or the EU, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company’s common shares.\n​\nFrom time to time, certain of the Company’s vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries or territories, and/or operated by \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\npersons, subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S., the U.N., the U.K. or the EU and countries identified by the U.S., the U.N., the U.K. or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., U.N., the U.K. and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran, Venezuela and Russia), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or is otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power themselves becoming the target of sanctions.\n​\nAlthough INSW believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intends to maintain such compliance, and INSW does not, and does not intend to, engage in sanctionable activity, INSW might fail to comply or may inadvertently engage in a sanctionable activity in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect INSW’s reputation and investor perception of the value of INSW’s common stock.\n​\n​\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company’s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it.\n​\nThe Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, sanctions and other regulatory compliance, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company’s business. \n​\nAlthough the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to INSW’s insurance costs, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company’s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 19, “Contingencies,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n​\nMaritime claimants could arrest INSW’s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows.\n​\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company’s vessels could interrupt INSW’s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the “sister ship” theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant’s maritime lien and any “associated” vessel, meaning any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert “sister ship” liability against one vessel in the Company’s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n​\nGovernments could requisition the Company’s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\n​\nA government could requisition one or more of the Company’s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\neffectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of one or more of the Company’s vessels may negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\n​\nWe may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on U.S. source shipping income, which would reduce our net income and cash flows.\n​\nIf we do not qualify for an exemption pursuant to Section 883, or the “Section 883 exemption,” of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) then we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our shipping income that is derived from U.S. sources. If we are subject to such tax, our results of operations and cash flows would be reduced by the amount of such tax. We will qualify for the Section 883 exemption for 2025 and forward if, among other things, (i) our common shares are treated as primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States or another qualified country (“publicly traded test”), or (ii) we satisfy one of two other ownership tests. Under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, the publicly traded test will not be satisfied in any taxable year in which persons who directly, indirectly or constructively own five percent or more of our common shares (sometimes referred to as “5% shareholders”) own in the aggregate 50% or more of the vote and value of our common shares for more than half the days in such year, unless an exception applies. We can provide no assurance that ownership of our common shares by 5% shareholders will allow us to qualify for the Section 883 exemption in 2025 and any other future taxable years. If we do not qualify for the Section 883 exemption, our gross shipping income derived from U.S. sources, i.e., 50% of our gross shipping income attributable to transportation beginning or ending in the United States (but not both beginning and ending in the United States), generally would be subject to a four percent tax without allowance for deductions.\n​\nU.S. tax authorities could treat us as a “passive foreign investment company,” which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders.\n​\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company,” or a “PFIC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, after applying certain look through rules, either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of “passive income” or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of assets (determined on a quarterly basis) held for the production of “passive income.” We refer to assets which produce or are held for production of “passive income” as “passive assets.” For purposes of these tests, “passive income” generally includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rental income and royalties other than rental income and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business, as defined in applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. Passive income does not include income derived from the performance of services. Although there is no authority under the PFIC rules directly on point, and existing legal authority in other contexts is inconsistent in its treatment of time charter income, we believe that the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time and spot chartering activities is services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that (i) our income from time and spot chartering activities does not constitute passive income and (ii) the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets. Therefore, we believe that we are not now and have never been a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. There is no assurance that the IRS or a court of law will accept our position and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, because there are uncertainties in the application of the PFIC rules and PFIC status is determined annually and is based on the composition of a company’s income and assets (which are subject to change), we can provide no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether we remain as a PFIC for subsequent taxable years), our U.S. shareholders would be subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to distributions received from us and gain, if any, derived from the sale or other disposition of our common shares. These adverse tax consequences to shareholders could negatively impact our ability to issue additional equity in order to raise the capital necessary for our business operations.\n​\nPending and future tax law changes may result in significant additional taxes to us.\n​\nTax laws, including tax rates, in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control and may result in significant additional taxes to us. For example, various governments and organizations such as the EU and Organization for Economic Co-operation Development (or the OECD) are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. In January 2019, the OECD announced further work in continuation of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, focusing on two “pillars”. Pillar One provides a framework for the reallocation of certain residual profits of multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed. Pillar Two consists of two interrelated rules referred to as Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which operate to impose a minimum tax rate of 15% calculated on a jurisdictional basis. The Pillar Two Model Rules are designed to ensure that large multinational enterprises (MNEs) \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nthat have annual revenues of €750 million or more in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. In October 2021, more than 130 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. The framework calls for law enactment by OECD and G20 members in 2022 to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Qualifying International Shipping Income is exempt from many aspects of this framework if the exemption requirements are satisfied. As currently drafted, the exemption requirements are limited to the extent strategic and/or commercial management of ships are carried on from within the jurisdiction in which the ship owning and revenue generating entity is domiciled. On December 20, 2021, the OECD published model rules to implement the Pillar Two rules, which are generally consistent with the agreement reached by the framework in October 2021. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on large multinational enterprises with revenues of at least €750 million, which became effective in 2024. A number of countries have adopted the OECD’s minimum tax rules and have implemented these rules or local versions of these rules effective January 1, 2024. None of the Company’s subsidiaries are domiciled in such jurisdictions as of December 31, 2024, however. these laws as enacted and implemented could result in additional tax imposed on us or our subsidiaries if we or our subsidiaries decide to do business from such jurisdictions in the future.\n​\nIn addition, national or local tax authorities may assert other claims in various circumstances. During 2023, the tax authorities in one country notified many international shipping companies, including the Company, that they may have failed to comply with extant laws applicable in such country with respect to registration, reporting possible income derived from such country, filing of appropriate tax returns, and payment of relevant taxes with respect to international shipping operations. While the law has been in place for many years, there has not been any previous enforcement and there is significant lack of clarity as to who may be subject to tax under the legislation and what income, if any, may be subject to taxation. Similarly, the status of the taxation of international shipping income in certain other countries is equally uncertain. The Company believes that any income tax liability that may arise in all such countries would not be material to the Company, but no assurance can be made as to the amount of any such liability, if any.\n​\n​\nRisks Related to the Common Stock\n​\nWe are incorporated in the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate case law or bankruptcy law, and, as a result, shareholders may have fewer rights and protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States.\n​\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (the \"BCA\"). The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the law of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain U.S. jurisdictions. Shareholder rights may differ as well. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, the Marshall Islands does not have a well-developed body of bankruptcy law. As such, in the case of a bankruptcy involving us, there may be a delay of bankruptcy proceedings and the ability of securityholders and creditors to receive recovery after a bankruptcy proceeding, and any such recovery may be less predictable.\n​\nIt may be difficult to serve process on or enforce a United States judgment against us, our officers and our directors because we are a foreign corporation.\n​\nWe are a corporation formed in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In addition, a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, you may have difficulty serving legal process within the United States upon us. You may also have difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against us or our directors and officers, including in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Furthermore, there is substantial doubt that the courts of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which our offices are located would enter judgments in original actions brought in those courts predicated on U.S. federal or state securities laws.\n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\n​\n​\nThe market price of the Company’s securities may fluctuate significantly.\n​\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the market price of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your common stock at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this “Risk Factors” section and under “Forward -Looking Statements,” as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company’s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company’s competitors; changes in the Company’s relationships with the Company’s customers or the Company’s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company’s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors’ general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company’s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. Any of the foregoing factors could also cause the price of the Company’s equity securities to fall and may expose the Company to securities class action litigation. Any securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n​\nIn addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock, regardless of its actual operating performance.\n​\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company’s business, the price and/or trading volume of shares of the Company’s common stock could decline.\n​\nThe trading market for shares of the Company’s common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about the Company and its business. If too few analysts commence and maintain coverage of the Company, the trading price for its shares might be adversely affected. Similarly, if analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company’s business, the price and/or trading volume of shares of the Company’s common stock could decline.\n​\nOur limited duration Amended and Restated Stockholders Rights plan dated as of April 11, 2023 (the “Amended and Restated Rights Plan”), also known as a “poison pill”, may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of the Company’s common stock.\n​\nThe Amended and Restated Rights Plan is intended to enable all Company stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment in the Company. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan reduces the likelihood that any person or group gains control of the Company through open market accumulation, or other tactics potentially disadvantaging the interests of all stockholders, without paying all stockholders an appropriate control premium or providing the Company’s Board of Directors sufficient time to make informed decisions in the best interests of all stockholders. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan was ratified by the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 6, 2023. While the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement was effective immediately, the Rights become exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership, as defined in the Rights Agreement, of 20% or more of the Company’s common stock in a transaction not approved by the Company's Board of Directors. In that situation, each holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group) will have the right to purchase, upon payment of the then-current exercise price, a number of shares of Company common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price of the Right. In addition, at any time after a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company’s common stock (unless such person or group acquires 50% or more), the Company’s Board of Directors may exchange one share of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding Right (other than Rights owned by such person or group, which would have become null and void). The Amended and Restated Rights Plan is not intended to interfere with any transaction that the Board of Directors determines is in the best interests of stockholders, nor does the Amended and Restated Rights Plan prevent the Board of Directors from considering any proposal. The Amended and Restated Rights Plan will expire on April 10, 2026, subject to earlier termination by the Company’s Board of Directors if the Board determines that market and other conditions warrant. \n​\nNotwithstanding the foregoing advantages provided by the Amended and Restated Rights Plan to the interests of all stockholders, the Amended and Restated Rights Plan may depress the market price of the Company’s common stock by acting to discourage, delay or \n\n\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\n\n\n\nprevent a change of control of the Company or changes in the management of the Company that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous.\n​\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by the Company may materially adversely affect the share price, and future capitalization measures could lead to substantial dilution of existing stockholders’ interests in the Company.\n​\nThe Company may seek to raise additional equity through the issuance of new shares or convertible or exchangeable bonds to finance future organic growth or acquisitions. Increasing the number of issued shares would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Stockholders’ ownership interests could also be diluted if other companies or equity interests in companies are acquired in exchange for new shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued and if the Company’s Board of Directors makes grants of equity awards to the Company’s directors, officers and employees pursuant to any equity incentive or compensation plan, any such grants would also cause dilution.\n​\nINSW may not continue to pay cash dividends on its Common Stock.\n​\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022 INSW paid regular quarterly and supplemental cash dividends totaling $284.4 million or $5.77 per share, $308.2 million or $6.29 per share, and $69.8 million or $1.42 per share, respectively. Any future determinations to pay dividends on its Common Stock will be at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including INSW’s future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors its Board of Directors may deem relevant. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of INSW’s Board of Directors. INSW has no obligation to, and may not be able to, declare or pay dividends on its Common Stock. If INSW does not declare and pay dividends on its Common Stock, its share price could decline.\n​\n​\n​",
