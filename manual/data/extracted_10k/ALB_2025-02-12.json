We believe that our world-class resources with reliable and consistent supply, our leading process chemistry, high-impact innovation, customer centricity and focus on people and planet will enable us to maintain a leading position in the industries in which we operate.\n\nWe and our joint ventures currently operate more than 25 production and research and development (“R&D”) facilities, as well as a number of administrative and sales offices, around the world. As of December 31, 2024, we served approximately 1,900 customers in approximately 70 countries. For information regarding our unconsolidated joint ventures, see Note 8, “Investments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n\nEffective November 1, 2024, we transitioned our operating structure from two core global business units - Energy Storage and Specialties - to a fully integrated functional model designed to increase agility, deliver significant cost savings and maintain long-term competitiveness. In addition, our Ketjen business continues to be operated under a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary. We will continue to report results across three existing operating segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nDuring 2024, we managed and reported our operations under three reportable segments: Energy Storage, Specialties and Ketjen. The segments are organized based on their similar markets, customers, economic characteristics and production processes. Financial results and discussion about our segments included in this report are organized according to these categories except where noted.\n\nFor financial information regarding our reportable segments and geographic area information, see Note 25, “Segment and Geographic Area Information,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n\nEnergy Storage Segment\n\nOur Energy Storage business enables better lithium use through reliable supply and consistent quality. We develop and manufacture a broad range of basic lithium compounds, including lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, and lithium chloride. Lithium is a key component in products and processes used in a variety of applications and industries, which include lithium batteries used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles, power grids and solar panels, high performance greases, specialty glass used in consumer appliances and electronics, organic synthesis processes in the areas of steroid chemistry and vitamins, various life science applications, as well as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry, among other applications.\n\nIn addition to developing and supplying lithium compounds, we provide technical services, including the handling and use of reactive lithium products. We also offer our customers recycling services for lithium-containing by-products resulting from synthesis with organolithium products, lithium metal and other reagents. We plan to continue to focus on the development of new products and applications.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe global lithium market is highly competitive and growing very rapidly. It is characterized by aggressive expansion and entry from existing and new players, including automotive OEMs, commodity traders, junior miners, and large, well-capitalized diversified miners. Producers are primarily located in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. Major competitors in lithium compounds include Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., Sichuan Tianqi Lithium, Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, Rio Tinto plc, Pilbara Minerals, Arcadium Lithium, Tesla and a large number of additional Chinese companies. Competition in the global lithium market is increasingly based on index-based market pricing and differentiated via product quality, product diversity, reliability of supply and customer service.\n\n3\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\n\nWe obtain lithium: (a) by purchasing lithium concentrate from our 49%-owned joint venture, Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd. (“Windfield”), which directly owns 100% of the equity of Talison Lithium Pty. Ltd., a company incorporated in Australia (“Talison”) that owns the Greenbushes mine, and from our 50%-owned unincorporated joint venture, MARBL Lithium Joint Venture (“MARBL”) in Western Australia, which owns the Wodgina hard rock lithium mine project (“Wodgina”); and (b) through solar evaporation of our ponds at the Salar de Atacama, in Chile, and in Silver Peak, Nevada. In addition, we hold mineral rights in defined areas of Kings Mountain, North Carolina with available lithium resources and we own undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures of our lithium mineral properties.\n\nSpecialties Segment\n\nOur Specialties business optimizes our portfolio of bromine and highly specialized lithium solutions. Our Specialties business serves a variety of industries, including energy, mobility, connectivity, and health. Specialty products are essential in both internal combustion and electric vehicles, from high-voltage cables and powertrains to airbags and tires. We enable digital innovation focused on safety and reliability, including fire safety compounds. Our fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in high performance, high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials. End market products that benefit from our fire safety technology include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics, printed circuit boards, wire and cable products, electrical connectors, textiles and foam insulation. In energy, infrastructure for renewable grid and electrified transport is enabled by our fire safety solutions. In health, our lithium specialties products are precursors for many pharmaceuticals, while bromine specialties are used to help ensure safer food and water supplies. Other bromine-based specialty chemicals products include elemental bromine, alkyl bromides, inorganic bromides, brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals. Our value-added lithium specialties products include butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride. We also develop and manufacture cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and zirconium, barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications, including airbag initiators. A number of customers of our Specialties business operate in cyclical industries, including the consumer electronics and oil field industries. As a result, demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur Specialties business serves markets in the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Product performance and quality, price and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified supplier is awarded a contract. R&D, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and maintenance of a good safety record have also been important factors to compete effectively in the marketplace. Our most significant competitors are Lanxess AG, Israel Chemicals Ltd and Arcadium Lithium, as well as producers in India and China.\n\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\n\nThe bromine we use is originally sourced from two locations: Arkansas and the Dead Sea. Our bromine production operations in Arkansas are supported by an active brine rights leasing program. In addition, through our 50% interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited (“JBC”), a consolidated joint venture established in 1999 with operations in Safi, Jordan, we acquire bromine that is originally sourced from the Dead Sea. JBC processes the bromine at its facilities into a variety of end products. See Item 2. Properties, for additional disclosures for our mineral properties. The lithium concentrate used in our lithium specialties products are originally sourced from the same sources as the Energy Storage lithium concentrate noted above.\n\nKetjen Segment\n\nOur three main product lines in this segment are (i) Clean Fuels Technologies (“CFT”), which is primarily composed of hydroprocessing catalysts (“HPC”) together with isomerization and alkylation catalysts; (ii) fluidized catalytic cracking (“FCC”) catalysts and additives; and (iii) performance catalyst solutions (“PCS”), which is primarily composed of organometallics and curatives. \n\nWe offer a wide range of HPC products, which are applied throughout the oil refining industry. Their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur, nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock. In addition, they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes. We continuously seek to add more value to refinery operations by offering HPC products that meet our customers’ requirements for profitability and performance in the very demanding refining market. \n\n4\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nWe provide our customers with customized FCC catalyst systems, which assist in the high yield cracking of refinery petroleum streams into derivative, higher-value products such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene. Our FCC additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield, such as propylene, and to boost octane in gasoline. Ketjen offers unique refinery catalysts to crack and treat the lightest to the heaviest feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs.\n\nWithin our PCS product line, we manufacture organometallic co-catalysts (e.g., aluminum, magnesium, and zinc alkyls) used in the manufacture of alpha-olefins (e.g., hexene, octene, decene), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), and electronics. Our curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes, epoxies and other engineered resins.\n\nThere were more than 700 refineries world-wide as of December 31, 2024. We expect to continue to see some less profitable, typically smaller, refineries shutting down and, over the long-term, being replaced by larger scale and more complex refineries, with growth concentrated in the Middle East, India and South-East Asia. Advances in sustainable aviation fuels, petroleum products and renewable diesel are expected to continue. We estimate that there are currently approximately 600 FCC units being operated globally, each of which requires a constant supply of FCC catalysts. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 4,000 HPC units being operated globally, each of which typically requires replacement HPC catalysts once every one to four years.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur Ketjen segment serves the global market including the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, each of which is highly competitive. Competition in these markets is driven by a variety of factors. Product performance, quality, price, contract terms, product and process improvements, specialized customer services, the ability to attract and retain skilled technical support, and the maintenance of a good safety record are the primary factors to compete effectively in the catalysts marketplace. In addition, through our research and development programs, we strive to differentiate our business by developing value-added products based on proprietary technologies.\n\nOur major competitors in the CFT catalysts market include Shell Catalysts & Technologies, Advanced Refining Technologies and Haldor Topsoe. Our major competitors in the FCC catalysts market include W.R. Grace & Co. and BASF Corporation. In the PCS market, our major competitors include Nouryon, Lanxess AG and Arxada.\n\nRaw Materials and Significant Supply Sources\n\nThe major raw materials we use in our Ketjen operations include sodium silicate, sodium aluminate, kaolin, aluminum, ethylene, alpha-olefins, isobutylene, toluene and metals, such as lanthanum, molybdenum, nickel and cobalt, most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices we believe are competitive. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools, as appropriate, to mitigate price volatility.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nOur main human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe, supported and empowered to do the best work they can do. We believe providing an inclusive workplace facilitates opportunities for innovation, fosters good decision-making practices, and promotes employee engagement and high productivity across our organization.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,300 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures, of whom 3,300, or 39%, are employed in the U.S. and the Americas; 2,900, or 35%, are employed in Asia Pacific; 1,500, or 19%, are employed in Europe; and 600, or 7%, are employed in the Middle East or other areas. Approximately 28% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. We strive to foster positive relationships with our employees and their representatives.\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of our employees is a part of our core values at Albemarle and is integral to how we conduct business. Our employees, contractors, and visitors are instructed to follow a comprehensive set of written health and safety policies and procedures at both corporate and local sites. Our internal incident and issues management system gives all employees the ability to report incidents anonymously without fear of retaliation, and allow us to be more proactive in developing safety programs that address at-risk conditions or behaviors, which could lead to an incident. We routinely audit ourselves against our policies, procedures and standards, using internal and third-party resources. We also include health and safety metrics in our annual incentive plan to further incentivize our employees’ commitment to safety. In 2024, we maintained \n\n5\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nour Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.13 for our employees and nested contractors, compared to 0.14 in 2023. In addition, we provide all employees and their dependents with access to our Employee Assistance Program, which provides free mental and behavioral health resources.\n\nTalent and Culture\n\nInvesting in talent is a critical process for Albemarle because it allows us to be proactive and anticipate key organizational needs for talent and capabilities. This enables us to efficiently and effectively ensure that we have the right talent pipeline to drive Albemarle’s success into the future. We also provide leadership development through performance coaching, comprehensive feedback, plant training including health, safety and environmental topics, and experiential development and mentoring. Our leadership development is a cornerstone to our talent management strategy. We also invest in our people through enhanced training and development opportunities and by seeking to foster an equitable workplace and an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel a sense of belonging and reach their full potential.\n\nIt is important for us to have a workforce of highly engaged employees who understand how their work connects to Albemarle’s purpose and values. We have measured employee engagement through an empowerment survey, which tracks job satisfaction and how likely an employee is to recommend Albemarle to people they know. In addition, we are committed to empowering and supporting the next generation of talent in their career development by engaging in various initiatives to attract people from all backgrounds to our internship, co-op and rotational development programs. \n\nOur incentive program is designed to provide incentives and rewards for achieving Albemarle’s annual goals and objectives. The Executive Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board has the overall responsibility of evaluating the performance of the CEO and approving the compensation structure for senior management and other key employees. The Executive Compensation and Talent Development Committee determines performance goals under our incentive program annually to ensure our executive officers execute on short-term financial and strategic initiatives that drive our business strategy and long-term shareholder value.\n\nWe develop holistic inclusion and belonging initiatives to foster a values-driven workplace where all individuals feel a sense of belonging as they grow in their professions. We continue to pursue strategies and partnerships to attract highly qualified applicants from all backgrounds, offer cross-cultural learning sessions for our employees, and assess promotion, retention, and turnover data to identify potential opportunities for greater inclusion efforts. \n\nWe seek to provide employees with a desirable workplace that will enable us to attract and retain top talent. We believe employees should be fairly compensated through wages and benefits, based on experience, expertise, performance, and the criticality of their roles in the Company. We also perform an annual review of our pay practices to ensure that they are fair and equitable. In addition, we have established employee resource groups, known as Connect groups, to promote an atmosphere of inclusion and encouragement in which every employee’s voice can be heard. These Connect groups provide opportunities for employees to share their backgrounds and experiences, and to use them to benefit others through mentoring and volunteering in the local community, among other activities.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nAlbemarle is guided by its Code of Conduct, which sets forth the high ethical standards we have for all employees and encourages a ‘Speak Up’ culture. We understand our responsibility to uphold the human rights of our employees, workers in our supply chain, members of our communities and other stakeholders. We recognize the human rights of our stakeholders as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We acknowledge the human rights of Indigenous Peoples in culturally sensitive locations, such as Chile and Western Australia, where our sites are located on Indigenous Peoples’ lands through clear policy commitments, due diligence initiatives, formal community agreements and accessible grievance mechanisms for reporting concerns.\n\nAlbemarle offers multiple avenues for employees and stakeholders to raise concerns. We maintain internal investigation standards to thoroughly review and address concerns that may arise. We take measures to maintain confidentiality, protect the integrity of all investigations, and prevent retaliation against those who speak up in good faith. In conducting investigations, we are committed to the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\n\nWe have an international strategic account program that uses cross-functional teams to serve large global customers. This program emphasizes creative strategies to improve and strengthen strategic customer relationships with emphasis on creating \n\n6\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nvalue for customers and promoting post-sale service. Complementing this program are regional Albemarle sales and technical personnel who serve our global customer base. We also utilize sales representatives and specialists in specific market areas when necessary or required by law.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nWe believe that in order to generate revenue growth, maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, product and process improvements and specialized customer services. Our research and development efforts support each of our business segments. The objective of our research and development efforts is to develop innovative chemistries and technologies with applications relevant within targeted key markets through both process and new product development. Through research and development, we continue to seek increased margins by introducing value-added products and proprietary processes and innovative green chemistry technologies. Our green chemistry efforts focus on the development of products in a manner that minimizes waste and the use of raw materials and energy, avoids the use of toxic reagents and solvents and utilizes safe, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. Green chemistry is encouraged with our researchers through periodic focus group discussions and special rewards and recognition for outstanding new green developments.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, licenses and trade names, is an important component of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we owned more than 1,650 active patents and more than 400 pending patent applications in key strategic markets worldwide. We also have acquired rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses, and we license certain patents and inventions to third parties. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\n\nRegulation\n\nOur business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations, including those under the OSHA. We also are subject to similar state laws and regulations as well as local laws and regulations for our non-U.S. operations. We devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees, and we maintain an active health, safety and environmental program. We finished 2024 with an OSHA occupational injury and illness incident rate of 0.13 for Albemarle employees and nested contractors, compared to 0.14 in 2023.\n\nOur business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process. Authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the European Union require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations.\n\nThe Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), as amended in June 2016, requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calls for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, will potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products.\n\nHistorically, there has been scrutiny of certain brominated fire safety solutions by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated fire safety solution products, which are used in a variety of applications. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation or reaction in our markets independent of regulation.\n\n7\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us. Key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations. In addition, we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them.\n\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims for personal injury and/or property damage relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. We are subject to such laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U.S., and similar foreign and state laws. We may have liability as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) with respect to active off-site locations under CERCLA or state equivalents. We have sought to resolve our liability as a PRP at these sites through indemnification by third parties and settlements, which would provide for payment of our allocable share of remediation costs. Because the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required, and in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability, our estimates could change. Moreover, liability under CERCLA and equivalent state statutes may be joint and several, which could require us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been considered, where appropriate, in estimating our liabilities. Accruals for these matters are included in the environmental reserve. Our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and, based on information currently available to us, we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not have a material effect on our operations.\n\nSee “Safety and Environmental Matters” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.\n\nClimate Change and Natural Resources\n\nThe growing concerns about climate change and the related increasingly stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities. We provide solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies (such as renewable fuels), pollution control technologies (including mercury emissions), alternative transportation vehicles and energy storage technologies and other similar solutions. As demand for, and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of, alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase, we continue to monitor the market and offer solutions where we have appropriate technology and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such demand or legislation.\n\nIn addition to potential business opportunities, we acknowledge our responsibility to address the impact of our operations on the environment. We are investing in technology and people to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and air emissions. Albemarle supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to avoid climate change by limiting global warming. Our ambition is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have established greenhouse gas emission targets for each of our businesses, including reducing the scope 1 and 2 carbon-intensity of our Specialties and Ketjen businesses by 35% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline), and growing our Energy Storage business in a carbon-intensity neutral manner through 2030.\n\nWater is a critical input to Albemarle’s production operations. As water is a scarce resource, we understand the need to responsibly manage our water consumption not only for the preservation of the environment, but also for the viability of our local communities. We are investing in new process technologies to reduce our water footprint and expand capacity sustainably in locations with high water risk. Our goal is to reduce our intensity of freshwater usage by 25% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline) in areas of high or extremely high water risk, such as Chile and Jordan, as defined by the World Resources Institute.\n\nOur businesses are dependent on the availability and responsible management of natural resources. We manage our natural resources to operate efficiently and preserve the environment for our local communities and the world. Our natural \n\n8\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nresource management includes mineral resource transparency with local communities, governments, regulators and other key stakeholders, as well as leveraging industry best practices in lithium production for the assurance of responsible mining. We attempt to maximize the recovery of our extracted minerals and recycle or reuse by-products where possible. In addition, we work with local communities, regulatory agencies and wildlife organizations to preserve and restore land and biodiversity before, during and after all operations commence.\n\nRecent Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Divestitures\n\nThe following is a summary of our significant acquisitions and joint venture agreement restructurings over the last three years.\n\nOn October 18, 2023, the Company closed on the restructuring of the MARBL joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited (“MRL”). Under the amended agreements, Albemarle acquired the remaining 40% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia that was jointly owned with MRL through the MARBL joint venture. Following this restructuring, Albemarle and MRL each own 50% of Wodgina, and MRL operates the Wodgina mine on behalf of the joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Albemarle paid MRL approximately $380 million in cash, which includes $180 million of consideration for the remaining ownership of Kemerton as well as a payment for the economic effective date of the transaction being retroactive to April 1, 2022.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. (“Qinzhou”), for approximately $200 million in cash. Qinzhou’s operations include a recently constructed lithium processing plant strategically positioned near the Port of Qinzhou in Guangxi, which began commercial production in the first half of 2022. The plant has a designed annual conversion capacity of up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) and produces battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide.\n\nThese transactions reflect our commitment to investing in future growth of our high priority businesses.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nOur website address is www.albemarle.com.

key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n•Some of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\n\n•Our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures.\n\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\n\n•Our required capital expenditures can be complex, may experience delays or other difficulties, and the costs may exceed our estimates.\n\n•We will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\n\n•Because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\n•Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business.\n\n•Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing, the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations.\n\n•Write-offs or impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets can result in significant charges to earnings.\n\n10\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n•Our business could suffer if we are not successful in executing our strategy and initiatives in connection with our comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure.\n\n•We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\n\n•Significant or prolonged periods of higher interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n•Inflationary trends in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n•Changes in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results.\n\n•Future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and U.S. deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\n\n•Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\n\n•Although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business.\n\n•We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\n\n•We may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness related to acquisitions.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n•Adverse conditions in the economy, and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n•Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches, information technology system failures, or network disruptions.\n\n•The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products.\n\n•National or international disputes, political instability, terrorism war or armed hostilities, could impact our results of operations.\n\n•Natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\n•Our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures.\n\n•We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\n\n•Failure to meet sustainability expectations or standards or achieve our sustainability goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nYou should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S., with approximately 83% of our net sales to foreign countries. We operate in, and/or sell our products to customers in, approximately 70 countries. We currently have many production, research and development and administrative facilities as well as sales offices located outside the U.S., as detailed in Item 2. Properties. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include the following:\n\n•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;\n\n11\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n•transportation and other shipping costs may increase, or transportation may be inhibited;\n\n•increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials;\n\n•increased regulations on, or reduced access to, scarce resources, such as freshwater; \n\n•changes in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed, impose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits;\n\n•delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification of existing contracts, leases, licenses, permits or other agreements and/or approvals;\n\n•trade sanctions by or against foreign countries in which we do business could result in our losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries;\n\n•unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur;\n\n•our agreements with counterparties in foreign countries may be difficult for us to enforce and related receivables may be difficult for us to collect;\n\n•compliance with the variety of foreign laws and regulations may be unduly burdensome;\n\n•compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) as well as anti-money-laundering laws may be costly;\n\n•compliance with changing cybersecurity rules and evolving data privacy rules and regulation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, could increase our cost of doing business;\n\n•unexpected adverse changes in export regulations, duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses may occur;\n\n•general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;\n\n•changes in the strength of our relationships with local communities and indigenous populations in the areas in which we operate may impact our community support;\n\n•our foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes;\n\n•termination or substantial modification of international trade agreements may adversely affect our access to raw materials and to markets for our products outside the U.S.;\n\n•foreign governments may nationalize or expropriate private enterprises; \n\n•increased sovereign risk (such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments) may occur; and\n\n•political or economic repercussions from terrorist activities, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability, may occur in certain countries in which we do business.\n\nThe U.S. and foreign countries may also adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in U.S. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries).\n\nIn addition, certain of our operations and ongoing capital projects are in regions of the world such as Asia, the Middle East and South America that are of high risk due to significant civil, political and security instability. Unanticipated events, such as geopolitical changes, could result in a write-down of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects, which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery and antitrust prohibitions of the U.S. and other countries, as well as export controls and economic embargoes, violations of which may carry substantial penalties. For example, export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us or our subsidiaries to fines and enforcement actions and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock. Relating to anti-bribery prohibitions, in September 2023, we finalized agreements with regulatory agencies to resolve self-reported potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; see “We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.” below.\n\n12\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nBecause we conduct substantial operations in China, risks associated with regulatory activity and political and social events in China could negatively affect our business and operating results.\n\nIn 2024, net sales shipped to China represented 36% of our total net sales. Additionally, we own four production facilities located in China, including the lithium conversion plant in Meishan, China, which began production in 2024. In addition to the risks described above under “Our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”, our operations in China expose us to risks particular to conducting business in that country. For example, over the past several years the U.S. and China have applied tariffs to certain of each other’s exports, including tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries announced by the U.S. presidential administration in 2024, which have resulted in, and may continue to cause, shifting trade flows and restrictions on certain sales of goods into China and domestic demand for products manufactured in China. The current U.S. presidential administration has indicated that it may impose additional tariffs on China and other countries. Additionally, geopolitical disputes (including as a result of China-Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan relations) between the U.S. and China may lead to further restrictions on trade and/or obstacles to conducting business in China. Recently, Australia and China have improved relations and resolved trade disputes. However, as we ship a significant portion of our lithium from Australia into China for further processing, any tensions or a regression in relations between the countries could have a material impact on our operations. Furthermore, the Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality and in response to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Chinese government has also instituted energy intensity and energy consumption targets in a number of provinces in its efforts to reduce energy consumption, resulting in energy quotas and shortages in energy supply that can be disruptive to construction and manufacturing operations. These and other risks may have an adverse effect on our sales to Chinese customers and/or result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some, or all, of our strategic investments in China.\n\nIn December 2021, the United States adopted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”) which creates a rebuttable presumption that any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Administrative Region of China or that are produced by certain entities are prohibited from importation into the United States and are not entitled to entry. These import restrictions came into effect on June 21, 2022. While we are not presently aware of any direct impacts these restrictions will have on its supply chain, the UFLPA may materially and negatively impact our ability to import the goods and products we rely on to manufacture our products and operate our business.\n\nOur inability to secure key raw materials, or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, including due to climate change, could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations.\n\nThe long-term profitability of our operations will, in part, depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources, including energy and raw materials. For example, our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce, or otherwise obtain, lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand. If we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials, we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities, which could adversely impact us. Furthermore, other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold, even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly. Increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil, chlorine and metals (including molybdenum and rare earths, which are used in the refinery catalysts business). We generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to do so (or may be delayed in doing so). In addition, raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes. Our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases, or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility, could adversely affect our margins.\n\nCompetition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\n\nWe compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, climate-related performance and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than us and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in \n\n13\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nconditions within our industry. Competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could negatively affect our margins and profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements, shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors.\n\nIn addition, Albemarle’s brands, product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the Company’s reputation. Accordingly, the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims, whether with or without merit, against our Company or its products, imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us, or are otherwise disparaging of our Company or its products. Further, our own actions could hurt such brands, product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity.\n\nOur research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs, and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products.\n\nOur industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement. Manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products. Our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end markets. As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify, develop, market and, in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for innovative products in a timely manner or at all, as may be required to replace or enhance existing products, and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position.\n\nIn addition, our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications. Changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products. Should a customer decide to use a different material due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. Our business, results of operations, cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products.\n\nDespite our efforts, we may not be successful in developing new products and/or technology, either alone or with third parties, or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. Our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval. Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace. Furthermore, ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues.\n\nThe development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us.\n\nThe development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. Current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input. Alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter, more efficient, faster charging and less expensive, and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds. We cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon. Commercialized battery technologies that use no, or significantly less, lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues.\n\nDevelopment projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. The development of our mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks.\n\nMine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, potential delays, cost overruns, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, breakdowns and injuries to persons and property. The development of our mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, \n\n14\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nunderground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions. While we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our mines to safely manage production, there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project.\n\nOur decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. In addition, the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated mineral resources and reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of lithium and bromine. \n\nNew development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. The actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nDownturns in our customers’ industries, which may be cyclical or affected by changes in governing administrations, could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\n\nDownturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales. Many of our customers are in industries, including the electronics, building and construction, oilfield and automotive industries, that are cyclical in nature, or which are subject to secular market downturns or may face adverse effects of evolving regulatory regimes. Historically, cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. \n\nAdditionally, certain of these industries are subject to regulatory schemes that may shift with changes in the political climate. The results of elections in the United States or other countries in which our customers are located and changes in governing administrations and legislative bodies may result in consequent changes to these regulatory regimes that could cause a decline within these industries, leading to a diminished demand for our products. For example, the new U.S. presidential administration has indicated that it may halt government infrastructure spending to establish charging points for EV users, eliminate certain tax cuts available in connection with EV purchases, and rescind requirements pertaining to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all or any of which measures may have a detrimental affect on the U.S. EV industry. A decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\n\nOur results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our HPC catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals.\n\nOur HPC catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products. The effectiveness of HPC catalysts diminishes with use, requiring the HPC catalysts to be replaced, on average, once every one to four years. The sales of our HPC catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the HPC catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter. In addition, the timing and profitability of HPC catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter. Sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions, which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods. In addition, crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals.\n\nRegulation, or the threat of regulation, of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\n\nWe manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups. For example, there has been scrutiny of certain brominated fire safety solutions by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated fire safety solution products, which are used in a variety of applications to protect people, property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products.\n\nAgencies in the European Union (“E.U.”) continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated fire safety solutions such as tetrabromobisphenol A and decabromodiphenyl ethane, both of which we \n\n15\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nmanufacture. Additional government regulations, including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants, could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated fire safety solutions and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated fire safety solutions on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\n\nOur business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under REACH, which imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process, which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. See “Regulation” in Item 1. Business. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the E.U. require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calls for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications.\n\nOur products enable important performance attributes of our customers’ products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. These risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because, in certain instances, we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees. Also, because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products, we may be requested to participate in, or fund in whole or in part the costs of, a product recall conducted by a customer. For example, some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry. In the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products, we may be asked to participate in, or fund in whole or in part, such a recall.\n\nOur customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us. \n\nA successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers.\n\nOur business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses, any of which could injure our employees or other persons, damage our facilities or other properties, interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\n\nOur business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, as well as natural resource extraction, including explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties.\n\n16\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nOur business could be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\n\nThe nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous U.S. and non-U.S. national, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. We currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities. Some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities, including, for example, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify.\n\nFurther, some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation. These regulations affect the manufacturing processes, handling, uses and applications of our products. In addition, our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations. Ongoing compliance with such laws, regulations and permits is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, registration/approval requirements, transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, and storage and disposal of wastes, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we may be subject to carbon pricing or taxation proposals in some jurisdictions where we operate. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters. Furthermore, environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs.\n\nCertain of our operations could be adversely affected by local communities and/or other stakeholders.\n\nRelationships with local communities and other stakeholders may impact our operations, particularly in Chile and Western Australia. We may become impacted by the interests of local communities and other stakeholders, including in some cases, indigenous peoples. Certain of these communities or other stakeholders may have or may develop interests or objectives which are different from, or even in conflict with, our objectives, including the use of our lands and waterways near our operations. Our relationships with the communities near our sites and other stakeholders are critical to the future success of our sites, as well as at any future development. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. Publicity adverse to our operations, or the mining industry generally, could have an adverse effect on our development plans or future operations and may impact relationships with the communities in which we ultimately operate and other associated stakeholders.\n\nWe may in the future, be subject to disputes with local communities, including indigenous peoples, regarding the use of certain aspects of our assets, facilities and land and may in the future, be required to enter into settlement agreements providing for such use, on terms that include, among others, lump sum payments, royalty payments or restrictions on our business.\n\nIn addition, disputes surrounding indigenous land claims regarding lands on or near our operations could interfere with future operations and/or result in additional operating costs or restrictions, as well as adversely impact the use and enjoyment of our real property rights with respect to our assets.\n\nWhile we are committed to operating in a socially responsible manner, there can be no assurance that our efforts in this respect will mitigate this potential risk. All the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \n\n17\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\ncondition and results of operations, including, but not limited to, as a result of increased costs, reduced revenues, diversion of management attention, reputational harm, disruptions to our operations and other reasons.\n\nWe may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested. \n\nIn connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters, such as certain breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain environmental matters. With respect to environmental matters, the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws. We may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments. Further, we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser. Such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2021, we agreed to pay $665 million to settle claims related to a legacy Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”) business sold to a third party prior to our acquisition of Rockwood in 2015.\n\nAt several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist (including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated), we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators; however, in the event we make a claim, the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding, or not have the financial capacity to fulfill, its indemnity obligation. If our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective, our accrual and/or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws, and in the past have paid fines in order to resolve self-reported potential violations of such laws.\n\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar foreign anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our joint ventures), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn September 2023, following an internal investigation and voluntary self-reporting of potential violations of the FCPA, we finalized agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC relative to improper payments made, prior to 2018, by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business (now Ketjen).  In connection with this resolution, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an administrative resolution with the SEC, pursuant to which we paid a total of $218.5 million in aggregate fines, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest. We also agreed to certain ongoing compliance reporting obligations.\n\nWe are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to government regulation in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs, including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses, or require changes in business practice, in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business. Our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities. Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\n\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights, or being accused of infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nProtection of our proprietary processes, methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U.S. and certain other countries in which our \n\n18\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nproducts are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of some countries, or their enforcement, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. Additionally, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.\n\nWe also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future. We endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us. However, we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all. Our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers, which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers.\n\nWe could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely. Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits. We may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products.\n\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft.\n\nOur inability to acquire or develop additional lithium reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.\n\nOur lithium reserves will, without acquiring or developing additional reserves, decline as we continue to extract these raw materials. Accordingly, our future profitability depends upon our ability to operate in a way that optimizes extraction of raw materials from the reserves we have and acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract. Exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature. Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably. Once a site with potential resources is discovered, it may take several years of development until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions. \n\nWe utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as, but not limited to, changes in volumes, grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed; changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force; the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; adverse geotechnical conditions; availability, supply and cost of water and power; fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development; changes in royalty agreements, laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes; and weather or severe climate impacts.\n\nFor our existing operations, we utilize geological, hydrogeological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or social, political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable \n\n19\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nreserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. In addition, it cannot be assumed that any part or all of the inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. See Item 2. Properties, for a discussion and quantification of our current mineral resources and reserves.\n\nThere is risk to the growth of lithium markets.\n\nOur lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium batteries and the growth in demand for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. As such, our business results inherently depend on decarbonization of the global economy. To the extent that such development, adoption, decarbonization and growth do not occur in the volume and/or manner that we contemplate, including for reasons described under the heading “The development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us,” above, the long-term growth in the markets for lithium products may be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDemand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our revenues and profitability generally.\n\nOur ability to successfully develop our lithium resources and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithium-based end products, such as lithium hydroxide. The market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, primarily world supply and demand. Such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns, various political developments and macro-economic circumstances. \n\nIn addition, the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance. We may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations; although some of our long-term agreements include higher pricing, we are also party to index-referenced and variable-priced contracts. Lithium prices significantly decreased by approximately 85% to 95% from their high in January 2023 and remained at that lower level throughout 2024, which adversely impacted our financial results. High volatility or further declines in the lithium prices could have a material and adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our Energy Storage business and on our company generally. In addition, a further decrease in lithium prices may lead to additional inventory valuation charges in the valuation period prior to when the goods are sold. For example, As a result of the decline in lithium market pricing, the Company recorded charges to reduce the value of certain finished goods and spodumene to their net realizable value, including a charge of $604.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The balance of these adjustments to inventories was $104.0 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nFollowing the Wodgina acquisition in 2019, the Wodgina mine idled production of spodumene until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production in 2022. Additionally, in 2024, the Company announced that it was placing portions of its Kemerton project into care and maintenance and stopping construction on other portions, in an effort to optimize its cost structure in light of the depressed levels of lithium prices. Depending on market conditions and the Company’s cost structure, the Company may take additional actions in the future to idle production or halt construction activities at its mines or processing facilities due to lack of market demand or for other reasons.\n\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team. In light of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the unanticipated departure, death or disability of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In addition, the U.S. and other regions in which we operate are experiencing an acute workforce shortage for skilled workers, which in turn has created a hyper-competitive wage environment that may impact our ability to attract and retain employees.\n\n20\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,300 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures. Approximately 28% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees, a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs.\n\nOur joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures.\n\nWe currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. We apply the equity method of accounting to joint ventures when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operational decision-making authority and financial policies of the investee but we do not exercise control. Our equity method investees are governed by their own board of directors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the investees’' shareholders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the investees’ boards of directors, the interests of the investees’ shareholders may not align with our interests or the interests of our shareholders and strategic and contractual disputes may arise. \n\nWe are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investees to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to our positions, as applicable, on the boards of directors and through certain limited governance or oversight roles, such influence may be limited. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Also, differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\n\nOur required capital expenditures can be complex, may experience delays or other difficulties, and the costs may exceed our estimates.\n\nOur capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment, facilities and properties, and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment, facilities and properties. Execution of these capital expenditures can be complex, and commencement of production requires start-up, commission and certification of product quality by our customers, which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities. Construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such projects and our ability to estimate future demand for our products. In addition, our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations. Budgets for certain projects can include government funding, which help support a portion of the anticipated construction costs. Any change to the government budgetary priorities could adversely affect the funding for these projects or our ability to apply for funding. \n\nFuture capital expenditures may be significantly higher, depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines, and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry. We may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets.\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy, and we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our aggregate long-term debt was $3.5 billion, primarily related to senior notes. We expect to maintain significant levels of indebtedness going forward. Our indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\n21\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, and any failure to comply with the obligations under our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing our senior notes, the 2022 Credit Agreement or agreements governing future indebtedness;\n\n•increasing the risk of a credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\n•reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the economy and our industry;\n\n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\n•making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and\n\n•potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.\n\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on our future performance, which is subject to a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nBecause a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result, our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. In addition, there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us.\n\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants. These covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility. The 2022 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain (i) a certain ratio of consolidated net funded debt (plus a proportionate amount of Windfield’s net funded debt) to Windfield-Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) and (ii) a certain ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges. In the past, we have been able to renegotiate and amend the covenants in 2022 Credit Agreement in order to maintain compliance, but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if needed. The failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including cross-defaults to other debt facilities. See “Financial Condition and Liquidity—Long-Term Debt” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further descriptions of our 2022 Credit Agreement covenants.\n\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing, the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations.\n\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades. During 2024, the Company’s ratings were downgraded by two of the three main credit ratings agencies, resulting in the increase of the applicable margin for borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement to 1.20%. Further watches, reviews or downgrades could occur. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing, including under our 2022 Credit Agreement and our commercial paper program, limits our access to the capital markets and has an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\n\n22\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nBorrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates, and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. The downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings.\n\nWrite-offs or impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets can result in significant charges to earnings.\n\nUnder U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 31 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. During 2024, we made the decision to stop construction of Kemerton conversion plant Trains 3 and 4, and put Kemerton Train 2 into care and maintenance. We determined these actions to be a triggering event for a review of impairment of our Energy Storage reporting unit goodwill and associated long-lived asset groups. Although this review did not result in any impairment to goodwill or long-lived assets, the write-off of the assets with no future economic value resulted in charges of $1.0 billion in 2024. As we continue our review of our cost and operating structure, we may be required to record additional charges in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business could suffer if we are not successful in executing our strategy and initiatives in connection with our comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure.\n\nIn January 2024, we announced that we were undertaking proactive measures to optimize our cost structure in response to changing end-market conditions, particularly in the lithium value chain. These measures have included an ongoing comprehensive review of our cost and operating structure, in connection with which we placed Kemerton Train 2 in care and maintenance and stopped construction on Kemerton Trains 3 and 4, and initiated a global workforce reduction that impacted 6-7% of total headcount. These actions are intended to deliver significant cost savings and enhance our long-term competitiveness. However, there are no assurances that we will achieve these aims to the extent we expect, within the anticipated timeframes or at all. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in net sales or through increases in other expenses. Failure to realize the expected cost savings from our cost optimization efforts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\n\nWe conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Chinese Renminbi, Euro and Australian Dollar. Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. With respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations, for the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 39% of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency-denominated debt outstanding. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency. Our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks.\n\nSignificant or prolonged periods of higher interest rates may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nInterest rates may have a direct impact on our business to the extent we borrow under our unsecured credit facility, utilize our commercial paper program, or incur other forms of variable rate indebtedness or new indebtedness based on current interest rates. Borrowings under our unsecured credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on a benchmark rate depending on the currency in which the loans are denominated, plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 0.910% to 1.375%, depending on the Company’s credit rating. In May 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes from time-to-time in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of up to $1.5 billion (up from $750 million prior to the May 2023 increase). \n\n23\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nIn a rising interest rate environment, debt financing will become more expensive and may have higher transactional and servicing costs. Although we may take steps to limit our exposure to variable rate debt, if interest rates remain relatively high or increase in the future, we could see increases in our borrowing costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nInflationary trends in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials and in transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment.\n\nIf we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset inflationary cost trends, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations, and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect higher input costs is critical to maintain and grow our sales. Increases in prices of our products to customers or the impact of the broader inflationary environment on our customers and may lead to declines in demand and sales volumes. Further, we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, especially if our competitors are able to more successfully adjust to such input cost volatility. Increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or purchase less of our products, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations.\n\nChanges in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results.\n\nOur effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”), enacted August 16, 2022, among other items, imposed a 15% alternative minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion and introduces or extends a number of tax credits to promote clean energy development. We continue to monitor the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act and other regulatory developments on our financial condition, operating results, and income tax rate. Currently, the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the U.S.\n\nWe have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-U.S. subsidiaries, because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense, which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities.\n\nOur future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. Recent developments, including the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities. The OECD developed a global tax framework inclusive of a 15% global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (“Pillar Two”). The E.U.’s Pillar Two Directive was effective as of January 1, 2024 for certain aspects of the directive, with the remaining aspects effective on January 1, 2025. Other major jurisdictions are actively considering and implementing changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. We have assessed this framework and determined, based upon available guidance, that these changes could have a material impact to our results of operations, but it is dependent on our ongoing mix of earnings. Any future changes in OECD guidance or interpretations, including local country tax legislative changes thereof could impact our initial assessment; therefore, we will continue to monitor and refine our assessment as further guidance is made available.\n\nWe are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. It is possible the outcomes from these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n\n24\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position and U.S. deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases) to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.\n\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings, which may be material in the future. The outcome of proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations, leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables. \n\nLegal and regulatory proceedings, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct, may divert management’s attention and other resources, inhibit our ability to sell our products, result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, and otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nAlthough our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business.\n\nWe have several defined benefit pension plans around the world, including in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Belgium and Japan. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries.\n\nIn previous years, we have made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. We anticipate approximately $9 million of required cash contributions during 2025 for our defined benefit pension plans. Additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2025 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns, interest rates, and legislative changes. The amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business.\n\nFurther, an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets, our results of operations, our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity. Our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations. Any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity. We cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations.\n\nWe may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\n\nWe believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, and support new product development. To satisfy these growing customer requirements, our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions. \n\nAs part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future. Our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial \n\n25\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nresources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.\n\nThe process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include:\n\n•potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\n•unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures and litigation arising from acquisitions;\n\n•unforeseen adjustments, charges and write-offs;\n\n•problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities;\n\n•unexpected losses of customers of, or suppliers to, the acquired business;\n\n•difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses’ standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\n•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\n•variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting;\n\n•inability to coordinate new product and process development;\n\n•loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\n•diversion of management’s attention from other business matters; and\n\n•challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.\n\nAny such integration failure could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, from time to time, we may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition, but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration. This could cause significant diversion of management’s attention and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWe may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness related to acquisitions.\n\nWe have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions. A part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth. Our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants. In addition, the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As a result, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions.\n\nAny such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations (whether or not arising from acquisitions) could have important consequences and risks for us, including: \n\n•reducing flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses, the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate, and to technological and other changes; \n\n•lowering credit ratings;\n\n•reducing access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenses and for general corporate purposes;\n\n•to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates;\n\n•reducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and other activities; and\n\n•creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt level.\n\n26\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nAdverse conditions in the economy, and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nA global, regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products, negatively impacting our operating results. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national, regional and global economies, including economic downturns (including credit market tightness, which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners), declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing, leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products, and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion or may seek to renegotiate current arrangements to suit their circumstances. Further, suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Also, it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. Finally, any such adverse conditions in the economy and financial markets could make it difficult for us to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms.\n\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches, information technology system failures, or network disruptions.\n\nWe and our third-party service providers have been and will continue to be subject to advanced and persistent threats in the areas of information and operational technology security and fraud, which may become more sophisticated over time. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, as well as work with third-party service providers on detection of, and alerting us to, any incidents affecting us, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that a cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, customers’ or licensees’ confidential or personal information, we may incur liability as a result. The devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results.\n\nIn addition, risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, or vulnerabilities in our third-party service providers’ systems, could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, we face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Finally, we can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that our third-party service providers have established or use will be effective. \n\nAlthough we have implemented certain processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.\n\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products.\n\nChemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations (and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future) that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities, which increase our overhead expenses.\n\nWe are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the U.S. We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities, like Washington, D.C., could affect the efficiency of our logistical \n\n27\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\noperations. Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture.\n\nThe Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program (“CFATS Program”), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the U.S. DHS has enacted rules under the CFATS Program that impose comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest. These rules establish risk-based performance standards for the security of the U.S.’s chemical facilities. They require covered chemical facilities to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments, which identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement Site Security Plans, which include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. We have implemented all necessary changes to comply with the rules under the CFATS Program to date, however, we cannot determine with certainty any future costs associated with any additional security measures that DHS may require.\n\nThe occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general, and the markets for our products in particular. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive.\n\nNational or international disputes, political instability, terrorism war or armed hostilities, could impact our results of operations.\n\nGeo-political events, national or international disputes, political instability, terrorism or other acts of violence, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct business in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cybersecurity breaches arising from geo-political instability. Any such events may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to capital markets, raw materials, energy and freight costs, our supply chain, information security and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, energy shortages, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. We currently do not sell our products into Russia nor have assets or any operations in the country, however, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict’s current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to its impact in the countries in which we do conduct business.\n\nAt this time, the current situation in the Middle East has resulted in our business operations continuing as normal with some shipping and raw material delays. However, the geo-political climate remains volatile and a disruption could occur at any time, potentially causing a financial impact to our business.\n\nNatural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme heat, storms or earthquakes; pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers, or customers do business could cause interruptions in our operations. Historically, major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast for many of our customers and certain of our suppliers of raw materials, which has had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products. Our operations in Chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes, and our operations in Asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons. A global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region in which we or our key partners, customers, or suppliers operate could disrupt business, depending on factors including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, government restrictions on businesses and individuals, impact on demand for our products, impact on the supply chain network, and the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we do business. If similar or other weather events, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events occur in the future, they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy.\n\n28\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nOur insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures.\n\nWe maintain property, business interruption, casualty, and other insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and coverage limits. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. We are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\n\nWe may be exposed to certain physical, transitional, regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\n\nImpacts of climate change include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures, among others. For example, there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the Dead Sea, from which our joint venture, JBC, produces bromine. Climate changes and unprecedented weather events may pose a risk to business operations in vulnerable areas. In some regions including China, extreme heat and drought conditions could also impact the availability of hydropower resulting in decreased production and/or increased costs. Storms could cause business interruptions, incur additional restoration costs, and impact product availability and pricing. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to climate related impacts or geopolitical events are possible and exist as external risk factors that we can respond to but not control. These events could limit the supply of key raw materials to us, or could have significant impacts to pricing. We work with numerous independent suppliers to mitigate lack of availability from a single supplier, however in some cases products with limited numbers of suppliers may become difficult to obtain.\n\nPotential transition risks related to climate change include increased battery regulation, potential loss of customers due to climate-related performance, and increased costs related to carbon pricing. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Potentially, additional U.S. federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations. In addition, we have operations in the E.U., Brazil, China, Japan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, which have implemented, or may implement, measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Significant regional or national differences in approaches to environmental laws and regulations could affect us disproportionately compared to our competitors and result in a competitive disadvantage to us.\n\nThe outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. We may have heightened credit risk due to our exposure to climate risks. While certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control, compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation, market trends or litigation on the Company is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFailure to meet sustainability expectations or standards or achieve our sustainability goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders, regulators and the public in general on sustainability matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to sustainability, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations, regulatory obligations, economic conditions and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals \n\n29\n\nAlbemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\npresent numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\n\nMeeting the sustainability goals we have set and publicly disclosed will require significant resources and expenditures, and we may face pressure to make commitments, establish additional goals, and take actions to meet them beyond our current plans. If customers and potential customers are dissatisfied with our sustainability goals or our progress towards meeting them, then they may choose not to buy our products and services, which could lead to reduced revenue, and our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we could experience reduced revenue and reputational harm if we are targeted by anti-sustainability groups or influential individuals who disagree with our public positions on social or environmental issues. Additionally, lawsuits or regulatory actions based on allegations that certain public statements regarding sustainability-related matters by companies are false and misleading “greenwashing” campaigns could adversely impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\n\nWe may be unable to satisfactorily meet evolving standards, regulations and disclosure requirements related to sustainability. Such matters can affect the willingness or ability of investors to make an investment in our Company, as well as our ability to meet regulatory requirements, including proposed rules related to greenhouse gas emissions. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations, additional regulations and industry standards or achieve our sustainability goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.",
