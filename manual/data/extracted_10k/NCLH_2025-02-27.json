      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\nHistory and Development of the Company\n\nNorwegian commenced operations from Miami, Florida in 1966, launching the modern cruise industry by offering weekly departures from Miami, Florida to destinations in the Caribbean. In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed. In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO and the ordinary shares of NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC. In November 2014, we completed the acquisition of PCI.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)’s BEPS 2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda.  In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries previously domiciled in the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Panama and the state of Delaware, were redomiciled to Bermuda.\n\nOur Company\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nWe are a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. \n\nOur brands offer itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian’s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry’s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.\n\nAll of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as air transportation and hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 32 ships with approximately 66,500 Berths. The Company expects to add 13 additional ships to our fleet from 2025 through 2036. For the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. For Oceania Cruises, we have one Allura Class Ship on order for delivery in 2025. We also have orders for three new classes of ships: four Oceania Cruises ships with deliveries currently scheduled from 2027 through 2031, two Prestige Class Ships with deliveries currently scheduled in 2026 and 2029 and four Norwegian Cruise Line ships with deliveries currently scheduled from 2030 through 2036. We have the option to cancel the last two ships on order for Oceania Cruises currently scheduled for delivery in 2030 and 2031.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nOur registered offices are located at Walkers Corporate (Bermuda) Limited, Park Place, 55 Par-la-Ville Road, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Our principal executive offices are located at 7665 Corporate Center Drive, Miami, Florida 33126. Daniel S. Farkas, the Company’s Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Development Officer and Secretary, is our agent for service of process at our principal executive offices.\n\n​\n\nOur

corporate strategy is based on four pillars and bolstered by our commitment to sustainability.  \n\nPeople Excellence\n\nWe seek to foster a culture based on innovation, collaboration, transparency and passion while supporting our team members to reach their full potential by developing talent both shoreside and shipside.\n\nGuest Centric Product Offering\n\nWe seek to deliver vacations that our guests value, providing digital and other tools to make it easier for them to curate their experience throughout the customer journey. We are focused on delivering exceptional onboard experiences, focusing on capturing more pre-cruise spend.\n\nLong-term Growth Platform\n\n ​\n\nWe seek to expand only into offerings that matter most to our current and future guests and that deliver meaningful experiences and improve returns. For example, we are building larger, more efficient vessels to drive returns while enhancing the guest experience. Additionally, we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation. \n\n​\n\nExceptional Performance\n\n​\n\nWe are focused on pricing optimization, cost excellence and operating responsibly to generate enhanced returns. We are currently undergoing a broad and ongoing effort to improve operating efficiencies, including cost minimization initiatives, allowing us to progress towards achieving lower leverage. \n\n​\n\nOur Commitment to Sustainability \n\n​\n\nOur global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, is centered around our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment while delivering on our vision to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world.\n\n​\n\nCompetitive Strengths\n\nWe believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy:\n\n​\n\nClearly Defined Brands\n\n​\n\nOur portfolio of three award-winning brands operates a combined 32 ships ranging in size from approximately 500 to over 4,000 Berths.\n\n​\n\n10\n\n\nNorwegian’s ships cater to a variety of travelers with up to 20 dining options; various attractions, including the world’s only racetracks at sea; a wide array of entertainment options; full-service spas at sea; and a diverse range of accommodations, including luxury suites in The Haven, studio staterooms designed and priced for the solo traveler and everything in between. Oceania Cruises’ award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent’s all-inclusive fare includes unlimited shore excursions in every port, a one-night pre-cruise hotel package in Concierge Suites and higher, specialty dining, unlimited premium beverages, including fine wines and spirits, pre-paid gratuities, unlimited Starlink Wi-Fi, valet laundry service and other amenities. Regent also offers an Ultimate All-Inclusive Air option, which includes the previously stated amenities plus flights with the flexibility to choose the desired air class, transfers between airport and ship and a private executive chauffer credit for private transfers. \n\nUpscale Guest Demographic\n\nOur target demographic consists primarily of high-net-worth travelers who appreciate upscale experiences. This customer base has proven to be resilient during economic downturns and demonstrates strong repeat booking patterns.\n\nDiversified Itinerary Mix\n\nWe have a wide variety of itineraries to over 700 ports around the world. Our brands offer diverse itineraries to worldwide destinations including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nStrong Growth Profile\n\n​\n\nWe believe our strategic fleet expansion program, including new ship orders and the modernization of existing vessels, positions us for sustained growth. We maintain a disciplined approach to capacity growth while focusing on yield optimization and cost control. \n\n​\n\nProven Model \n\n​\n\nOur business model has demonstrated resilience through various market cycles. We maintain strong relationships with travel partners, have sophisticated revenue management strategies, and focus on operational excellence to drive shareholder value.\n\n​\n\nReduce leverage and optimize our balance sheet\n\nIn 2024 and 2025, we continued to take actions to improve our capital structure as part of our long-term financial strategy.\n\n●In September 2024, NCLC issued $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% senior unsecured notes due 2030.  The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024, including to pay any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n\n●In January 2025, the full amount of outstanding borrowings under the Breakaway one loan, Breakaway two loan, Marina newbuild loan and Riviera newbuild loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was repaid.\n\n●Also in January 2025, NCLC issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and to pay any related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. \n\n11\n\n\n●Additionally in January 2025, the Revolving Loan Facility was increased from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion with the maturity date extended to 2030, and the collateral of the Revolving Loan Facility and the 8.125% senior secured notes due 2029 were modified. \n\nRefer to Note 9 – “Long-Term Debt” for further details about the above transactions.\n\nDisciplined Fleet Expansion\n\nFor the Norwegian brand, we have four Prima Class Ships on order with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. The third and fourth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 156,000 Gross Tons with 3,550 Berths, and the fifth and sixth Prima Class Ships will be approximately 169,000 Gross Tons with 3,850 Berths. For the Norwegian brand, we also have an order for four additional ships, each at approximately 225,000 Gross Tons and 5,150 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2030 through 2036. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we have an order for one Allura Class Ship to be delivered in 2025, which will be approximately 68,000 Gross Tons and 1,200 Berths. For the Oceania Cruises brand, we also have an order for four additional ships (which includes two ships on order, which are currently scheduled for delivery in 2030 and 2031, that we have the option to cancel), each at approximately 86,000 Gross Tons and 1,450 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates from 2027 through 2031. For the Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand, we have an order for two Prestige Class Ships, each at approximately 77,000 Gross Tons and 850 Berths, with currently scheduled delivery dates in 2026 and 2029. The impacts of initiatives to improve environmental sustainability and modifications the Company plans to make to its newbuilds and/or other macroeconomic conditions and events have resulted in delays in expected ship deliveries. These and other impacts could result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged.\n\nWe believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands, position us for accelerated growth and provide an optimized return on invested capital. For ships on order, excluding the two ships on order for Oceania Cruises that we have the option to cancel and the four additional ships on order for Norwegian Cruise Line with currently scheduled delivery from 2030 to 2036, we have obtained export credit financing which is expected to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship as well as related financing premiums, subject to certain conditions.\n\nOur Commitment to Sustainability \n\n​\n\nThe continued success of our business is linked to our ability to operate and grow sustainably. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. The Sail & Sustain program is centered around five pillars: Reducing Environmental Impact, Sailing Safely, Empowering People, Strengthening Our Communities and Operating with Integrity and Accountability. The Company’s Board of Directors is actively engaged in overseeing the Sail & Sustain program, strategy and its implementation through its Technology, Environmental, Safety & Security Committee. \n\n​\n\nReducing our environmental impact is a key component of the Sail & Sustain program. The backbone of our ships’ environmental programs is our ISO 14001 – certified Environmental Management System. This voluntary standard sets requirements for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system and helps us systematically identify, manage and control activities related to our environmental performance, manage progress toward our environmental goals and comply with applicable regulations. \n\n​\n\nAs part of our environmental commitment, we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050 across our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and value chain (Scope 3). We have set interim targets to guide us on our path to net zero and provide more details about them in our annual Sail & Sustain report (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report).\n\n​\n\nThe three components of our climate action strategy are Efficiency, Innovation and Collaboration. Each ship in our fleet has a Shipboard Energy Efficiency Management Plan with the objective to improve the overall operating efficiency of the ship by implementing methods for energy and fuel savings. We evaluate, monitor, and implement energy-savings \n\n12\n\n\nprojects on our existing ships including but not limited to HVAC system upgrades, LED lighting, hydrodynamic upgrades, and waste heat recovery projects.\n\n​\n\nThe path towards net zero is complex, and this effort will require significant technological advancements including commercially viable and scalable low or zero GHG emission fuels, but we are committed to doing our part to facilitate this transition. For example, we successfully surpassed our 2024 goal of testing the use of biofuel blends on 40% of our fleet by testing biofuel blends on approximately 47% of our fleet. Biofuels can be blended with traditional marine fuels to support a reduction of lifecycle GHG emissions. This blend is often considered a drop-in fuel for existing vessels and engines and the use of biofuels does not require modifications to existing engines. Though biofuels are not expected to be a commercially viable long-term solution, we believe they are viable transition fuels that can support the decarbonization journey as long-term solutions are tested and scaled. We are also investing in shore power technology, which with the appropriate port infrastructure would allow us to connect to onshore electrical power grids to supply much of the power needed while docked. A total of 19 ships in our fleet, or approximately 59%, are currently equipped with shore power technology, and we are targeting approximately 70% of our fleet to be equipped by year-end 2025. To prepare for a long-term transition towards net zero, we have lengthened and reconfigured the designs for the final two Prima Class ships, expected to be delivered in 2027 and 2028, to accommodate the use of green methanol as a future fuel source. While additional modifications will be needed to fully enable the use of green methanol, these modifications represent an important step forward in the pursuit of net zero by 2050.\n\n​\n\nWe also drive social impact through our philanthropy initiatives, partnerships and community engagement programs. As a leading global cruise line, our success is dependent on the wellbeing and vibrancy of the destinations we visit across the globe. We strive to be a great partner to each destination we visit, working together to find sustainable, long-term solutions for the communities, while at the same time allowing our guests to experience all that these incredible destinations have to offer.\n\n​\n\nWe provide regular updates to our stakeholders on our sustainability efforts and promote awareness on important topics through our Sail & Sustain program, our annual Sail & Sustain report and through various communications regarding important sustainability initiatives across distribution channels, including, but not limited to, press releases, social media and our corporate website. We have published disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework as well as the recommendations outlined in the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework to provide additional transparency to our stakeholders. Climate-related risks, greenhouse gas information and details of our climate action strategy are disclosed in our annual Sail & Sustain report and annual submission to CDP (which does not constitute a part of, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report), which can be found on our website. For additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives, please visit our website at https://www.nclhltd.com/sustainability.\n\n​\n\nHighly Experienced Management Team\n\n​\n\nOur senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. See “Information about our Executive Officers” below for more information on our highly experienced management team.\n\n​\n\nPassenger Ticket Revenue\n\n​\n\nWe offer our guests a wide variety of options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and an array of onboard activities and amenities, meals, entertainment and government taxes, fees and port expenses. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions, internet, valet laundry services, pre-cruise hotel packages, as well as pre- or post-cruise land packages at many destinations we sail to around the world. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, voyage length, stateroom category selected, added inclusions and the time of year that the sailing takes place.\n\n​\n\n13\n\n\nOnboard and Other Revenue\n\nAll three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, spa services, communication services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and communication services may be managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a percentage of the gross sales derived from these concessions. Norwegian’s ticket prices typically include meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities and various sports programs. To maximize onboard revenue, all three brands use various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises’ ticket prices include specialty dining, entertainment, Starlink Wi-Fi, laundry, gratuities and certain other amenities. Regent’s ticket prices typically include onboard amenities such as unlimited complimentary shore excursions, beverages including fine wines and liquors, entertainment, specialty dining, Starlink Wi-Fi, valet laundry, gratuities and more. \n\nSeasonality\n\nOur operations are seasonal and results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year. Historically, demand for cruises has been strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months, which has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur primary competition includes operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean as well as other cruise lines such as MSC Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises and Virgin Voyages. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.\n\nShip Operations and Cruise Infrastructure\n\nShip Maintenance and Logistics\n\nSophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical capabilities and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel) or twice in five years (depending on flag state and age of vessel), and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed three years (depending on flag state and age of vessel). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by The Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship’s flag state to Dry-dock once every five years. To the extent practical, each ship’s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability. We typically take this opportunity to upgrade the vessels in all areas of both guest-facing services and innovative compliance technology.\n\nSuppliers\n\nOur largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll and related (including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services), fuel, airfare, food and \n\n14\n\n\nbeverage, advertising and marketing and travel advisor services. Most of the supplies that we require are typically available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, due to the large quantities that we purchase, we typically can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases for ship construction expenditures are generally denominated in euros and other purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.\n\nCrew and Staff\n\nBest-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate, where travelers have discerning tastes and high expectations for quality service. We have dedicated resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives, we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests’ every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew, helping to build customer loyalty.\n\nWe place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests, crew and the communities we visit. We operate all our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (“ISM Code”), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry. Crew members are trained in the Company’s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships to familiarize themselves and become proficient with the safety equipment onboard. We developed Infectious Disease Management Protocols, which were certified and audited to DNV’s Certification in Infection Prevention, to further enhance our outbreak prevention and response to all types of infectious disease including, but not limited to COVID-19, norovirus, acute gastroenteritis, influenza and influenza-like illnesses.\n\n​\n\nOur NCLH Wellness at Sea initiative is designed to create a wellness-conscious work environment on our ships. We are committed to providing crew members with guidelines, resources, and activities for educational purposes and to help them achieve optimal wellness. Topics in this initiative address, among other things, nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress management and alcohol and tobacco awareness.\n\n​\n\nOur captains and chief engineers are experienced seafarers. Our bridge and technical officers regularly undergo rigorous operations training such as leadership, navigation, stability, statutory and environmental regulatory compliance. To support our deck and engine officers while at sea, we have bridge and engine protocols and support documentation in place, dictating specific standard operating procedures. Our bridge teams conduct a voyage planning process prior to sailing, where the upcoming itinerary is reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to departure and in preparation for arrival. In addition, all of our ships employ state-of-the-art navigational equipment and technology to provide our bridge teams with accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.\n\nPrior to every cruise setting sail, we show a safety video, which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions, and familiarize guests with their muster stations and important safety information. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems. We have developed a Safety Management System (“SMS”), which establishes policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high-quality operation of the fleet. Our SMS is approved and audited regularly by our classification society, and it also undergoes regular internal audits as well as periodic inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities. \n\nInsurance\n\nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.\n\n15\n\n\nIn addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:\n\n●Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities;\n\n●War risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days’ notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven-day period, submit new terms; and\n\n●Insurance for our shoreside property, cybersecurity, directors and officers, general liability risks and other insurance coverages.\n\nOur insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.\n\nTrademarks and Trade Names\n\nUnder the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE” and “FEEL FREE,” the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as “THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.” We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.\n\nUnder the Oceania Cruises brand, we own rights in a number of trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “OCEANIA CRUISES” and its logo, “FINEST CUISINE AT SEA,” and “YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY,” as well as in the names of our ships.\n\nUnder the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names “SEVEN SEAS CRUISES,” “AN UNRIVALED EXPERIENCE,” and “THE MOST INCLUSIVE LUXURY EXPERIENCE” as well as the names of our ships (except where trademark applications have been filed and are pending). \n\nWe also claim common law rights in trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships for each of our brands. \n\nThe Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011, granting us the right to use the “Regent” brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent to use the Regent trade name, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions in the agreement.\n\nRegulatory Matters\n\nRegistration of Our Ships\n\nTwenty-one of the ships that we currently operate are registered in The Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Ten of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands. Our ships registered in The Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall Islands requirements and are subject to international laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.\n\n16\n\n\nOur ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.\n\nEconomic Substance Requirements\n\nNCLH and NCLC are exempted companies formed under the laws of Bermuda and some of their subsidiaries have been formed or continued in Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, St. Lucia or The Bahamas. Pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction, entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out “relevant activities” as specified in such laws, are required to demonstrate adequate economic substance in that jurisdiction and meet the economic substance requirements under such laws.  In general terms, such economic substance requirements mean that: (i) the entity must be actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction; (ii) core income-generating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity must be performed in the jurisdiction; (iii) there are adequate suitably qualified employees in the jurisdiction; (iv) the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction; and (v) there is adequate operating expenditure incurred in the jurisdiction. We have evaluated the activities of NCLH, NCLC and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases, those activities are “relevant activities” for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that, consequently, certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions. If such entities cannot demonstrate compliance with these requirements, we may be liable to pay penalties and fines in the applicable jurisdictions and/or may take the decision to re-domicile such entities to different jurisdictions. We took what we believe were the necessary steps to meet Bermuda’s economic substance requirements during 2024.\n\nEnvironmental Protection\n\nOur ships are subject to various international, national, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those that govern air emissions, waste discharge, wastewater management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways, and we must adhere to various water and air quality-related requirements. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes, and currently contains six annexes, four of which are applicable to cruise ships.\n\nWith regard to air quality requirements, MARPOL Annex VI sets a global limit on fuel sulfur content of 0.5%. Various compliance methods, such as the use of alternative fuels or exhaust gas cleaning systems that reduce an equivalent amount of sulfur oxide (“SOx”) emissions, may be utilized. Annex VI also requires stricter limitations on sulfur emissions within designated Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), which include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, North American waters and the U.S. Caribbean Sea. Ships operating in these waters are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. ECAs have also been established to limit emissions of oxides of nitrogen (“NOx”) from newly built ships with keel lay dates after January 1, 2016. Under MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 14, the Mediterranean Sea will become an ECA with new limits on SOx taking effect on May 1, 2025. The NOx emissions limit for the Canadian Arctic ECA will apply to newly built ships that are at the beginning stage of construction on or after January 1, 2025. The NOx emissions limit for the Norwegian Sea ECA will apply to newly built ships for which the building contract was entered into on or after March 1, 2026, or, in the absence of a ship building contract, with keel lay dates on or after September 1, 2026 or delivery dates on or after March 1, 2030. Additional ECAs may also be established in the future.\n\nBallast water discharges are governed by the MARPOL Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into force in 2017 (the “Convention”), and which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships. Ballast water, which is seawater held onboard ships and used for stabilization, may contain a variety of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment and discharge of ballast water to avoid the transfer of marine species to new, different, \n\n17\n\n\nor potentially unsuitable environments. Applicable vessels sailing in specific itineraries have also been upgraded with ballast water treatment systems to further prevent the spread of invasive species.\n\nMARPOL also sets forth requirements for discharges of garbage, oil and sewage from ships, including regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of such discharges, and the provision of port reception facilities for sewage handling. Ships are generally prohibited from discharging sewage into the sea within a specified distance from the nearest land. Governments are required to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing delay to ships. Ships are required to be equipped with either approved sewage treatment plants, disinfecting systems or sewage holding tanks.\n\nAmendments to MARPOL have made the Baltic Sea a MARPOL Annex IV “Special Area” where sewage discharges from passenger ships are prohibited unless they comply with Resolution MEPC 227(64) adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) of the IMO. Stricter discharge restrictions went into effect for new passenger ships in 2019, and for existing passenger ships in 2021.\n\nIn the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations, provide the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Coast Guard with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is in inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally-protected waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) program, authorized by the Clean Water Act, was established to reduce pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the NPDES requirements are set forth in the EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”). The VGP establishes effluent limits for 26 specific discharge streams incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge- and vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. In 2018, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which will eventually replace the VGP, was signed into law, and the EPA published a  final rule in October 2024 establishing national standards of performance under the VIDA that apply to 20 different types of vessel equipment and systems, as well as general discharge standards that apply to all types of vessel incidental discharges within 12 nautical miles of the United States. The VGP will continue to govern until the U.S. Coast Guard publishes implementing regulations for the final VIDA rule, which it must publish by October 2026. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements certain elements of MARPOL in the U.S., provides for potentially severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”).\n\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship.  Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance.\n\nMany coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and, in some cases, the laws have no statutory limits of liability. Among the most stringent requirements are those set by the State of Alaska, which has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.\n\nThe European Union (“E.U.”) has also adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the E.U. has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.\n\nWith regard to air emissions from seagoing ships, the E.U. requires the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in E.U. ports. All non-ECA waters have a 0.5% fuel sulfur limit.\n\n18\n\n\nThe European Commission has also implemented regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from maritime shipping through a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (“MRV”) regulation, which requires ships over 5,000 Gross Tons to monitor and report carbon emissions on all voyages to, from and between E.U. ports as well as ports in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). As of January 1, 2024, the E.U. MRV regulation is requiring carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions to be reported.\n\nAs part of its Fit for 55 package, the E.U. is in the process of adopting several rules aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Two of the mechanisms that are being used to achieve emissions reductions are the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) and the FuelEU Maritime Initiative. We expect to have increased costs associated with the Fit for 55 regulations but are not able to quantify the impact yet as the impact will depend on future market pricing. In addition, strategies to reduce GHG emissions as well as ship deployment modifications could mitigate the impact of these regulations.   \n\n●ETS: The maritime transport sector was approved to be included in the scope of the ETS. Effective January 2024, ships over 5,000 Gross Tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from E.U. or EEA ports are required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage, depending on whether the voyage was between two E.U. or EEA ports or an E.U. or EEA and a non-E.U. or EEA port. The requirements are being phased in from 2024 to 2026. Covered entities are required to procure and surrender allowances equivalent to 40% of their verified carbon emissions from 2024, with the amount increasing to 70% of carbon emissions from 2025 and 100% of GHG emissions from 2026, with allowances to be surrendered by September in the following year. The costs associated with the purchase of allowances are variable and depend on future market movements, and the number of allowances we will be required to purchase will be influenced by our decarbonization efforts; however, the costs are not expected to have a material impact on net income as a portion will be collected from passengers. \n\n​\n\n●FuelEU Maritime Initiative: Adopted in 2023, the FuelEU regulation sets a maximum limit on the annual average GHG intensity of onboard energy usage for ships over 5,000 Gross Tons arriving at, sailing in or departing from ports in the E.U. or EEA, based on 2020 reference levels. The reduction required will become progressively stricter over time starting with a 2% intensity reduction in 2025 to as much as 80% intensity reduction by 2050. Other key components of the regulation include requirements for connecting to onshore power grids in Trans-European Transport Network ports by 2030 as well as targets for the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin. The new rules began to apply on January 1, 2025, and there are financial penalties for non-compliance.\n\nThe IMO implemented a variety of measures to support the targets of the initial 2018 GHG strategy. In 2021, the IMO adopted two new requirements, which went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (the “CII”) and Energy Efficiency Ship Index (the “EEXI”). The CII is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. Ships are given an annual rating from A to E with a C or better required for compliance. For ships that receive a D rating for three consecutive years, or an E rating for one year, a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved. Beginning in 2023, ships are now required to reduce carbon intensity by 5% from a 2019 baseline, with 2% incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030. The enforcement mechanism for CII has not yet been defined, but the IMO plans to address this enforcement gap and make other modifications to the CII in 2025. The EEXI is a one-time design re-certification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power, transport capacity and ship speed. Ongoing compliance with the EEXI is not expected to have a material impact on our operations.\n\nIn 2023, the IMO revised its 2018 GHG strategy with three ambitions: a reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008; an uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuel and/or energy sources to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by 2030; and, GHG emissions from international shipping to reach net zero by or around 2050. The strategy also set out indicative checkpoints, both relative to 2008, including a reduction of the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, and by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040. The IMO also decided to develop a basket of measures to support the revised ambitions consisting of two parts: a technical element which will be a goal-based marine fuel standard regulating the phased reduction of marine fuel GHG intensity, and an economic element which may be \n\n19\n\n\nsome form of a maritime GHG emissions pricing mechanism. The IMO will continue to develop these measures and according to the agreed timeline, the measures are expected to be adopted in late 2025 and enter into force in around mid-2027.\n\nCompliance with such laws and regulations has resulted in increased costs to our Company and is expected to entail significant expenses for a combination of: ship modifications, purchases of emissions allowances, alternative fuels and higher-cost compliant newbuilds. Compliance is also expected to result in changes to our operating procedures, including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations and slowing the speed of our ships, and may render some ships obsolete, which would adversely impact our operations. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, areas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more stringent restrictions of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.\n\nIf we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition. We expect to make material investments in our business to comply with these laws and regulations; however, the total impact cannot be determined as we are evaluating our compliance plans.\n\nWe refer you to “—Our Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths — Our Commitment to Sustainability” for information related to our sustainability strategy.\n\nPermits for Glacier Bay, Alaska\n\nIn connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, we rely on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate our ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. We currently hold a concession permit allowing for 41 calls annually through September 30, 2029. \n\nPassenger and Crew Well-Being\n\nIn the U.S., we must meet the U.S. Public Health Service’s requirements, which include vessel ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the CDC and the FDA. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene, aimed at proactively protecting the health of travelers and preventing illness transmission to U.S. ports.\n\nWe continue to work directly with the CDC Maritime Unit as well as other health regulatory authorities, such as E.U. Healthy Gateways, to adjust our infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19, influenza, and norovirus) response protocols. \n\nSecurity and Safety\n\nThe IMO has adopted safety standards as part of the SOLAS convention, which apply to all our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All our crew undergo regular security and safety training exercises pursuant to international and national maritime regulations.\n\nSOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the ISM Code. All of our ships are certified as to compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.\n\n20\n\n\nThe SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (“ISPS Code”) was adopted by the IMO in December 2002 with the goal of strengthening maritime security by placing new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping companies.\n\n​\n\nAmendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO also adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification and Tracking. All our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying date.\n\nIn addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) which implements a number of security measures at ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. while docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S., provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a U.S. requirement for accessibility into and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.\n\nMaritime-Labor\n\nIn 2006, the International Labor Organization (“ILO”), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements, such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers, as amended (“STCW”), establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watch-keeping for our seafarers.\n\nFinancial Requirements\n\nThe Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands is required to maintain a $32.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. \n\nIn addition, our brands have a legal requirement to maintain security guarantees based on cruise business originated from the U.K., and certain jurisdictions require us to establish financial responsibility to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, we have in place approximately £65.1 million of security guarantees for our brands as well as a consumer protection policy covering up to £141.1 million. The Company has provided approximately $1.4 million in cash to secure all the financial security guarantees required.\n\nCompliance with these regulations has had an impact on our financial condition. From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general. We cannot estimate the expenses we may incur to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, or the other potential effects these laws may have on our business.\n\nFor information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, see “Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the risk factor titled “We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety, labor, data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations, which \n\n21\n\n\ncould adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs and/or decreased revenue.”\n\nTaxation\n\nU.S. Income Taxation\n\nThe following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.\n\nExemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code\n\nUnder Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”) and the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from the international operation of ships (“shipping income”) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are “primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets” in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the “publicly-traded test”); or (3) it is a “controlled foreign corporation” (a “CFC”) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the “CFC test”). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations require a foreign corporation and certain of its direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements.\n\nNCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, which is a qualified foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly-traded test because its ordinary shares were primarily and regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).  The NYSE is considered to be an established securities market in the United States. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.\n\nWe believe and have taken the position that substantially all of NCLH’s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS’ interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883. There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this matter.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or holdings of NCLH’s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH’s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter, NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly-traded test by prohibiting any person from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH’s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH’s Board of Directors (the “4.9% limit”). Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.\n\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH’s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above.\n\n22\n\n\nTaxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 of the Code is Inapplicable\n\nUnless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its “shipping income” that is derived from sources within the United States. If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.\n\nGenerally, “shipping income” is any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or bareboat charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States, which we refer to as “U.S.-source shipping income,” will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the United States.\n\nIf we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 21% rate) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax and branch-level interest tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the “Net Tax Regime”). Our U.S.-source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of U.S.-source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S.-source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.\n\nIf we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our gross U.S.-source shipping income (the “4% Tax Regime”).\n\nOther United States Taxation\n\nU.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.\n\nIncome from U.S.-flagged Operations\n\nIncome derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. In addition, any dividends paid by our U.S.-flagged operations to NCLC would be considered subject to a dividend withholding tax of 30%. \n\nBermuda Income Taxation\n\nPreviously, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation was enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax, including tax on profits or income among others, such tax would not be applicable to them until March 31, 2035.  Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.  \n\nOn December 27, 2023, the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“the Bermuda Act”) was enacted in Bermuda.  Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has released limited guidance \n\n23\n\n\nwith respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2025 calendar year and beyond. \n\nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Protection Act 1966. Therefore, NCLH, NCLC and their Bermuda subsidiaries became subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax effective as of January 1, 2025.\n\nThe Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion. In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. NCLH believes it met the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any tax loss deductions available on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes the 2020 through 2024 calendar years for Norwegian. These tax loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. Refer to Note 12 – “Income Taxes” for more information.\n\nU.K. Income Taxation\n\nSome of our subsidiaries which are incorporated in the U.K. are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.\n\nCertain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters\n\nWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.\n\nChanges in Tax Laws\n\nThe various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law. For example, the OECD and numerous jurisdictions have had an increased focus on issues concerning the taxation of multinational businesses and have adopted several related reforms including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational businesses that was effective January 1, 2024 or later, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these developments in global tax reform, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company realigned its organizational structure in Bermuda due to the inclusion of the international shipping income exclusion in the Bermuda Act, which we believe provides an ability for the Company to exempt a significant amount of its income from Bermuda income tax. We expect global tax reform will continue to evolve over the coming years, and we will continue to monitor any new developments and assess impacts to the Company.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nOur people are the driving force of our past, current and future success. We aim to empower our team members worldwide, providing them opportunities to grow and develop, and comprehensive benefits that support them to thrive both physically and mentally. We believe this commitment to empower people allows us to attract and retain top talent, while simultaneously providing robust career development opportunities that ultimately result in significant value to our Company. \n\n24\n\n\nIn 2024, the Company announced our Charting the Course strategy, setting People Excellence as the first strategic pillar furthering our commitment to fostering a culture based on our value anchors of Collaboration, Innovation, Transparency and Passion while supporting our team members to reach their full potential. We believe this commitment ultimately results in significant value to our Company and its shareholders. \n\nTeam Members\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 5,200 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 36,500 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises’ ships use a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant staffing onboard. We refer you to “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Our failure or inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nCritical to our success is identifying, recruiting and retaining top talent and incentivizing existing and future team members.  We attract and retain talented team members by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy for our shoreside team is based on rewarding each team member’s individual contributions. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay components including base salary, bonus, equity, commissions and merit increases. We maintain a long-term incentive plan for our manager-level team members and above that allows us to provide share-based compensation to enhance our pay-for-performance culture and to support our attraction, retention and motivational goals. We have established an $18 per hour minimum wage for our non-commission U.S.-based shoreside employees. We also issued an appreciation bonus of up to 10 days of pay to non-management employees not eligible under other bonus or incentive programs. The Company also consistently reviews salary levels in order to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining talent for shoreside and shipboard employees. We believe our compensation programs for our shipboard team are competitive and for the majority of this team, negotiated with various unions and documented in collective bargaining agreements. \n\nThe success of our Company is connected to the well-being of our team members, such that we offer a competitive benefits package including physical, financial and emotional well-being benefits. We offer our full-time U.S. shoreside team members a choice of Company-subsidized medical and dental programs to meet their needs and those of their families.  In addition, we offer health savings and flexible spending accounts, vision cover, paid time off, employee assistance programs, short term disability and voluntary long-term disability insurance, term life and business travel insurance.  We offer a 401(k) retirement savings plan and education assistance benefits. In 2024, following feedback from employees, we announced the increase of our 401(k) company match cap for 2025. Our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace. As we strive to be an employer of choice, the Company continues with a 4/1 flexible work model for shoreside team members globally. The flexible model allows most employees to work in-office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday.\n\nWe proudly offer Family Care Benefits to our eligible shoreside employees that includes paid leave at 100% of an employee’s salary for maternity, paternity, and adoption leaves. Family planning assistance for fertility/surrogacy services and adoption support are also offered. In 2024, As a result of productive focus groups and listening sessions that took place with workplace parents, enhancements to NCLH’s Family Care Benefits, particularly the maternity program, were reviewed and approved for implementation in 2024. A maternity return to work transition program was established to provide a smooth transition to the office following the medical leave. We also introduced a new free women’s menopause support benefit to our team members. In 2024, we opened a new onsite clinic at our corporate headquarters to make healthcare more accessible and convenient for our team members, offering a range of services from physical exams, immunizations, basic diagnostic testing, and low-cost prescription medication. \n\nThe Company continues to offer a robust team member Norwegian cruise benefit to our full time shoreside team members which offers 95% off one cruise per year, along with substantial discounts for additional cruises. Our cruise benefit programs were further enhanced for team member’s friends and family across our brands. \n\n25\n\n\nWe continue to offer the NCLH Wellness at Sea program to all shipboard team members, creating a wellness-conscious work environment on the vessels. We are committed to providing crew members with guidelines, resources, and activities for educational purposes and to guide them to achieve optimal wellness. Topics in this initiative address, for example, nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress management and alcohol and tobacco awareness.\n\nTraining and Development\n\nThe opportunity to grow and develop skills and experience, regardless of job role, division or geographic location is critical to the success of the Company as a global organization. We actively foster a culture of learning and offer a variety of developmental courses for our team members. We provide a mentorship program where even our most senior leaders actively participate.  Succession planning is part of our culture.  We have a year-round focus on providing team members with opportunities to develop their leadership skills and add to our bench of talent through various training initiatives. Succession planning and talent review programs allow us to continuously calibrate and evaluate high potential talent, offering talent rotations and investing in development for long-term success.\n\nEstablished in 2021, Rising Stars remains a key development program to identify high potential shoreside leaders at the Director and Senior Director level.  The 6-month program is conducted with a human resources strategy firm and is focused on developing a growth mindset to refine leadership strengths, champion change and encourage innovation through assessment tools, one-on-one coaching and group learning. We have had successful rates of promotion and retention of Rising Stars graduates. \n\nIn 2024, we enhanced our learning and development program, by offering all shoreside team members access to premiere online learning for a wide range of personal development courses at their own pace. We also launched our new NCLH Executive Academy for our shoreside officers, supporting our Charting the Course strategy and development of key leadership attributes identified in our talent review process. The cohort learning program is delivered in six modules by experienced university faculty. \n\nShipboard team members have the opportunity to learn the skills and responsibilities of another position in a different department, either to increase their effectiveness in the Company, or to give them the opportunity to shift their career path.\n\nRetention and Engagement\n\nWe have a history of strong retention rates across our shoreside and shipboard teams which we attribute to our culture that allows our team members to thrive and achieve their career goals. For the full year of 2024, the Company experienced its highest shoreside voluntary retention rate as compared to the prior four years.\n\nExceptional team members continue to be recognized by a robust annual Award of Excellence recognition program which acknowledges and rewards individual team members and teams for their demonstration of Company values.  In 2024, the Award of Excellence winners were celebrated by the NCLH President & CEO and senior leadership team onboard Regent Seven Seas Mariner. We have also continued the Kloster Visionary Award which honors the Company’s founder, Knut Kloster, by recognizing a shipboard or shoreside team member whose spirit of innovation follows in the footsteps of this visionary. In 2024, we also recognized the first Kloster Visionary Team, which recognizes exceptional innovative teamwork. Through the shipboard Vacation Hero Awards program, shipboard supervisors and management recognize select shipboard team members that have proven to be outstanding in selected categories. This award program is designed to provide recognition and promote total guest satisfaction by encouraging and rewarding team members for demonstrating excellence in service, teamwork, attitude, and leadership.\n\nPorts and Facilities\n\nWe own a private island in The Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We also own and operate a cruise destination in Belize, Harvest Caye, which we introduced in November 2016. We have developed, in conjunction with Port Miami, a new terminal, which is our primary facility at the port. In addition, we have entered into various agreements relating to port or berthing rights for our ships, which include the following:\n\n26\n\n\n●an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby we are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2037 from east coast ports in the United States of America.\n\n●contracts with the Port of New Orleans, Port Canaveral, New York City Economic Development Corporation (Manhattan Cruise Terminal), A.J.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of the risks discussed or additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The ordering of the risk factors below is not intended to reflect an indication of priority or likelihood. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in this Annual Report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward–Looking Statements.”\n​\nDebt/Liquidity Related Risk Factors\n​\nIf our results of operations and financial performance do not recover as planned, we may not be in compliance with maintenance covenants in certain of our debt facilities.\n​\nCertain of our debt facilities include maintenance and financial covenants. For example, under the Seventh ARCA, we are required to maintain a loan to value ratio of less than 0.70 to 1.00. Financial covenants include free liquidity of no less than $250,000,000 at all times, an EBITDA to consolidated debt service ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter unless free liquidity is greater than or equal to $300,000,000 at that time and a total net funded debt to total capitalization ratio. If we expect to not be in compliance, we would expect to seek waivers from the lenders under these facilities or renegotiate these facilities prior to any covenant violation.\n​\nAny covenant waiver or renegotiation of any of our debt facilities has led, and may in the future lead, to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under these debt facilities, and such increased costs, restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities. Our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities will be limited by the restrictions in our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers or renegotiate these facilities in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities, we would be in default of such agreements, which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements. As a consequence, we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities, and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities. If we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of these debt facilities or renegotiate these facilities, there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities.\n​\nWith respect to each of these debt facilities, if we were unable to or did not obtain a waiver, renegotiate or refinance or repay such debt facilities, it would lead to an event of default under such facilities, which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities. In turn, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which includes a significant portion of our assets including our ships. Any such action would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the failure to obtain the covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations.\n​\nWe anticipate that we will need additional financing in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\n​\nWe anticipate that we will need additional equity and/or debt financing in the future to refinance our existing debt and to fund our newbuild program. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, depending on market and other conditions. The ability to raise additional financing depends on numerous factors that are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, the health of financial institutions, our credit ratings and investors’ and lenders’ assessments of our prospects and the prospects of the cruise industry in general.\n​\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants, which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements, and we may be required to further encumber our assets. We may not have sufficient available collateral to pledge to support additional financing. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures, which could negatively affect our business. Our credit ratings, which have been downgraded in the past, could be downgraded again in the future, which could have an impact on the availability and/or cost of financing. In addition, we may conclude that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern, which could have additional effects on our credit ratings and the availability and/or cost of financing. There can be no assurance that our ability to access the credit and/or capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy. If we are not able to fulfill our liquidity needs through operating cash flows and/or borrowings under credit facilities or otherwise in the capital markets, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected and it may be necessary for us to reorganize our company in its entirety, including through bankruptcy proceedings, and our shareholders may lose their investment in our ordinary shares.\n​\nIf we raise additional funds through equity and/or debt issuances, NCLH’s shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of NCLH’s ordinary shares. Further, the exchange of some or all of our outstanding exchangeable notes may dilute the ownership interests of NCLH’s shareholders. Upon exchange of any of the exchangeable notes, any sales in the public market of NCLH’s ordinary shares issuable upon such exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of NCLH’s ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the exchangeable notes may encourage short selling by market participants that engage in hedging or arbitrage activity, and anticipated exchange of any of the exchangeable notes into NCLH ordinary shares could depress the price of NCLH’s ordinary shares.\n​\nOur indebtedness, and the agreements governing our indebtedness, may limit our flexibility in operating our business and a substantial majority of our assets are collateral under our debt agreements.\n​\nA substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, which may limit our available funds for other business functions and strategic opportunities and may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy and the industry in which we operate. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including refinancing our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\n​\nIn addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preference shares; pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments, including the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay dividends or make distributions to NCLH; repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make certain investments or acquisitions; transfer, sell or create liens on certain assets; and consolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to other companies. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\n​\nThe impact of volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees.\n​\nEconomic downturns, including failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crisis, can disrupt the capital and credit markets. Such disruptions could cause counterparties under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees to be unable to perform their obligations or to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them, which could include failures of financial institutions to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements and to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts and other agreements. Also, we may be limited in obtaining funds to pay amounts due to our counterparties \n\n\n31\n\n\n\nunder our derivative contracts and to pay amounts that may become due under other agreements. If we were to elect to replace any counterparty for their failure to perform their obligations under such instruments, we would likely incur significant costs to replace the counterparty. Any failure to replace any counterparties under these circumstances may result in additional costs to us or an ineffective instrument.\n​\nAny potential impairment of our trade names or goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n​\nWe evaluate trade names and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Several factors including a challenging operating environment impacts affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. Reductions of the cash flows used in the impairment analyses may result in the recording of an impairment charge to a reporting unit’s trade name or goodwill. For example, we recognized significant impairment losses during 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments. However, a change in our estimated future operating cash flows may result in a decline in fair value in future periods, which may result in a need to recognize additional impairment charges.\n​\nOperational Related Risk Factors\n​\nUnavailability of ports of call may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nWe believe that attractive port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, health, safety, and environmental concerns, existing capacity constraints, security, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, typhoons and earthquakes, financial limitations on port development, political instability, armed conflicts, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, governmental regulations, including sanctions, and fees, local community concerns about port development and tourism. For example, currently and in the past, regulatory changes, disease outbreaks resulting in a global pandemic, armed conflicts and damages to ports from hurricanes have prohibited our cruise voyages from visiting certain regions. Certain ports have also significantly increased fees related to cruise visits, affecting the profitability of visiting those destinations. There can be no assurance that our ports of call will not be similarly affected in the future. Due to environmental and over-crowding concerns, some local governments have begun to take measures to limit the number of cruise ships and passengers allowed at certain destinations. Limitations on the availability of ports of call or on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports have adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations in the past and could do so in the future.\n​\nWe rely on scheduled commercial airline services for passenger and crew connections. Increases in the price of, or major changes, significant delays and disruptions, or reduction in, commercial airline services has, and could in the future, disrupt our operations.\n​\nA number of our passengers and crew depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to ports of embarkation for our cruises. Increases in the price of airfare due to increases in fuel prices, fuel surcharges, changes in commercial airline services as a result of health and safety events, strikes or other staffing shortages, weather or other events, or the lack of availability due to schedule changes or a high level of airline bookings has and could adversely affect our ability to transport guests and crew to or from our ships and thereby increase our cruise operating expenses which, in turn, has an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, many commercial airlines reduced services, experienced staffing shortages and suffered other disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions. COVID-19-related regulations also prevented us from using commercial airline services to transport our crew members to and from our ships, which resulted in increased costs to our Company.\n​\nGlobal events and conditions, including terrorist acts, armed conflicts, acts of piracy, and other international events impacting the security of travel or the global economy, or threats thereof, could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n32\n\n\n\nGlobal events and conditions, including the threat or possibility of future terrorist acts, outbreaks of hostilities or armed conflict, political unrest and instability, the issuance of government travel advisories or elevated threat warnings, increases in the activity of pirates, and other geo-political uncertainties, or the possibility or fear of such events, have had in the past and may again in the future have an adverse impact on our business. Any of these events or conditions may adversely affect demand for, and by extension pricing of, our cruises. Such events or conditions may also have downstream effects on the global economic environment, including increased fuel and commodity pricing, supply chain shortages, labor shortages, volatility in the global capital markets, contraction of the global economy leading to decreased consumer discretionary spending, and other effects impossible to predict at this time.\n​\nArmed conflicts have also impacted, and could in the future impact, our profitability and product offering by limiting the destinations to which we can travel and our operations by making it more difficult to source crew members, guests and third-party vendors from affected regions and making it more difficult or costly to source goods we need to run our operations or to build or maintain our ships. Further, armed conflicts have contributed to extreme volatility in the global financial markets and have had, and may continue to have, further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets and heightened volatility of commodity fuel prices. Such volatility or disruptions have had, and may continue to have, adverse consequences to our business, our suppliers and our customers. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or commodity fuel prices resulting from armed conflicts and other geopolitical tensions.\n​\nPublic health crises have had, and may in the future have, a significant impact on our financial condition, results, operations, outlook, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, demand for voyages and share price.\n​\nPublic health crises have, in the past, and could in the future, have significant negative impacts on all aspects of our business. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to heightened governmental regulations, travel advisories, travel bans and restrictions that have and could significantly impact our global guest sourcing and our access to various ports of call around the globe. We have had instances of disease outbreaks on our ships and there is no guarantee that the health and safety protocols we implement will be successful in preventing the spread of infectious disease onboard our ships and among our passengers and crew. We have been and may in the future be the subject of lawsuits and investigations stemming from outbreaks of infectious disease. We cannot predict the number or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. \n​\nEpidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks or other wide-ranging public health crises in the future would likely also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, In March 2020, we implemented a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages across our three brands due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We began resuming cruise voyages in July 2021 in a phased manner and completed the phased relaunch of our entire fleet in early May 2022. This caused significant costs and lost revenue as a result of, among other things, the suspension of cruise voyages, implementation of additional health and safety measures, reduced demand for cruise vacations, guest compensation, itinerary modifications, redeployments and cancellations, travel restrictions and advisories, the unavailability of ports and/or destinations and protected commissions. We were also negatively impacted by adverse impacts to our travel agencies and suppliers due to COVID-19, and we may experience similar impacts in the event of a future pandemic or other public health crises.\n​\nAdverse incidents involving cruise ships may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThe operation of cruise ships carries an inherent risk of loss caused by adverse weather conditions and maritime disasters, including, but not limited to, oil spills and other environmental mishaps, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods and typhoons, fire, mechanical failure, collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy, political action, civil unrest and insurrection in various countries and other circumstances or events. Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased costs and the frequency and severity of natural disasters may increase due to climate change. The operation of cruise ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including \n\n\n33\n\n\n\nmissing guests, inappropriate crew or passenger behavior and onboard crimes, which may bring into question passenger safety, may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us. We have experienced accidents and other incidents involving our cruise ships in the past and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future. It is possible that we could be forced to cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these factors or incur increased port-related and other costs resulting from such adverse events. Any such event involving our cruise ships or other passenger cruise ships may adversely affect guests’ perceptions of safety or result in increased governmental or other regulatory oversight. An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any of the ongoing claims against us may also lead to negative publicity about us. The expanded use of social media has increased the speed that negative publicity spreads and makes it more difficult to mitigate reputational damage. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified), could have an adverse impact on demand, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is a significant accident, mechanical failure or similar problem involving a ship, we may have to place a ship in an extended Dry-dock period for repairs. This could result in material lost revenue and/or increased expenditures.\n​\nOur business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand to attract new customers and maintain ongoing demand for our offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our results of operations.\n​\nOur name and brand image are integral to the growth of our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our ability to execute our marketing and growth strategy depends on many factors, including the perceived quality of our services, the impact of our communication activities, including advertising, social media, and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand are important to expanding our customer base and will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer experiences.\n​\nWe have used, and expect to continue to use, corporate partnerships, brand ambassadors, traditional, digital, and social media to promote our business. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Ineffective marketing, ongoing and sustained promotional activities, negative publicity, unfair labor practices, and failure to protect the intellectual property rights in our brand are some of the potential threats to the strength of our brand, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish customer confidence in us. Furthermore, actions taken by individuals that we partner with, such as brand ambassadors, influencers or our associates, that fail to represent our brand in a manner consistent with our brand image, whether through our social media platforms or their own, could also harm our brand reputation and materially impact our business. Future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business could be harmed.\n​\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\n​\nOur business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems and technology. These systems and technologies must be refined, updated and replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis in order for us to meet our customers’ demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters, or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology, such as fuel abatement technologies, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.\n​\nThe adverse impact of general economic and related factors, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, inflation, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets and perceptions of these conditions can decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence. The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions.\n​\nThe demand for cruises is affected by international, national, local and other macroeconomic conditions. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate in North America or globally, such as the volatility of fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and/or volatility, more restrictive credit markets, higher \n\n\n34\n\n\n\nunemployment or underemployment rates, inflation, higher taxes, changes in governmental policies and political developments impacting international trade, trade disputes, increased tariffs or customers’ willingness to travel with us, could reduce the level of discretionary income or consumer confidence in the countries from which we source our guests. Consequently, this may negatively affect demand for cruise vacations in these countries, which are a discretionary purchase. Decreases in demand for cruise vacations could result in price discounting or lower Occupancy Percentages, which, in turn, could reduce the profitability of our business. In addition, these conditions could also impact our suppliers, which could result in disruptions in our suppliers’ services and financial losses for us.\n​\nBreaches in data security or other disturbances to our information systems and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection could impair our operations, subject us to significant fines, penalties and damages, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThe integrity and reliability of our information systems and networks are crucial to our business operations and a breach, compromise, damage or other disruption to these systems or networks could impair our operations, have an adverse impact on our financial results and negatively affect our reputation and customer demand. In addition, certain networks are dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Among other things, actual or threatened natural disasters, information systems failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks and other cybersecurity incidents may cause disruptions to our information systems, telecommunications and other networks. Our business continuity, disaster recovery, data restoration plans and data and information system security may not prevent disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and financial results. We carry limited business interruption insurance for certain shoreside operations, subject to limitations, exclusions and deductibles.\n​\nAs part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party service providers collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information. The security of the systems and networks where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business. We experience cybersecurity threats and incidents of varying degrees on our systems and networks and, as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained in the past, and may in the future obtain, access to our computer systems and networks, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks. Cybersecurity threats can include computer viruses, malware, worms, hackers and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including physical and electronic break-ins, router disruption, sabotage or espionage, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering (including through social engineering such as phishing attacks), impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denial-of-service attacks. There can be no assurance that a breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. In addition, we may not be in a position to promptly address security breaches, unauthorized access or other cybersecurity incidents or to implement adequate preventative measures if we are unable to immediately detect such incidents. Our failure to successfully prevent, mitigate or timely respond to such incidents could impair our ability to conduct business and damage our reputation.\n​\nWe are also subject to laws in multiple jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data. Noncompliance with these laws or the compromise of information systems used by us or our service providers resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to the personally identifiable information of our guests, prospective guests, employees or vendors could result in governmental investigation, civil liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, any or all of which could disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. The regulatory framework for data privacy and protection is uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another.\n​\nIn the event of a data security breach of our systems and/or third-party systems or a cybersecurity incident, we may incur costs associated with the following: response, notification, forensics, regulatory investigations, public relations, consultants, credit identity monitoring, credit freezes, fraud alert, credit identity restoration, credit card cancellation, \n\n\n35\n\n\n\ncredit card reissuance or replacement, data restoration, regulatory fines and penalties, vendor fines and penalties, legal fees, damages and settlements. In addition, a data security breach or cybersecurity incident may cause business interruption, information system disruption, disruptions as a result of regulatory investigation or litigation, digital asset loss related to corrupted or destroyed data, loss of company assets, damage to our reputation, damages to intangible property and other intangible damages, such as loss of consumer confidence, all of which could impair our operations and have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n​\nChanges in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs would impact the cost of our cruise ship operations and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increased costs related to fuel prices.\n​\nFuel expense is a significant cost for our Company. We have implemented a strategy to contract with fuel providers at most ports, with a market-driven pricing structure to support our itineraries. Increases in fuel costs are predicted for the upcoming years as new regulatory requirements become effective, causing demand for alternative fuels to grow at a faster pace than the supply infrastructure development. We are actively exploring alternative fuel solutions as regulatory requirements develop to facilitate compliance while working on fuel cost increase protection tools for additional spend mitigation, but we may not be successful in these efforts.\n​\nWe are also required to use alternate fuel sources as regulations aimed at reducing carbon intensity have been introduced and we may choose to use alternative fuels in order to achieve any emissions reduction targets we have and may in the future adopt. For example, the IMO adopted two requirements that went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator and Energy Efficiency Ship Index, which each regulate carbon emissions for ships. The E.U. has included the maritime shipping sector in the scope of its Emissions Trading System, which regulates GHG emissions through a “cap and trade” principle, since January 2024. In addition, as of January 1, 2025, the FuelEU Maritime regulation is designed to promote the use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and clean energy technologies for ships, and mandates ships calling at E.U. ports gradually reduce the GHG intensity of their fuel usage. Under the FuelEU Maritime regulation, ships that have a higher GHG intensity than the requirement must pay a penalty. The penalty is progressively increased if the ship has a compliance deficit for two or more consecutive reporting periods. We could also experience increases in other cruise operating costs due to market forces and economic or political instability resulting from increases or volatility in fuel expense. Our hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions, including choice of hedging instruments, breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that we use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit our ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. Additionally, deterioration in our financial condition could negatively affect our ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.\n​\nMechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nThe new construction, refurbishment, repair and maintenance of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated equipment construction, refurbishment and repair projects. Our ships are subject to the risk of mechanical failure or accident, which we have occasionally experienced and have had to repair. For example, in the past we have had to delay or cancel cruises due to mechanical issues on our ships. There can be no assurance that we will not experience similar events in the future. If there is a mechanical failure or accident in the future, we may be unable to procure spare parts when needed or make repairs without incurring material expense or suspension of service, especially if a problem affects certain specialized maritime equipment, such as the radar, a pod propulsion unit, the electrical/power management system, the steering gear or the gyro system. Limited capacity and availability of shipyards and related subcontractors, including a lack of viable Dry-dock facilities in the Western Hemisphere, could impact our ability to construct or repair ships as needed. Delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and/or necessitate unscheduled Dry-docks and repairs of ships.\n​\nIn addition, availability, work stoppages, insolvency or financial problems in the shipyards’ construction, refurbishment or repair of our ships, other “force majeure” events that are beyond our control and the control of shipyards or subcontractors, or changes to technical specifications due to regulatory changes, sustainability initiatives or other \n\n\n36\n\n\n\nstrategic initiatives could also delay or prevent the newbuild delivery, refurbishment and repair and maintenance of our ships. Any termination or breach of contract following such an event may result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us, potential claims and impairment of losses. A significant delay in the delivery of a new ship, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a new ship could also have an adverse effect on our business. The impacts of global events including armed or geopolitical conflicts and pandemics, a lack of viable Dry-dock facilities, modifications the Company plans to make to its newbuilds, including initiatives to improve environmental sustainability, and other macroeconomic events have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries, and may result in additional delays in ship deliveries in the future, which may be prolonged. The consolidation of the control of certain European cruise shipyards could result in higher prices for the construction of new ships and refurbishments and could limit the availability of qualified shipyards to construct new ships. Also, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis. Any occurrence that prevented such third party from continuing to oversee such projects or substantially increased the costs related to such oversight could have an adverse effect on our operations. These potential events and the associated losses, to the extent that they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nConducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.\n​\nWe operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including political risks, risks of increases in duties, taxes and tariffs, risks relating to anti-bribery laws, as well as risks that laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies may change. Additional risks include imposition of trade barriers, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nOperating internationally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and policies and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or agents may engage in conduct prohibited by our policies, but for which we nevertheless may be held responsible. If our employees or agents violate our policies, if we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions or if we fail to implement or maintain other adequate safeguards, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.\n​\nOur failure or inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nWe must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. We need to hire and train a considerable number of qualified crew members to staff the ships that will be joining our fleet in the coming years. This may require significant efforts on the part of our management team, and our failure or inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified crew members would adversely affect our business. Currently, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain crew members. Any future amendments to such collective bargaining agreements or inability to satisfactorily renegotiate such agreements may increase our labor costs and have a negative impact on our financial condition. In addition, although our collective bargaining agreements have a no-strike provision, they may not prevent a disruption in work on our ships in the future. Any such disruptions in work could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.\nNegative perceptions about the cruise industry, carbon intensity, sustainability or otherwise may make it increasingly difficult to retain and hire additional crew members to staff our fleet and to recruit new employees generally. \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n​\nImpacts related to climate change may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThere has been an increased focus on GHG and other emissions from global regulators, consumers and other stakeholders. Regulations addressing climate change that have already been adopted or are being considered, as described under “Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate,” may have significant adverse impacts to our profitability and operations. In addition, concern about climate change may cause consumers to avoid certain kinds of travel including cruise and air travel, which could impact our ability to source guests. Increasing concerns about GHG emissions may attract scrutiny from investors and may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to raise capital. Our ships, port facilities, corporate offices and island destinations have in the past and may again be adversely affected by an increase in the frequency and intensity of adverse weather conditions caused by climate change. For example, certain ports have become temporarily unavailable to us due to hurricane damage and other destinations have either considered or implemented restrictions on cruise operations due to environmental concerns. We expect to make significant investments in technology, equipment and alternative fuels in order to achieve any climate-related targets we may set and to comply with climate-related regulations, and our profitability and operations may be adversely impacted by such investments. These investments may have costs beyond our expectations and may not ultimately benefit us as expected. The actions we take to meet our emissions reduction goals and requirements have in the past and may again result in delays to our shipbuilding program. Our ability to achieve our sustainability commitments and goals will depend on a number of variable factors, some of which are outside of our control. We may fall short of any sustainability goals we set, including those disclosed in this report, which may result in negative impacts to our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, backlash against our sustainability initiatives and commitments may harm our reputation among other stakeholders and expose us to related liabilities.\n​\nOur inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nThere can be no assurance that our risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid by our insurance. Such losses, to the extent they are not adequately covered by contractual remedies or insurance, could affect our financial results. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us. If we, or other members of our protection and indemnity associations, were to sustain significant losses in the future, our ability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all could be materially adversely affected. For example, in the past our protection and indemnity associations have increased certain deductibles and determined not to cover certain categories of claims. Moreover, irrespective of the occurrence of such events, there can still be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all.\n​\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.\n​\nOur business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances, it may not be economical to defend against such matters, and a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n​\nAs a result of any ship-related or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us and/or our cruise brands. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. Subject to applicable insurance \n\n\n38\n\n\n\ncoverage, we may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined.\n​\nWe rely on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services, and we are exposed to risks facing such providers. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to replace such third parties or we may be forced to replace them at an increased cost to us.\n​\nWe rely on external third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services, such as technology and payment processing services, that are vital to our business. If these service providers suffer financial hardship or suffer disruptions or are unable to continue providing such services, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace such service providers in a timely manner, which may cause an interruption in our operations. To the extent that we are able to replace such service providers, we may be forced to pay an increased cost for equivalent services. Both the interruption of operations and the replacement of the third-party service providers at an increased cost could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.\n​\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase and own assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; most significantly a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, euro and Australian dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our other major currencies may adversely affect our U.S. dollar financial results and will reduce the U.S. dollar amount received upon conversion of these currencies into U.S. dollars.\n​\nWe have historically and may in the future enter into ship construction contracts denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. While we have entered into foreign currency derivatives to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with such contracts, we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portions of the ship construction contracts that have not been hedged. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would have a negative impact on our financial performance to the extent that these contracts have not been hedged. Additionally, if a shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract, any associated foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated.\n​\nOur expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects may not be successful.\n​\nWe believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our passenger sourcing into major markets in the future, such as Europe and Australia, as well as into emerging markets and to expand our itineraries in new markets. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have also made, and plan to continue to make, investments in land-based projects including port facilities and destination projects that are susceptible to impacts from, among other things, weather events, regulatory restrictions, labor risks, shortages of goods and materials and resistance from local populations. Any such impacts to our land-based projects could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nOvercapacity in key markets or globally could adversely affect our operating results.\n​\nWe continue to expand our fleet through our newbuild program and expect to add additional ships to our fleet. Our competitors have also announced similar expansions to their fleets. These increases in capacity in the cruise industry globally and potential overcapacity in certain key markets may cause us to lower pricing, which would reduce profitability and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, older ships in our fleet may not be as competitive as new ships enter the market and we may not be able to sell such older ships at optimal prices.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\nOur use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies may present business, compliance, and reputational risks. \nWe use AI technologies in some of our business processes, including some consumer-facing features. Developing our own AI technologies requires resources to develop, test, and maintain such technologies, which could be costly. Adding AI technologies, especially generative AI, in both new and existing business processes may introduce additional risks, including increased governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. Specifically, using AI technologies may lead to accuracy issues, security vulnerabilities, or biases, among other things, which may compromise data security, intellectual property, or client information, and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also fail to adopt AI technologies at an appropriate pace, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate\n​\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety, labor, data privacy and protection and maritime laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and certain recently introduced laws and regulations and future changes in laws and regulations could lead to increased costs and/or decreased revenue.\n​\nIncreasingly stringent and complex international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations addressing environmental protection and health and safety of workers could affect our operations. The IMO, a United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships, the Council of the European Union, individual countries, the United States, and individual states have implemented and are considering, new laws and rules to manage cruise ship operations. Many aspects of the cruise industry are subject to international treaties such as SOLAS, an international safety regulation, MARPOL, IMO’s requirements governing environmental protection, and STCW, an IMO regulation governing ship manning. In the United States, the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard both have regulations addressing cruise ship operations.\n​\nThe U.S. and various state and foreign government and regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations and policies aimed at restricting or taxing emissions, including those of greenhouse gases, requiring the use of low-sulfur fuels, requiring the use of shore power while in port, increasing fuel efficiency requirements, reducing the threat of invasive species in ballast water, and improving sewage and greywater-handling capabilities. For example, in 2021, the IMO adopted two requirements that went into effect in 2023, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (the “CII”) and Energy Efficiency Ship Index (the “EEXI”), which each regulate carbon emissions for ships. The CII is an operational metric designed to measure how efficiently a ship transports goods or passengers by looking at carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. Ships are given an annual rating from A to E with a C or better required for compliance. For ships that receive a D rating for three consecutive years, or an E rating for one year, a corrective action plan will need to be developed and approved. Beginning in 2023, ships are now required to reduce carbon intensity by 5% from a 2019 baseline, with 2% incremental improvements each year thereafter until 2030. The EEXI is a design re-certification requirement that updates energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and regulates carbon dioxide emissions related to installed engine power, transport capacity and ship speed. The maritime shipping sector has been included in the E.U.’s Emissions Trading System since the beginning of 2024. Under the directive ships over 5,000 Gross Tons that transport passengers or cargo to or from E.U. member state or EEA ports are required to purchase and surrender emissions allowances equivalent to emissions for all or a half of a covered voyage, depending on whether the voyage was between two E.U. or EEA ports or an E.U. or EEA and a non-E.U. or EEA port. The requirements are being phased in from 2024 to 2026. Beginning in 2024, covered entities are required to procure and surrender allowances equivalent to 40% of their carbon emissions, with the amount increasing to 70% of carbon emissions in 2025 and 100% of GHG emissions in 2026.\n​\nCompliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in increased costs to our Company and are expected to entail significant expenses for a combination of: ship modifications, purchases of emissions allowances, alternative fuels and higher-cost compliant newbuilds. Compliance is also expected to result in changes to our operating procedures, including limitations on our ability to operate in certain locations and slowing the speed of our ships and may render some ships obsolete, which would adversely impact our operations. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, \n\n\n40\n\n\n\nareas of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. We may not be able to comply with future and existing regulations and may be subject to fines, penalties and limitations on our ability to operate. Some environmental groups continue to lobby for more extensive oversight of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise industry and its environmental impact.\nAdditionally, in the past, states have implemented taxes that impact the cruise industry. It is possible that other states, countries or ports of call that our ships regularly visit may also decide to assess new taxes or fees or change existing taxes or fees specifically applicable to the cruise industry and its employees and/or guests, which could increase our operating costs and/or could decrease the demand for cruises.\n​\nChanges in tax laws, or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n​\nWe believe and have taken the position that our income that is considered to be derived from the international operation of ships as well as certain income that is considered to be incidental to such income (“shipping income”) is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Section 883, based upon certain assumptions as to shareholdings and other information as more fully described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation.” The provisions of Section 883 are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.\n​\nWe believe and have taken the position that substantially all of our income derived from the international operation of ships is properly categorized as shipping income and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which NCLH will satisfy complex stock ownership tests or the publicly-traded test under Section 883 as described in “Item 1—Business—Taxation—Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code.” There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH’s ordinary shares, which could cause us or our subsidiaries to lose the benefit of this tax exemption. Finally, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”), and we can give no assurances on this matter.\n​\nIf we or any of our subsidiaries were not to qualify for the exemption under Section 883, our or such subsidiary’s U.S.-source income would be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Regime (each as defined in “Item 1—Business—Taxation”). As of the date of this filing, we believe that NCLH and its subsidiaries will satisfy the publicly-traded test imposed under Section 883 and therefore believe that NCLH will qualify for the exemption under Section 883. However, as discussed above, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause NCLH to not meet the stock ownership or publicly-traded tests. Therefore, we can give no assurances on this matter. We refer you to “Item 1—Business—Taxation.”\n​\nWe may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property or operations involving foreign property that may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.\n​\nThe various tax regimes to which we have historically been subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, the OECD and numerous jurisdictions have had an increased focus on issues concerning the taxation of multinational businesses and have adopted several related reforms, including the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational businesses that was effective January 1, 2024 or later, which could have a material adverse effect on our aggregate tax liability and effective tax rate. During the fourth quarter of 2023, in response to the OECD’s BEPS 2.0 Pillar 2 global tax reform, the Company restructured its organizational structure by realigning many of its operations across its three different brands into a single jurisdiction, Bermuda. In connection with the reorganization, among other steps, certain NCLH subsidiaries were redomiciled to Bermuda. If our assumptions and interpretations regarding the global minimum tax rules or our efforts to reorganize prove to be incorrect for any reason, \n\n\n41\n\n\n\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We expect global tax reform will continue to evolve over the coming years and will continue to monitor these developments.\n​\nAdditionally, previously we obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax, including tax on profits or income among others, such tax shall not be applicable to them until March 31, 2035. Such assurances were superseded by the passage of new legislation as described below.\n​\nOn December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Act was enacted in Bermuda. Under the Bermuda Act, the corporate income tax will be determined based on a statutory tax rate of 15% effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The corporate income tax will apply only to Bermuda tax resident businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with €750 million or more in annual revenues in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the year in question. Although the Government of Bermuda has released limited guidance with respect to specific provisions of the Bermuda Act, it is anticipated that further administrative guidance as well as regulatory guidance will be released over the course of the 2025 calendar year and beyond.\n​\nAs enacted, the Bermuda Act makes it clear that any corporate income tax liability is due regardless of the above assurances under the Exempted Undertakings Protection Act 1966. Therefore, we expect to be subject to the Bermuda corporate income tax with effect from January 1, 2025. The Bermuda Act provides for an international shipping income exclusion. In order for a Bermuda entity’s international shipping income to qualify for the exclusion, the entity must demonstrate that the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from or within Bermuda. We believe we have met the necessary requirements to qualify for the international shipping income exclusion during 2024, but we cannot provide any assurances. Additionally, the Bermuda Act provides for companies to be able to offset 80% of their Bermuda taxable income with any tax loss deductions available on an annual basis. The Bermuda Act provides for opening tax loss carryforwards based on the Bermuda taxable income (loss) results of the individual Bermuda entities in the five fiscal years prior to the enactment date, which includes 2020 through 2024 calendar years for the Company. If our assumptions and interpretations regarding the Bermuda Act prove to be incorrect for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n​\nIn addition, there cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of applicable tax laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could increase our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n​\nOur ability to comply with economic substance requirements in certain jurisdictions and increased costs associated with our efforts to comply may have a negative impact on our operations.\n​\nOur Company and certain of its subsidiaries are or may be subject to economic substance requirements in their jurisdictions of formation or continuation, including, but not limited to, Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas and Saint Lucia. Pursuant to the legislation passed in each jurisdiction, entities subject to each jurisdiction’s laws that carry out relevant activities as specified in such laws, are required to demonstrate adequate economic substance in that jurisdiction and meet the economic substance requirements under such laws. In general terms, such economic substance requirements mean that: (i) the entity must be actually directed and managed in the jurisdiction; (ii) core income-generating activities relating to the applicable relevant activity must be performed in the jurisdiction; (iii) there are adequate suitably qualified employees in the jurisdiction; (iv) the entity maintains adequate physical presence in the jurisdiction; and (v) there is adequate operating expenditure incurred in the jurisdiction. We have evaluated the activities of NCLH, NCLC and their subsidiaries and have concluded that in some cases, those activities are “relevant activities” for the purposes of the applicable economic substance laws and that, consequently, certain entities within our organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with these economic substance requirements. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to increased costs and our management team may be required to devote significant time to satisfying economic substance requirements in certain of these jurisdictions. If such entities cannot demonstrate compliance with these requirements, we may be liable to pay penalties and fines in the \n\n\n42\n\n\n\napplicable jurisdictions and/or may take the decision to re-domicile such entities to different jurisdictions that may have tax regimes and other regulatory regimes which may be less favorable.\n​\nRisks Related to NCLH’s Ordinary Shares\n​\nShareholders of NCLH may have greater difficulties in protecting their interests than shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\n​\nWe are a Bermuda exempted company. The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the “Companies Act”), which applies to NCLH, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of NCLH’s bye-laws, some of these differences may result in you having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of NCLH than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our Company, what approvals are required for business combinations by our Company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or NCLH’s bye-laws, and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers.\n​\nNCLH does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n​\nNCLH does not currently pay dividends to its shareholders, and NCLH’s Board of Directors may never declare a dividend. Our existing debt agreements restrict, and any of our future debt arrangements may restrict, among other things, the ability of NCLH’s subsidiaries, including NCLC, to pay distributions to NCLH and NCLH’s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. In addition, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be entirely at the discretion of NCLH’s Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that NCLH’s Board of Directors deems relevant. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends. In addition, NCLH is a holding company and would depend upon its subsidiaries for their ability to pay distributions to NCLH to finance any dividend or pay any other obligations of NCLH. Investors seeking dividends should not purchase NCLH’s ordinary shares.\n​\nProvisions in NCLH’s constitutional documents may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that NCLH’s shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\n​\nNCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that its shareholders consider to be in their best interests. For instance, these provisions may prevent NCLH’s shareholders from receiving a premium to the market price of NCLH’s shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of NCLH’s shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions include (i) the ability of NCLH’s Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preference shares and issue preference shares without shareholder approval; (ii) a classified board of directors; (iii) the sole power of a majority of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fix the number of directors; (iv) the power of NCLH’s Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on NCLH’s Board of Directors in most circumstances, including when such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise; and (v) advance notice requirements for nominating directors or introducing other business to be conducted at shareholder meetings.\n​\nAdditionally, NCLH’s bye-laws contain provisions that prevent third parties from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of its outstanding shares without the consent of NCLH’s Board of Directors and provide for the lapse of rights, and sale, of any shares acquired in excess of that limit. The effect of these provisions may preclude third parties from seeking to acquire a controlling interest in NCLH in transactions that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may prevent them from receiving a premium above market price for their shares.\n​\n\n\n43",
