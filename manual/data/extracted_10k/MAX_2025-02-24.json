      "text": "Item 1. Business.\n\nOur Company\n\nOur mission is to help insurance carriers and distributors target and acquire consumers more efficiently and at greater scale through technology and data science. Our technology platform brings together leading insurance carriers and high-intent consumers through a real-time, programmatic, transparent, and results-driven ecosystem. We believe we are the largest online customer acquisition platform in our core verticals of property & casualty (“P&C”) insurance, health insurance, and life insurance, supporting $1.5 billion in Transaction Value(1) across our platform from these verticals during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nWe believe in the disruptive power of transparency. Traditionally, insurance customer acquisition platforms operated in a black box. We recognized that consumers may be valued differently by one insurer versus another; therefore, insurers should be able to determine pricing granularly based on the value that a particular customer segment is expected to bring to their business. As a result, we developed a technology platform that powers an ecosystem where buyers and sellers can transact with full transparency, control, and confidence.\n\nWe have multi-faceted relationships with top-tier insurance carriers and distributors. A buyer or a Demand Partner within our ecosystem is generally an insurance carrier or distributor seeking to reach high-intent insurance consumers. A seller or a Supply Partner is typically an insurance carrier looking to maximize the value of non-converting or low expected LTV consumers, or an insurance-focused research destination or other financial website looking to monetize the high-intent users on their websites. Our model’s versatility allows for the same insurance carrier or distributor to be both a Demand and Supply Partner, which deepens the partner’s relationship with us. In fact, it is this supply partnership that presents insurance carriers with a highly differentiated monetization opportunity, enabling them to capture revenue from website visitors who either do not qualify for a policy or otherwise may be more valuable as a potential referral to another carrier.\n\n1 “Transaction Value” is an operating metric that we present in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to supplement the financial information we present on a accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) basis. Transaction Value represents the total gross dollars transacted by our partners on our platform. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Key business and operating metrics.”\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we had 15 of the top 20 largest auto insurance carriers by customer acquisition spend as Demand Partners on our platform. Of these carriers, nearly half were also Supply Partners in our ecosystem. During 2024, consumers shopping for insurance products through the websites of our diversified group of Supply Partners and our proprietary websites produced an average of 9.9 million Consumer Referrals on our platform each month.\n\nWe believe our technology is a key differentiator and a powerful driver of our performance. We maintain deep, custom integrations with partners representing the majority of our Transaction Value, which enable automated, data-driven processes that optimize our partners’ customer acquisition spend and revenue. Through our platform, our insurance carrier partners can target and price across over 35 separate consumer attributes to manage customized acquisition strategies. Our platform’s granular price management tools and robust data science capabilities enable our insurance partners to target consumers based on a precise calculation of the expected lifetime value of the consumer to that partner and to make real-time, automated customer acquisition decisions.\n\nWe built our business model to align the interests of all parties participating on our platform. We generate revenue by earning a fee for each Consumer Referral sold on our platform. A transaction becomes payable upon a qualifying consumer action, such as a click, call or lead, and is generally not contingent on the sale of a product to the consumer.\n\nWe have a history of delivering strong growth in our Transaction Value and revenue, enabled by our unique business model and technology platform. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $1.5 billion of Transaction Value and $864.7 million of revenue, representing increases of 151.4% and 122.8%, respectively, compared with the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to an increase in customer acquisition spending by P&C insurance carriers in response to improvements in their underwriting profitability. We have developed multi-faceted, deeply integrated partnerships with insurance carriers and distributors, who may be both Demand Partners and Supply Partners on our platform. We believe the versatility and breadth of our offerings, coupled with our focus on high-quality products, provide significant value to insurance carriers and distributors, leading many of them to use our platform as their central hub for broadly managing digital customer acquisition and monetization, resulting in strong retention rates.\n\nIn our health and life insurance verticals, we continue to support carriers and brokers in customer acquisition, and we believe we are well positioned to support them as they shift towards more direct, digital distribution. We aim to drive deeper adoption and integration of our platform within the insurance ecosystem to continue delivering strong results to our partners. \n\nWe expect the broad secular trends driving our historical growth to resume as P&C carrier profitability continues to recover and they increase their customer acquisition investments on our platform. See “Part II Item 7 - Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Results of operations” for more information.\n\nWe designed our business model to be capital efficient, with high operating leverage and cash flow conversion. We have funded our growth primarily through internally generated cash flow, with no outside primary capital. Our strong cash flow generation is driven by (i) the nature of our revenue model, which is fee based and generated at the time a Consumer Referral is sold, and (ii) our proprietary technology platform, which is highly scalable and requires minimal capital expenditures  ($0.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively).\n\nThe foundation of our success is our company culture. Personal development is critical to our team’s engagement and retention, and we continually invest to support our core values of open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, candor, and humility. This has resulted in a growth-minded team, with low turnover, committed to building great products and the long-term success of our partners.\n\nOur market opportunity\n\nInsurance is one of the largest industries in the United States, with attractive growth characteristics and market fundamentals. Insurance companies wrote approximately $3 trillion in premiums in 2023, growing at a 9% CAGR from 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Demand for insurance products is stable, due to, in many instances, coverage being mandated by law (for example, auto insurance) or federally subsidized (for example, senior health insurance). The insurance industry as a whole is highly competitive and invests heavily in customer acquisition. Digital insurance advertising spend is expected to grow at double digit rates annually over the next few years. According to eMarketer, insurance digital advertising spend in the U.S. was $9 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to approximately $14 billion by 2026.\n\nOur technology platform was created to serve and grow with our insurance end markets. While the P&C insurance industry experienced underwriting losses from 2021 till 2023 driven by inflation in automobile replacement and repair costs, it recovered strongly during 2024 and we believe that the secular trends in the insurance industry will provide strong tailwinds for our business over the long term.\n\n•Direct-to-consumer is the fastest growing insurance distribution channel. In the auto insurance industry, there are carriers focused on DTC distribution (such as Progressive and GEICO) and carriers focused more on traditional, agent-based distribution (such as State Farm, Liberty Mutual and Allstate). The industry shift to more direct distribution is accelerating. A major driver of this growth has been the DTC carriers’ outsized investments, relative to peers, in direct customer acquisition channels. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Progressive and GEICO's advertising spend in 2023 was $1.2 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.  Traditional, agent-based carriers have responded by investing more heavily in direct customer acquisition efforts themselves, as well as launching digital brands (such as Nationwide launching Spire), acquiring digital agencies, or acquiring digital insurers (such as Allstate acquiring SquareTrade).\n\n•More insurance consumers are shopping online. Consumers are increasingly using the internet not just for research and price discovery, but to purchase insurance as well. According to TransUnion, the number of consumers shopping for insurance online rose from 22% in 2022 to 27% in 2023. Additionally, according to a \n\n8\n\n\nYouGov plc survey in 2024, 48% of U.S. consumers prefer buying insurance online. Younger consumers are not the only driving force of this shift; the share of digitally savvy older consumers is rapidly growing as well.  According to the Pew Research Center, internet usage among adults aged 65 and older has grown from 66% in 2018 to 90% in 2024.\n\n•Insurance customer acquisition spending is growing. Total customer acquisition spend in the insurance industry was estimated to be $146 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to approximately $176 billion by 2025, according to William Blair. In fact, three of the top fifteen most-advertised brands in the U.S. across traditional and online channels are insurance companies—Progressive, GEICO, and State Farm. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Progressive’s customer acquisition spend was $1.2 billion in 2023, while GEICO’s customer acquisition spend was $0.8 billion in the same period. In the face of such aggressive spending and customer acquisition by DTC carriers such as Progressive and GEICO, agent-based carriers are compelled to spend heavily to remain competitive.\n\n•Digital customer acquisition spending by insurers has plenty of headroom. According to William Blair, insurance carriers allocate a lower percentage of their advertising budgets to digital channels than other industries. While the advertising industry as a whole was estimated to allocate approximately 66% of their budgets to digital in 2021, insurers allocated less than 22% of their budgets to digital channels in that year. Industry analysts expect digital marketing spend by the insurance industry to narrow this gap significantly over time as more consumers shop online and carriers increase their adoption of digital channels.\n\n•Carriers and distributors are increasingly focused on optimizing customer acquisition budgets. Mass-market customer acquisition spend is becoming more costly, leading carriers and distributors to increasingly focus on optimizing customer acquisition spend. They are able to do so by adopting more sophisticated customer acquisition strategies enabled by data science. A significant percentage of marketers believe the inability to measure customer acquisition impact across channels and campaigns is one of their biggest challenges in demonstrating customer acquisition performance. We believe there is growing demand for improved transparency of Consumer Referral quality, for the ability to secure higher quality Consumer Referrals online, and for the ability to manage consumer acquisition spend across multiple vendors.\n\nMediaAlpha is poised to capitalize on these trends. We believe that we provide the leading technology platform enabling insurance carriers and distributors to efficiently acquire customers online at scale. Our platform allows Demand Partners to target consumers granularly and to determine their pricing based on how they value various consumer segments. Demand Partners leveraging our data science capabilities make value-maximizing decisions on how to acquire consumers. This results in greater customer acquisition efficiency and better return on investment, allowing us to attract more Demand Partners into the ecosystem. Simultaneously, we provide our Supply Partners the insights and tools they need to drive competition for their high-intent consumers and maximize yield, which draws more Supply Partners into the ecosystem, providing our Demand Partners with even more high-quality demand sources. As both Demand and Supply Partners begin to see the benefits of the platform, we deepen our relationships with them through additional integrations that drive more data into the platform. All of this creates the powerful “flywheel” effect that has propelled our business forward as a result of the value created within our ecosystem.\n\n9\n\n\nOur platform\n\nWe have created one of the largest insurance customer acquisition technology platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had $1.5 billion in Transaction Value and served over 1,000 total insurance partners, excluding our agent partners. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had $593.4 million in Transaction Value and served over 920 total insurance partners, excluding our agent partners.\n\nDuring 2024, high-intent consumers shopping for insurance products on the websites of sellers on our platform and our proprietary websites resulted in approximately 119 million Consumer Referrals acquired by Demand Partners on our platform. We serve over 700 Demand Partners, excluding our agent partners, in our insurance verticals. Our platform was designed to support multiple Consumer Referral products and flexible deployment models to best serve the varying needs of our partners.\n\nInsurance carriers access our platform through a self-service web interface that enables them to manage customer acquisition strategies across all sources of Consumer Referrals, efficiently and with full transparency. Our platform provides insurance companies sophisticated targeting capabilities for efficient customer acquisition. Further, it offers our carrier partners the ability to offset their customer acquisition costs by using predictive analytics to identify and refer non-converting consumers to other carriers, delivering better returns on investment relative to traditional channels.\n\n10\n\n\nWe connect insurance companies with websites where consumers shop for insurance. Insurance carriers and distributors are able to target high-intent consumers when they are actively shopping for insurance. Our end consumers typically access our partners’ websites or our proprietary websites looking for an insurance quote, where they volunteer relevant data in connection with their quote request. Our platform then controls the matching of these consumers with insurance companies, presenting them with multiple brands to choose from. We believe the rich data available with every consumer quote request gives our platform the unparalleled ability to direct each Consumer Referral to the right set of carriers. We maximize value to both Demand and Supply Partners by allowing insurance companies to reach consumers when they are actively shopping at the point of purchase and precisely target granular consumer segments using rich data.\n\n11\n\n\nWe enable insurance companies to reach and acquire new customers in multiple ways. On our platform, end consumers can engage with insurance companies through multiple touchpoints based on their preferences. Our platform enables consumers to (i) proceed to an insurance carrier’s website on a self-directed basis to purchase a policy (click), (ii) engage with an insurance carrier or agent via phone (call), or (iii) have their data submitted to insurance companies to receive inbound contacts (lead). Our platform’s flexibility in turn enables insurance carriers to acquire and convert consumers through one or more touchpoints, depending on their strengths and preferences.\n\nThe following table presents the percentages of total Transaction Value generated from clicks, calls and leads for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\nYear endedDecember 31,\n\n20242023\n\nClicks84.1 %69.4 %\n\nCalls9.4 %18.6 %\n\nLeads6.5 %12.0 %\n\nOur platform leverages precise data and data science for maximum efficiency. Insurance carriers use precise data to target and price consumer segments across demographic and geographic attributes on a source transparent basis. This allows insurance carriers to pay the right price for each Consumer Referral based on their business objectives. Insurance carriers can integrate with our platform to provide real-time conversion feedback, allowing them to measure returns on their spending granularly and execute algorithmic optimization of customer acquisition cost based on the expected LTV of the customer. Increasing the number and depth of our conversion data integrations with our partners remains a key part of our strategy.\n\nInsurance carriers are able to extract the maximum value from each consumer opportunity. We have extensive data integrations with our partners to support efficient customer acquisition. These data integrations allow us to more seamlessly transact a Consumer Referral by taking information an end consumer has already provided and pre-populating it into an insurance carrier’s purchase process, streamlining and simplifying the process for the consumer and potentially increasing policy conversion rates. This enhances the value of the Consumer Referral to our insurance carriers, adding significant value to all parties in our platform. As of December 31, 2024, we had 119 Demand Partners with this type of integration in place for active and future campaigns, representing 84% of the total Transaction Value from our insurance verticals for the year then ended. Increasing the number and depth of our data integrations with our partners remains a key part of our strategy, and we believe this number will increase as our platform grows.\n\nOur transaction models. We transact with our Demand Partners and Supply Partners through two operating models, Open Marketplace and Private Marketplace. In our Open Marketplace transactions, we have separate agreements with Demand Partners and Supply Partners and have control over the Consumer Referrals that are sold to our Demand Partners. In our Private Marketplace transactions, Demand Partners and Supply Partners contract with one another directly, and we earn fees from our Supply Partners based on the value of the Consumer Referrals transacted on our platform. For more information regarding these arrangements, see “Management’s discussion and analysis-Key components of our results of operations-Revenue.”\n\nOur technology\n\nOur technology platform allows insurance carriers and distributors to acquire customers and optimize customer acquisition costs to align with expected customer LTV, in a single data-rich but user-friendly environment. Our technology is what enables our growth, scale, and operating leverage, and is a key part of what differentiates us from our competitors. It is also what enables our partners to scale their customer acquisition and monetization efficiently and with minimal operating overhead. With nearly 119 million Consumer Referrals transacted on our platform in 2024, we believe we offer the largest source of Consumer Referrals in the insurance sector.\n\nOur product is a robust, real-time customer acquisition and data analytics platform. It is fueled by rich, anonymized consumer data provided by our extensive data integrations with our partners. At the heart of our platform is a set of proprietary predictive analytics algorithms that incorporate hundreds of variables to generate conversion probabilities for each unique consumer, enabling our partners to align customer acquisition costs with expected customer LTV across the platform.\n\nOur platform architecture is elegant, scalable, and vertical agnostic, which has enabled us to innovate rapidly in our core insurance verticals and grow opportunistically across sectors with similarly attractive attributes. We continuously invest in our technology and believe that our focus on innovation enhances our competitive position.\n\n12\n\n\nWe believe the following attributes collectively differentiate the MediaAlpha technology platform:\n\nMultiple high-quality Consumer Referrals accessible through a single platform with transparent pricing and control. Most insurance carriers and distributors today have multiple sources for customer acquisition. These sources offer a wide range of Consumer Referral quality and, in most cases, must be managed manually and separately by insurance carriers. Our platform allows users to access multiple sources of Consumer Referrals transparently through a unified platform with a single sign-on, creating scale and operational efficiencies.\n\nProprietary user data integrated in a secure environment. Our platform allows buyers to fully integrate first-party consumer data to enhance targeting parameters, bidding granularity, and conversion tracking, resulting in more accurate customer acquisition and LTV predictions. We believe we maintain robust data security protections and preserve the confidentiality of each insurance carrier’s customer acquisition strategy. We are able to seamlessly aggregate this data across all of our users to enhance our data analytics models while maintaining end-consumer confidentiality. We believe this has allowed us to continue strengthening our rich consumer database and analytics platform and to maintain strong relationships with our partners.\n\nRobust data science tools to optimize customer acquisition. Our unique search and conversion datasets enable automated, algorithmic customer acquisition optimizations. As our platform grows and processes more customer acquisition transactions, we gather more conversion data to further refine our predictive analytics algorithms. This further enhances our platform’s capability to predict our partners’ expected return per consumer and support more efficient customer acquisition strategies. We believe this creates a flywheel effect by which the attractiveness and value of our platform will continue to grow as we scale our marketplaces.\n\nSelf-service model. We offer a self-service model that empowers our partners to directly manage the buying and selling process independently. Supply Partners can easily manage their digital consumer traffic on our platform, while Demand Partners can direct their consumer acquisition spend in real time with minimal involvement from our team. We believe this enables us to scale efficiently without requiring significant investments in sales and support functions.\n\nHighly extensible and scalable platform. Our platform and industry-agnostic technology enables us to quickly expand our operations into existing and adjacent verticals with minimal investments. We have organically scaled the P&C insurance vertical and the health and life insurance verticals to $1.2 billion and $300.9 million in Transaction Value, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. While our primary focus remains on insurance, we intend to continue to grow opportunistically in sectors with similar, attractive market fundamentals. We believe our proprietary technology will allow us to react nimbly to growing demands and opportunities in emerging verticals.\n\nOur target audience\n\nOur buyers: Our Demand Partners are insurance carriers and distributors looking to target high-intent consumers deep in their purchase journey. Repeat buyers continue to be a strong driver of our business, with 96% of our Transaction Value for 2024 coming from Demand Partner relationships in existence during 2023 and 93% of our Transaction Value for 2023 coming from Demand Partner relationships in existence during 2022. \n\nOur value proposition for buyers\n\n•Efficiency at scale. We believe we operate the insurance industry’s largest customer acquisition platform, delivering the volume of Consumer Referrals insurance companies need to drive profitable growth, while also providing precise targeting capabilities to ensure they connect with the right prospects. We believe this gives our Demand Partners the ability to realize greater efficiencies relative to other customer acquisition channels.\n\n•Granular and transparent control. Our platform allows for real-time, granular control and full source transparency with every buying and pricing decision. We believe this gives our buyers the flexibility they need to realize favorable LTV relative to customer acquisition costs to maximize their revenue opportunities and the effectiveness of their marketing investments.\n\n•Unparalleled partnership. With a fully managed service option, custom integrations, and industry-leading technology, we are dedicated to providing long-term value to our Demand Partners’ businesses. We have designed our platform to put the best interests of our partners first, fostering a healthy ecosystem within which buyers can transact with confidence.\n\n13\n\n\nOur sellers: Our Supply Partners use our platform to monetize their digital consumer traffic. Our Supply Partners are primarily insurance carriers looking to maximize the value of non-converting or low LTV consumers, and insurance-focused research destinations or other financial websites looking to monetize high-intent customers. Repeat sellers continue to be a strong driver of our business, with 99% of our Transaction Value for 2024 and 2023 coming from Supply Partner relationships in existence during 2023 and 2022.\n\nOur value proposition for sellers\n\n•Yield maximization. Our proprietary technology platform provides sellers with a suite of optimization tools, as well as inventory and buyer management features, that maximize competition for, and yield from, their high-intent consumers.\n\n•Predictive analysis. Through our platform’s advanced predictive analysis and data science capabilities, sellers can assess conversion probabilities and expected customer LTV for every consumer in real time. We believe the integration of these data science models with our sellers’ user experience decision engines is a unique differentiator of our business.\n\n•Real-time insights. We provide our sellers with unique data as to the type of consumer segments each buyer values. By providing in-depth reporting and real-time, granular insights, our sellers have the ability to continuously optimize their own customer acquisition and monetization decisions.\n\nOur end consumers: Our end consumers are primarily high-intent, online insurance shoppers. Due to the broad participation of top-tier insurance carriers within our ecosystem, consumers are able to more efficiently navigate a range of options and offers relevant to their policy searches. During the year ended December 31, 2024, high-intent consumers shopped for insurance products on the websites of sellers on our platform and our proprietary websites, resulting in approximately 119 million Consumer Referrals acquired by buyers on our platform.\n\nOur value proposition for end consumers\n\n•Search relevancy. By enabling insurance carriers and distributors to apply sophisticated targeting, we facilitate the delivery of hyper-relevant product options to our end consumers based on consumer-provided demographics and other relevant characteristics. We believe this improves the overall research and purchase experience and helps enable our end consumers to make better decisions.\n\n•Shopping efficiency. We facilitate access to the most relevant products for each respective end consumer, allowing for minimal research and maximum efficiency, through an omni-channel, seamless consumer platform experience. We enable consumers to get quotes from multiple insurance carriers and distributors in different ways, including directly online or offline.\n\nOur strengths\n\nWe believe that our competitive advantages are based on the following key strengths:\n\n•Highly scalable, innovative technology platform with rich data. Our proprietary platform is built to be highly extensible and flexible, enabling us to quickly and efficiently develop custom solutions and tools to address the varying and evolving needs of our partners. Supported by our proprietary algorithms, our platform is able to provide continuous, real-time feedback and insights that buyers can use to maximize the value of every consumer opportunity. Our deep data integrations allow our buyers to utilize millions of anonymized data points to target and acquire their desired customers with a unique level of precision and control. As of December 31, 2024, there were over 400 insurance Supply Partners on our platform. We also provide our Supply Partners with sophisticated, data-driven yield management and monetization capabilities. We believe these capabilities are critical to our partners’ monetization strategies, as they enable optimization of business performance and revenue. Our platform is vertical agnostic, allowing us to quickly and easily expand into new markets with attractive attributes.\n\nThe increased participation in our technology-driven platform continues to generate valuable data, enhance feedback loops, and drive stronger results for all participants in the ecosystem. We believe this creates a flywheel effect as our platform continues to grow.\n\n•Superior operating leverage. We designed our business to be highly scalable, driving sustainable long-term growth that delivers superior value to both Demand and Supply Partners. Our technology enables us to grow rapidly in a highly capital efficient manner, with minimal need for working capital or capital expenditure \n\n14\n\n\ninvestment. In 2024, we employed an average of 139 individuals, who produced $1.5 billion of Transaction Value ($10.7 million per employee), $22.1 million of net income ($0.2 million per employee), and $96.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA ($0.7 million per employee) and in 2023, we employed 142 individuals on average who drove $593.4 million of Transaction Value ($4.2 million per employee), $56.6 million of net loss ($0.4 million per employee), and $27.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA ($0.2 million per employee) for the year.  We believe that this illustrates the flexibility and scalability of our platform and the operating leverage of our business model, as we were able to grow Transaction Value and Adjusted EBITDA significantly in 2024 as the P&C insurance industry recovered, without a meaningful increase in our headcount.\n\n•Sticky, tenured relationships with insurance carriers and distributors. We have developed multi-faceted, deeply-integrated partnerships with insurance carriers and distributors, which may be both Demand Partners and Supply Partners on our platform. We enable insurance carriers and distributors as buyers to optimize their customer acquisition spend by offering source-level transparency, granular controls, and predictive tools to drive measurably superior performance. When we work with carriers and distributors as sellers, we enable them to use data science to turn high-intent policy shoppers unlikely to purchase a policy from that specific carrier or distributor into highly valuable Consumer Referrals for other carriers or distributors, thereby offsetting a portion of their total customer acquisition costs.\n\nWe believe the versatility and breadth of our offerings, coupled with our focus on high-quality products, provide significant value to insurance carriers and distributors, resulting in strong retention rates. Our relationships with our partners are deep, longstanding, and involve top-tier insurance carriers in the industry. 15 of the top 20 largest auto insurance carriers by customer acquisition spend are Demand Partners on our platform. In 2024, 96% of total Transaction Value executed on our platform came from Demand Partner relationships in existence during 2023. In 2023, 93% of total Transaction Value executed on our platform came from Demand Partner relationships in existence during 2022.\n\n•Culture of transparency, innovation, and execution. Since inception, our vision has been to bring unparalleled transparency and efficiency to the online customer acquisition ecosystem, executed through a powerful technology-enabled platform. Transparency is built into our platform and is at the heart of our culture, enabling us to focus on sustainable long-term success over near-term wins. We are relentless about continuous innovation and aim to use our platform to solve big industry-wide problems. We are data-driven and focused on delivering measurable results for our partners. We believe that our long-term vision, dedication to solving systemic problems in the industry, and our relentless drive to improve, will continue to empower us to be the platform of choice for our partners.\n\nOur growth opportunities\n\nWe intend to grow our business through the following key areas:\n\n•Increase Transaction Value from our partners. We aim to increase overall Transaction Value from our partners across our insurance verticals by continuously improving the volume and accuracy of customer conversion data analyzed in our platform, eliminating friction between consumer handoffs, and developing additional tools and features to increase engagement. We believe that providing our platform participants with better value and a larger selection of high-quality Consumer Referrals over time will lead to increased spending on our platform.\n\n•Improve ecosystem efficiency. We believe that traditional customer acquisition models are highly inefficient, charging platform users inflated prices while lacking the transparency and granularity to allow participants to reach end consumers effectively. Our platform is designed to disrupt and address these systemic inefficiencies by enhancing automated buying strategies and granular price discovery processes. We will continue to expand our platform and drive value for all participants within the ecosystem by increasing the number and depth of data integrations with our partners.\n\n•Bring new partners to our platform. There are potential Demand and Supply Partners who are not yet using our platform, and new companies are being formed every year. We intend to gain adoption of our platform with new insurance partners through business development, word-of-mouth referrals, and inbound inquiries.\n\n15\n\n\n•Grow our product offerings. We are constantly exploring new ways to deliver value to our partners through development of new tools and services and improvement of our conversion analytics model. We believe that providing further customized solutions and higher touch services for our partners will enhance the stickiness of our offerings and drive more customer acquisition spend and users to our platform.\n\n•Deepen our relationships with agents. We continue to strategically expand our insurance agency relationships to capture additional customer acquisition spend within our core insurance verticals. We have a dedicated team working to incorporate agents into our digital platform and help them expand their customer acquisition capabilities. We added over 1,200 agents to our platform in the year ended December 31, 2024. This dedicated team will continue to enhance our agency capabilities.\n\n•Expand into and scale new verticals. While we are currently focused on growing our core insurance verticals, we continue to seek expansion opportunities in markets that share similar characteristics. We believe our vertical-agnostic platform and established playbook for entering new markets will allow us to capture attractive market opportunities effectively if we decide to pursue such opportunities. We believe we have the ability to enter most new verticals with only a modest increase in headcount.\n\nOur competition\n\nWe operate in the broadly defined tech-enabled insurance distribution sector. We are part of a sector that is disrupting the conventional agent-based insurance distribution channels. This sector is comprised of companies engaged in varied aspects of customer acquisition. On one end of the spectrum, there are companies that are engaged in simple Consumer Referrals acquisition, which they sell to insurance carriers or distributors. On the other end of the spectrum, there are companies that acquire the customer through digital channels and take them through the entire needs-based assessment and policy application and submission process.\n\nWithin this sector, our closest competitors are technology companies engaged in digital customer acquisition. Traditional digital consumer acquisition models focus on serving buyers of Consumer Referrals by acquiring consumers from paid search, proprietary websites or other digital avenues and selling them to insurance carriers or producers. Our model is different. We operate a two-sided marketplace where sophisticated Demand and Supply Partners buy and sell high-quality Consumer Referrals. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including return on investment, technology, and client service.\n\nOur platform also offers DTC digital spend optimization capabilities that compete primarily with home grown systems that buyers use to aggregate multiple sources of digital customer acquisition. As the number of digital consumer acquisition sources grows, the complexity and cost of managing those sources continues to increase. As a result, over time we have seen significant increases in the number of participants on our platform, further enhancing our scale and return on investment to all our partners. We have deep integrations with our partners that are costly and time consuming to implement. We believe our scale makes it hard for new entrants to gain direct access to buyers and sellers and replicate what we have built over the years.\n\nIntellectual property\n\nThe protection of our technology, intellectual property and proprietary rights is an important aspect of our business. We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and technology. Additionally, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, including our buyers and sellers. However, our contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property or proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.\n\nOur in-house know-how is an important element of our intellectual property. The development and management of our platform requires sophisticated coordination among many specialized employees. We believe that duplication of this coordination by competitors or individuals seeking to copy our platform would be difficult. The risk of a competitor effectively replicating the functionality of our platform is further mitigated by the fact that our service offerings are cloud-based, such that most of the core technology operating on our systems is never exposed to a user or to our competitors. To protect our technology, we implement multiple layers of security. Access to our platform, other than to obtain basic information, requires system usernames and passwords. We also add additional layers of security such as dual-factor authentication for some users, \n\n16\n\n\nencryption in transit and intrusion detection. See “Risk factors-Risks related to our intellectual property rights and our technology.”\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur results are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations as a result of vertical level seasonality. Our property & casualty insurance vertical is typically characterized by seasonal weakness during our fourth quarter due to lower customer acquisition budgets from buyers and lower supply of Consumer Referrals during the holiday period. During our first quarter, our P&C insurance vertical typically exhibits seasonal strength as customer acquisition budgets from our Demand Partners and Consumer Referral volume from our Supply Partners both increase sequentially.\n\nOur health insurance vertical typically experiences seasonal strength during the fourth quarter due to a material increase in Consumer Referrals and a related increase in customer acquisition budgets in connection with the Medicare annual enrollment period, which generally runs from October 15 to December 7 each year, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) open enrollment period, which generally runs from November 1 through December 15 in many states, with the last ending on January 31st of the following year. Customer acquisition spending in our health insurance vertical is typically lower during the other quarters of the year because most consumers enroll in these plans during the annual and open enrollment periods. The seasonal strength in the fourth quarter results in a higher level of accounts receivable related to our health insurance vertical as of our fiscal year-end, which are typically collected during the subsequent first quarter. \n\nRegulation\n\nVarious aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. We are subject to laws and regulations that apply to businesses in general, such as those relating to worker classification, employment, payments, worker confidentiality obligations, consumer protection and taxation. For example, in October 2024 the FTC Staff asserted that we have violated violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Government Impersonation Rule. See “Risk Factors - The FTC Matter could have a material adverse effect on our business.” As an online business, we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the internet, such as those relating to intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the distribution of electronic communications, search engines, consumer privacy, and internet tracking technologies, and could be affected by potential changes to laws and regulations that affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including with respect to net neutrality and taxation on the use of the internet or e-commerce transactions.  \n\nBecause we collect, process, store, share, disclose, transfer and use consumer information and other data and engage in marketing and advertising activities via the phone, email and text messages, we are also subject to laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, retention, security, protection transfer and other processing of personal information and other data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) and other state privacy laws, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (“CASL”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”), the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), supplemented by national laws (such as, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 2018) and further implemented through binding guidance from the European Data Protection Board, and the EU’s ePrivacy Directive, which is expected to be replaced by the EU’s ePrivacy Regulation, which is still under development and will replace current national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply. We take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures to protect our data, including data pertaining to our end consumers, employees and business partners. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.\n\nA substantial majority of the insurance carriers using our platform are P&C insurance carriers, health and/or Medicare insurance carriers or life insurance carriers. As a result, we are affected by laws and regulations relating to the insurance and healthcare industries, both of which are heavily regulated. In addition, during 2021 we became a licensed health insurance broker in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, which has subjected us to laws and regulations applicable to insurance brokers and to the authority of the insurance regulators in those jurisdictions. The laws and regulations applicable to these industries have changed significantly in recent years, and other changes may occur in the future. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and related regulatory reforms have materially changed the regulation of health insurance. In addition, recent and proposed changes in the regulations governing the marketing of Medicare insurance have \n\n17\n\n\nmaterially changed the rules regarding how such policies are marketed, and may materially restrict our ability to sell Consumer Referrals to certain buyers in the future. While it is difficult to determine the impact of potential reforms on our future business, it is possible that such changes in industry regulation could affect our operations and/or demand for our platform.\n\nBecause the laws and regulations governing the internet, privacy, data security, marketing, insurance and healthcare are constantly evolving and striving to keep pace with innovations in technology and media, it is possible that we may need to materially alter the way we conduct some parts of our business activities or be prohibited from conducting such activities altogether at some point in the future. See “Risk factors-Risks related to laws and regulation.”\n\nEmployees\n\nWe are committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. The employee traits we value include a hands-on approach no matter the experience level, intellectual curiosity, open-mindedness, a growth mindset, and caring deeply about the quality of one’s work. As of December 31, 2024, we had 144 full-time employees. The human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, compensation and pay equity, and employee health and welfare. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nEmployee Engagement and Development\n\nOur employee engagement efforts include regular “all-hands” meetings and frequent executive communications, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to maximize transparency. We believe in continual improvement and use employee feedback to drive and improve processes that support our customers and ensure a deep understanding of our employees’ needs.  We conduct annual confidential employee surveys and believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improves individual performance. Each year, our employees participate in a 360-degree evaluation process to identify critical capabilities for development and establish new stretch goals.\n\nWe seek to achieve our business objectives through a deep commitment to talent development. Our talent development efforts include quarterly goals, “lunch and learn” events, individualized professional development plans, leadership team and management training, internal workshops, and guest speakers.\n\nWe use a combination of company and department goals to drive the execution of our business strategy.  All of our teams participate in an annual strategic planning process to identify objectives for business growth and innovation, and set and review goals throughout the year to support the Company’s annual objectives.\n\nPay Equity\n\nOur employee compensation strategy is designed to support three primary objectives: to attract and retain the best team members, to reflect and reinforce our most important values, and to align team member interests with shareholder interests in building enduring value. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we monitor market compensation levels and set pay ranges based on market data, and we consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their performance in making compensation decisions. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure that we compensate our employees in a fair and equitable manner. We also comply with the applicable pay transparency laws by ensuring that our job postings and applicant/employee requests for compensation information are in compliance with state or local laws.\n\n18\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWe remain committed to fostering, cultivating, and maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion. Our philosophy and actions are built on the premise that as an employer and citizens of our communities, we can create opportunities for lasting change.  Our core values speak to the importance of individuality, transparency, and challenging ourselves to actively learn and grow together.  We continue to assess our company practices with the intent of creating sustainable programs over the long-term, recognizing the importance of prioritizing progress over perfection.\n\nCommunity Involvement\n\nWe aim to enhance the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back to charities of their choice and the Company matches team member contributions to qualified 501(c)(3) organizations, up to $2,500 per team member per calendar year and also by offering employees paid volunteer time each year. We also offer company-sponsored volunteer events to our employees.\n\nEmployee Health and Welfare\n\nOur employee benefits package is tailored to meet a variety of our employees’ needs, including generous health insurance benefits, 401(k) matching contributions, generous parental and other leave benefits, open paid time-off, and a charitable giving program for employees to support causes and organizations that have special meaning to them.\n\nWe employ a hybrid work schedule, with most employees working in one of our offices two days per week, and working remotely on other days, to offer employees the flexibility they need to balance their personal and work lives.  To cover the costs and help ease the stress of working from home, we provide our employees with benefits such as internet and cell phone reimbursement, office supply purchasing, flexible work schedules, and access to other tools.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nWe file with the SEC Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.\n\nOur internet website address is https://www.mediaalpha.com/.  We make available on our internet website, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.",

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nRisks related to our business and industry\n\nOur business is dependent on our relationships with our partners using our platform, many of which have no long-term contractual commitments with us. If Demand Partners stop purchasing Consumer Referrals on our platform, if Supply Partners stop making Consumer Referrals available on our platform, or if we are unable to establish and maintain new relationships with Demand or Supply Partners on our platform, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nA substantial majority of our revenue is derived from sales of Consumer Referrals to Demand Partners on our platform. Our relationships with such Demand Partners are dependent on our ability to make quality Consumer Referrals available on our platform at attractive volumes and prices, which in turn depends on our relationship with our Supply Partners. If Demand Partners are not able to acquire their preferred Consumer Referrals on our platform, they may stop purchasing on our platform. If Demand Partners are not able to reach desired consumer segments precisely or do not achieve their desired return on their customer acquisition spend, they may stop using our platform.\n\nSupply Partners use our platform to optimize consumer conversions and the yield on their traffic. If Supply Partners are not able to obtain the best yield on their traffic using our platform, they may stop using our platform to make their Consumer Referrals available.\n\nThe majority of our partners can stop using our platform at any time with no notice. Many of our agreements with our partners have no fixed term and are cancellable upon 30 or 60 days’ notice. Furthermore, the agreements with our partners do not require that such partners transact a minimum amount on our platform. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our partners will continue to work with us, or, if they do, the amount of Consumer Referrals Demand Partners will purchase or the amount of Consumer Referrals Supply Partners will make available on our platform.\n\nIf a partner is not satisfied with our platform, it could cause us to lose our relationship with them. In addition to a loss of revenue, this may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain business or secure new business with other partners. The success of our platform depends on both our Supply Partners making available a robust supply of Consumer Referrals and our Demand Partners’ willingness to pay to purchase such Consumer Referrals. Accordingly, the loss of a Supply Partner’s traffic could affect our ability to provide a sufficient supply of Consumer Referrals for Demand Partners to acquire. In turn, the loss of a Demand Partner’s purchasing power on our platform could decrease the payouts to Supply Partners, which could decrease our supply of Consumer Referrals.\n\nWe may decide to terminate our relationship with a partner for a number of reasons and at any time. For example, in October 2020, we terminated our relationship with a Supply Partner that represented approximately 2% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have also terminated Demand Partners for various reasons, including violations of our contractual terms and/or our Code of Conduct.  The termination of our relationship with a partner could reduce the number of Demand Partners seeking to purchase Consumer Referrals and Supply Partners seeking to sell their Consumer Referrals to our platform. In connection with such a termination, we would lose a source of Transaction Value and fees for future sales. Our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could also be harmed if in the future we fail to develop new partner relationships.\n\nWe depend on a small group of Demand and Supply Partners for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in our relationships with these partners may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe derive a large portion of our revenue from our Demand Partners through their purchases of Consumer Referrals provided by our Supply Partners. A limited number of our Demand and Supply Partners account for a substantial portion of our business. Our largest Demand Partner represented 23% and 7% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and our next largest Demand Partner represented 18% and 6% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our top 20 Demand Partners represented 72% and 41% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe majority of our agreements with our Demand and Supply Partners do not include minimum transaction volume commitments, and accordingly, our Supply Partners can reduce or cease the volume of Consumer Referrals they provide to our platform, and/or our Demand Partners can reduce or cease their purchasing on our platform at any time. In addition, many of our agreements with our Demand and Supply Partners are terminable by the partner without cause upon 30 or 60 days’ notice. Should we become dependent on fewer Demand or Supply Partner relationships (whether as a result of the termination of existing relationships, insurance carrier consolidation or otherwise), we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with, or demand for our Consumer Referrals from, our Demand or Supply Partners, which in turn could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. We expect to obtain payment from our customers for work performed and maintain an allowance for credit losses against receivables for potential losses on partner accounts. Actual losses on partner receivables could differ from those that we have historically experienced or currently anticipate and, as a result, we may need to adjust our allowances. We may not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our partners. As a result, this could cause partners to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could extend the timing of cash receipts, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business is highly subject to business cycles and risks related to the property & casualty insurance, health insurance, and life insurance industries.\n\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of Consumer Referrals to property & casualty insurance carriers, health insurance carriers and brokers, and life insurance carriers. Revenue from our insurance verticals accounted for 99.0% and 96.6% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If insurance carriers experience large or unexpected losses through the offering of insurance, these carriers may choose to decrease the amount of money they spend on customer acquisition, including with us. These insurance markets, most notably the automobile insurance industry, have historically been cyclical in nature.  These cycles are often characterized by periods of “soft” market conditions, when carriers’ loss ratios are relatively low and they tend to focus on investing to acquire customers and build market share, \n\nand “hard” market conditions, when their loss ratios are relatively high and they tend to prioritize profitability over growth and reduce their customer acquisition spending until they can obtain regulatory approval to raise premiums.  As our insurance carrier partners go through these market cycles, our Demand Partners may increase or decrease their spending on Customer Referrals on our platform.  These changes in spending may occur rapidly and without warning, and the duration of these market cycles can be difficult to predict accurately.  Reductions in spending can have a material adverse impact on our operating results, causing them to fall short of the expectations of investors and securities analysts. For example, in the third quarter of 2021, many automobile insurers began to reduce their customer acquisition spending sharply in response to higher-than-expected loss ratios resulting from higher accident severity and increased repair costs due to global supply chain issues, and those reductions continued and in many cases worsened during 2022 and 2023 before beginning to recover in 2024.  We will likely experience such insurance industry cycles again in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nThe FTC Matter could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOn February 21, 2023, we received a civil investigative demand from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding compliance with the FTC Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as they relate to the advertising, marketing, promotion, offering for sale, or sale of healthcare-related products, the collection, sale, transfer or provision to third parties of consumer data, telemarketing practices, and/or consumer privacy or data security. On October 30, 2024, following our earnings call for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we received an initial settlement demand from the staff of the FTC (FTC Staff) stating that the FTC Staff is prepared to recommend that the FTC approve the filing of a complaint against the Company for violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (\"TSR\") and the Government and Business Impersonation Rule (the “Impersonation Rule”). We are engaged in settlement discussions with the FTC Staff in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. \n\nThe FTC Staff alleges that, in connection with our lead generation and telemarketing activities, we have represented ourselves as affiliated with government entities, made misleading claims (in particular regarding health insurance products and our use of consumers’ personal information) and utilized deceptive advertising, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC Staff further alleges that we have violated the Impersonation Rule in representing ourselves to be affiliated with government entities and the TSR in connection with telemarketing activities.\n\nThe FTC Staff proposes to seek injunctive and monetary relief and civil penalties. If obtained in whole or in part, the monetary relief and penalties proposed by the FTC Staff would have an adverse, and potentially material, effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The total amount of these proposed items significantly exceeds our existing liquidity and financial resources. Any such costs above our existing resources would require the Company to seek additional capital, incur debt or otherwise take significant actions in order to satisfy the claims, and there can be no assurances that such financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the proposed injunctive terms, if obtained in whole or in part, could adversely, and potentially materially, affect our ability to operate business in our Health insurance vertical, including by restricting how we conduct our marketing activities and by requiring enhancements to our compliance program.  Our Health insurance vertical accounted for $270.3 million, or 18%, of our Transaction Value in fiscal 2024 at a 14% take rate, of which roughly two-thirds was from under-65 health insurance at a slightly higher take rate. Finally, the Company is aware of  efforts by private law firms to solicit clients in regard to potential securities class action or derivative litigation. These matters could result in us incurring additional costs and liabilities.\n\nFor more information about the FTC Matter, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and capital resources” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data--Note 8. Commitments and contingencies--FTC matter”.\n\nOur partners may negotiate with us to reduce our platform fees or switch certain transactions from Open Marketplace to Private Marketplace, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nMany of the terms of our agreements with our partners, including our platform fees, are specifically negotiated with each partner. Our partners may negotiate with us to reduce our platform fees. The outcome of such negotiations could result in terms that are less favorable to us than those contained in our existing agreements or those obtained by our competitors, which could impact our relationship with our partners and could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.  In addition, the net revenue generated from transactions in our Open Marketplace is higher than the net revenue from transactions in our Private Marketplaces.  In the past, certain of our Supply and Demand Partners have switched their transactions with each other from our Open Marketplace to a Private Marketplace once they have reached a significant level of Transaction Value, and this may occur with other Supply and Demand Partners in the future.  Such transitions may occur with minimal notice, and may cause our operating results for a given period to fail to meet our expectations or those of any analysts that cover us or investors, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall substantially.\n\n21\n\n\nDemand Partners who access our platform can attract consumers directly through their own customer acquisition strategies, including third-party online platforms and other methods of distribution, or obtain similar services from our competitors. Similarly, Supply Partners can seek to monetize high-intent consumers or maximize the value of non-converting consumers on their websites by building their own solutions or turning to other service providers, including our competitors.\n\nThe majority of our Demand Partners do not have exclusive relationships with us, and they may change the manner in which they market and distribute their products. They can attract consumers directly through their own customer acquisition strategies, including third-party online platforms and other methods of distribution, such as referral arrangements, physical storefront operations or broker agreements. Such Demand Partners also may obtain Consumer Referrals through one or more online competitors of our business. If such Demand Partners decide to compete directly with us or choose to favor one or more third-party platforms, they could cease or reduce their purchases of Consumer Referrals on our platform. In our insurance verticals, if consumers seek insurance policies directly from insurance carriers, or if insurance carrier partners seek Consumer Referrals through our competitors or cease providing us with access to their systems or information, the number of transactions by Demand Partners on our platform may decline, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nSimilarly, most of our Supply Partners do not have exclusive relationships with us, and they can seek other solutions to maximize their consumer traffic monetization, such as building their own solutions or turning to other service providers, including our competitors, in order to monetize high-intent consumers or maximize the value of non-converting consumers on their websites. Consolidation of suppliers could eventually lead to a concentration of desirable inventory on websites or networks owned by a small number of individuals or entities, which could limit the supply or impact the pricing of inventory available to us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire Consumer Referrals that meet our partners’ performance, price, and quality requirements, in which case our revenue could decline or our cost of revenue could increase.\n\nIf we fail to compete effectively against technology companies engaged in digital customer acquisition and other competitors, we could lose partners and our revenue may decline.\n\nWe operate in the broadly defined tech-enabled insurance distribution sector. Within this sector, our closest competitors are technology companies engaged in digital customer acquisition. This sector is intensely competitive, and we expect this competition to continue to increase in the future both from existing and new competitors that provide competing platforms or technology. We compete both for Demand Partners’ customer acquisition budgets and high-quality Consumer Referrals. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including volume and cost of high-quality Consumer Referrals, return on investment, technology, and client service. Our principal competitors in this space include technology companies engaged in digital customer acquisition for insurance carriers, as well as other companies including:\n\n•direct distribution companies focused on insurance products;\n\n•industry-specific portals or customer acquisition companies with insurance-focused research online destinations;\n\n•online marketing or media services providers;\n\n•major internet portals and search engine companies with online advertising platforms; and\n\n•Supply Partners with their own sales forces that sell their online Consumer Referrals directly to Demand Partners.\n\nFinding, developing, and retaining high quality Consumer Referrals on a cost-effective basis is challenging because competition for web traffic among companies engaged in digital customer acquisition, websites, and search engines, as well as competition with traditional media companies, has resulted and may continue to result in significant increases in web traffic costs, declining margins, and reductions in revenue. In addition, if we expand the scope of our services and/or served markets, we may compete with a greater number of technology companies, websites, buyers, and traditional media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition, and other areas. Internet search companies with brand recognition have significant numbers of direct sales personnel and web traffic that provide a significant competitive advantage and have a significant impact on pricing for Consumer Referrals or web traffic. Some of these companies may offer or develop more vertically targeted products that match consumers with products and services or match Consumer Referrals with buyers and, thus, compete with us more directly. The trend toward consolidation in online marketing may also affect pricing and availability of Consumer Referral inventory. Many of our current and potential competitors also have other competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger client bases, greater access to Consumer Referrals or web traffic more generally, and significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. Competition from the DTC distribution channel may affect both volume and price, and, thus, revenue, profit margins, and \n\n22\n\n\nprofitability. If we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that other technology companies engaged in digital customer acquisition deliver to partners, we could lose partners and market share, and our revenue may decline.\n\nIf we are unable to develop new offerings, achieve increased partner adoption of those offerings or penetrate new vertical markets, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur continued improvement of our product and service offerings is critical to our continued growth. Accordingly, we must continually invest resources in product, technology, and development in order to further enhance the capabilities, effectiveness and competitive differentiation of our platform, including by improving upon and expanding the tools we offer to our partners for customer acquisition cost management and optimization.\n\nAs we develop and introduce new products and services, including those incorporating or utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning and new processing of personal information, including identifiable information, they may raise new, or heighten existing, technological, security, legal and other risks and challenges, that may cause unintended consequences and may not function properly or may be misused by our clients. If we fail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to evolving client needs or expectations, or we provide new or updated products and services that exacerbate technological, security, legal or other challenges, the reputation of and demand for our platform or related offerings could decrease and our business, financial condition and operations may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, while we have historically concentrated our efforts on the property & casualty insurance, health insurance, and life insurance markets, we may in the future seek to opportunistically penetrate other vertical markets, such as consumer finance, education, and home services. In order to penetrate new vertical markets successfully, it will be necessary to develop an understanding of those new markets and the associated risks, which may require substantial investments of time and resources, and even then we may not be successful. In such event, our revenue may grow at a slower rate than we anticipate and our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent years and anticipate further growth in the future. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must continue to maintain and enhance our platform and information technology infrastructure, as well as our financial and accounting systems and controls. We must also continue to attract, train and retain a significant number of qualified information technology and other personnel, and to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate our employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our services and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nOur past growth or the past growth in our verticals or by our competitors may not be indicative of future growth, and our revenue growth rate may decline in the future.\n\nOur past growth or the past growth in our verticals or by our competitors may not be indicative of future growth, if any. We will not be able to grow as expected, or at all, if we do not accomplish the following:\n\n•maintain and expand the number of Demand and Supply Partners that use our platform;\n\n•increase the volume and quality of Consumer Referrals available on our platform;\n\n•further enhance the capabilities and effectiveness of our platform, and effectively demonstrate the value provided by our platform to current and prospective partners;\n\n•maintain the quality of our platform; and\n\n•expand our presence to new verticals.\n\nOur revenue growth rates may also be limited if we are unable to achieve high market penetration rates as we experience increased competition. If our revenue or revenue growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\n23\n\n\nIf we are unable to attract, integrate, and retain qualified employees, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to retain our key executives and management, including Steven Yi, our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, and to hire, develop, and retain other key employees, as well as our ability to plan for and manage executive succession. Our ability to expand our business depends on our being able to hire, train, and retain sufficient numbers of experienced information technology employees, as well as data analytics, product and account management, and other personnel. Our success in recruiting highly skilled and qualified employees can depend on factors outside of our control, including the strength of the general economy and local employment markets and the availability of alternative forms of employment. Experienced information technology personnel, who are critical to the success of our business, are in particularly high demand. This demand is particularly acute in the Seattle, Washington area, where our technology and engineering team is based. Competition for their talents is intense, and retaining such individuals can be difficult. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Most of our executive officers and other key employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationships with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. \n\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. Key executives and other employees have left our company to pursue other opportunities in the past, and may do so in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating our existing employees, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire businesses or technologies that we believe could complement, expand or enhance the features and functionality of our platform and our technical capabilities, broaden our service offerings or offer growth opportunities. For example, on April 1, 2022 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Customer Helper Team, LLC, a company engaged in lead generation through social media and short form video channels. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and may divert the attention of management away from operating our business and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are consummated.  Acquisitions also could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may face risks or experience difficulties in:\n\n•effectively managing the combined business following the acquisition; \n\n•implementing operations, technologies, controls, procedures, and/or policies at the acquired company;\n\n•integrating the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\n•transitioning operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\n•obtaining any required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or other strategic transaction;\n\n•cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\n•liability for activities of the acquired company, including intellectual property infringement claims, privacy issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\n•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquisition of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\n\nDepending on the condition of any company or technology we may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects and, if not successfully integrated with our organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in \n\n24\n\n\nconnection with potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, and return on assets, and our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance stockholder value, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe rely on data provided to us by our Demand Partners, our Supply Partners, and consumers to improve our technology and service offerings, and if we are unable to maintain or increase the amount of such data available to us, we may be unable to provide our Demand Partners with a bidding experience that is relevant, efficient, and effective or our Supply Partners with satisfactory revenue yields, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nOur business relies on the data provided to us by our Demand Partners, our Supply Partners, and consumers. The large amount of information we use in operating our platform is critical to the optimal functioning of our platform. If we are unable to maintain or effectively utilize the data provided to us, including data from our Demand Partners regarding consumer conversion, the value that we can provide to our partners may be reduced. In addition, the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of this data may suffer, which may lead to a negative bidding experience for Demand Partners using our platform, or decreased yields for Supply Partners using our platform, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe have made substantial investments, including time and human resources, in the development of our proprietary technology platform, which relies on consumer-provided data, third-party data, predictive modeling, and analytics engines to maximize value for our platform users. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to collect and retain sufficient data, or to improve our data technologies, to satisfy our operating needs and the needs of our partners. Failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\n\nIn addition, to the extent consumers or third parties provide our suppliers’ websites or our proprietary websites with inaccurate information or fail to provide information, the quality of Consumer Referrals offered to our Demand Partners through our platform may suffer. A decrease in quality of Consumer Referrals could lead to a reduction in use of our platform by our Demand Partners.\n\nWe depend upon internet search companies to direct a significant portion of visitors to our suppliers’ websites and our proprietary websites. Changes in search engine algorithms have in the past harmed and may in the future harm the websites’ placements in both paid and organic search result listings, which may reduce the number of visitors to our Supply Partners’ websites and our proprietary websites and as a result, cause our revenue to decline.\n\nOur success depends on our suppliers’ ability to attract online visitors to their websites and our ability to attract online visitors to our proprietary websites, and to convert them into Consumer Referrals for our partners in a cost-effective manner. We depend on internet search companies to direct a substantial share of visitors to our suppliers’ websites and our proprietary websites. Search companies offer two types of search results: organic and paid listings. Organic listings are displayed based solely on formulas designed by the search companies. Paid listings are displayed based on a combination of the buyer’s bid price for particular keywords and the search engines’ assessment of the website’s relevance and quality. If one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we or our suppliers rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us or decides to decrease its rating of the relevance and quality of our suppliers’ or our proprietary websites, our traffic acquisition cost could rise, we could lose consumers, and traffic to our suppliers’ websites and our proprietary websites could decrease, which could in turn decrease the amount and quality of Consumer Referrals made available for sale on our platform. Any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\n\nThe ability to maintain or grow the number of visitors to our suppliers’ websites and our proprietary websites from search companies is not entirely within our control. Search companies frequently revise their algorithms and changes in their algorithms have in the past caused or could in the future cause our suppliers’ websites and our proprietary websites to receive less favorable placements. There have been fluctuations in organic rankings for a number of our suppliers’ websites and some of the paid listing campaigns have also been harmed by search engine algorithmic changes. Search companies could also determine that the content of our suppliers’ websites or our proprietary websites is either not relevant or is of poor quality. \n\n In addition, search engine companies periodically change their advertising policies, or implement new policies, which can affect the placement of our paid search results in listings (or even our ability to participate in paid search result listing at all), reducing the number of visitors to our owned and operated and third-party publishers’ websites. For example, in April 2021, Google implemented a new policy requiring paid search advertisers to be licensed health insurance brokers to bid on \n\n25\n\n\nhealth insurance-related keywords, which required us to become a licensed health insurance broker in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to be able to continue bidding on such keywords. Any such new or revised policies implemented in the future, or the loss of insurance licenses in particular states, could have a material adverse impact on our or our suppliers’ ability to drive traffic to our respective websites, which could result in a smaller supply of Consumer Referrals available on our platform to our Demand Partners and thus lower revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nWe or our Supply Partners may also fail to optimally manage our paid listings, or our proprietary bid management technologies may fail, or higher bids by our competitors may increase the cost of Consumer Referrals, any of which may lead to a decrease in the number of visits to our Supply Partners’ websites or our proprietary websites. As a result, we may need to use more costly sources to replace lost visitors who could have contributed to our supply of Consumer Referrals, and such increased expense could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Even if we and our suppliers succeed in driving traffic to our respective websites, we may not be able to effectively monetize this traffic or otherwise retain users. Failure to do so could result in a smaller supply of Consumer Referrals available on our platform to our Demand Partners and thus lower revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nIf the market for digital customer acquisition services fails to continue to develop, our success may be limited, and our revenue may decrease.\n\nThe digital customer acquisition services market is relatively new and rapidly evolving, and it uses different measurements than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness. Some of our current or potential partners have little or no experience using the internet for customer acquisition purposes and have historically allocated only limited portions of their customer acquisition budgets to the internet. The adoption of digital customer acquisition, particularly by those companies that have historically relied upon traditional media for customer acquisition, requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information, and evaluating new customer acquisition technologies and services.\n\nIn addition, we may experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies that may be advising our partners. We cannot assure you that the market for digital customer acquisition services will continue to grow. If the market for digital customer acquisition services fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, the success of our business may be limited, and our revenue may stop growing or decrease.\n\nOur existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, our subsidiary QuoteLab, LLC entered into the First Amendment to the 2020 Credit Agreement (“Existing Credit Agreement”), as amended, which provides for the 2021 Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility (collectively “2021 Credit Facilities”). The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes.  The 2021 Credit Facilities will mature on July 29, 2026.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2021 Term Loan Facility was $158.5 million and our borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility was $45.0 million.  In addition, we may in the future decide to incur additional indebtedness.\n\nOur existing or future indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\n•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes;\n\n•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry, and market conditions;\n\n•subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and requiring the pledge of substantially all of our assets as collateral, that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing;\n\n•limiting our ability to plan for and respond to business opportunities or changes in our business or industry; and\n\n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\n\n26\n\n\nIn addition, our indebtedness under the 2021 Credit Facilities bears interest at a variable rate, making us vulnerable to increases in the market rate of interest. For example, interest paid on the 2021 Credit Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $13.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2023, due to higher interest rates. If the market rate of interest increases, we will have to pay additional interest on this indebtedness, which would reduce cash available for our other business needs.\n\nThe Existing Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining specific financial ratios.  These ratios are based in part on our Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.  Our ability to continue to meet these financial ratios and tests will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  During the second half of 2021, the auto insurance industry began to experience a cyclical downturn, which reduced our Consolidated EBITDA and our compliance cushion with respect to our financial covenants. In the event that, due to business conditions or other events, we are unable to continue to generate the levels of Consolidated EBITDA required to maintain compliance with such financial covenants, we may need to reduce operating costs, negotiate amendments to or waivers of the terms of such credit facilities, refinance our debt, or raise additional capital. \n\nWe may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, to pay the amounts due under our existing debt instruments. Failure to make payments or comply with other covenants under our existing or future debt instruments could result in an event of default. Upon the maturity of the 2021 Credit Facilities, or earlier if an event of default occurs and the lender accelerates the amounts due, we may need to seek additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. In such event, we may not be able to make accelerated payments, and the lender could seek to enforce security interests, if any, in the collateral securing such indebtedness, which includes or could include substantially all of our assets. In addition, the covenants and other terms of our existing or future debt instruments could interfere with our execution of our growth strategy and limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe maintain cash balances in our bank accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation.\n\nWe maintain our cash assets at commercial banks in the U.S. in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. In the event of a failure at a commercial bank where we maintain our deposits or uninsured losses on money market or other cash equivalents in which we maintain cash balances, we may incur a loss to the extent such loss exceeds the insurance limitation, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial conditions and our results of operations.\n\nOperating and growing our business may require additional capital, and if capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects may suffer.\n\nOperating and growing our business is expected to require further investments in our technology and operations. We may be presented with opportunities that we want to pursue, and unforeseen challenges may present themselves, any of which could cause us to require additional capital beyond our internally generated cash flows. At any given time, if our cash needs exceed our expectations or we experience rapid growth, we could experience strain in our cash flow, which could adversely affect our operations in the event we were unable to obtain other sources of liquidity. As described in “Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and contingencies - Litigation and other matters” (the “FTC Matter”), the FTC Staff has advised that they are recommending that the FTC pursue claims against us in connection with our business activities, primarily in the health insurance vertical. Any settlement of such claims, or a judgment in any litigation relating thereto, could require the payment of material amounts.  In such event, we may not have adequate existing resources to cover any such amounts, and we may not be able to obtain other sources of capital sufficient to cover such amounts.\n\nIf we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve debt service obligations and restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n27\n\n\nWe have incurred significant net losses in the past and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable over the long term.\n\nWe have incurred net losses in the past, and we have an accumulated deficit of $505.9 million at December 31, 2024. If we fail to maintain or grow our revenue and manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the future and not be able to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\nIf we fail to protect our brand, our ability to expand the use of our platform by Demand and Supply Partners may be adversely affected.\n\nMaintaining strong brand recognition and a reputation for delivering value to our partners is important to our business. A failure by us to protect our brand and deliver on these expectations could harm our reputation and damage our ability to attract and retain partners, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Furthermore, a failure to protect our trademarks and domain names could adversely affect our brand and make it more difficult for users to find our platform. In addition, our competitors may have more resources than we do and may spend more advertising their brands and services. Accordingly, we could be forced to incur greater expense marketing our brand in the future to preserve our position in the market and, even with such greater expense, may not be successful in doing so. Furthermore, complaints or negative publicity about our business practices, legal compliance, marketing and advertising campaigns, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, whether valid or not, could damage our reputation and brand. If we are unable to maintain or enhance client awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income or other tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate and profitability could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n•changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect;\n\n•changes in accounting and tax standards or practice;\n\n•changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and\n\n•our operating results before taxes.\n\nIn addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be subject to audits of our income, sales, and other taxes by U.S. federal, state and local taxing authorities, and foreign authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nTaxing authorities may assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, digital services tax, digital advertising tax, business tax, gross receipts tax, and other similar tax to platform and digital advertising businesses is a complex and evolving issue. Sales, use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction, and many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business. In addition, proposed or newly enacted laws regarding indirect tax could increase our compliance obligations. Any failure by us to prepare for and to comply with the reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in penalties and other sanctions, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We do not collect indirect taxes in the majority of the jurisdictions in which we have sales, and we believe that such taxes are not applicable either because our products and services are not subject to these taxes or we do not have the requisite amount of contacts with the state for the state to be able to impose these taxes. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our operating results. \n\n28\n\n\nWe have faced, and may face in the future, various indirect tax audits in various U.S. jurisdictions. Tax authorities may challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. Although we have reserved for potential payments of past tax liabilities on our financial statements, a successful assertion by one or more tax authorities could result in substantial tax liabilities in excess of such reserves as well as penalties and interest, and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may from time to time be subject to litigation, which may be extremely costly to defend, could result in substantial judgment or settlement costs or subject us to other remedies.\n\nWe have in the past and may from time to time in the future be involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, actions relating to claims of violations of laws or regulations, breach of contract, and intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation. In addition to the FTC Matter, there are other sources of litigation risk. For example, state insurance regulators have in the past and may in the future make claims that certain of our proprietary properties, particularly in our health insurance vertical, do not comply with one or more regulations governing marketing of insurance products in that state. Claims may be expensive to defend, may divert management’s time away from our operations, and may affect the availability and premiums of our liability insurance coverage, regardless of whether they are meritorious or ultimately lead to a judgment against us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully defend or resolve any current or future litigation matters, in which case those litigation matters could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nSellers, vendors, or their respective affiliates may engage in unauthorized or unlawful acts that could subject us to significant liability or cause us to lose Demand Partners and revenue.\n\nWe generate a majority of our Consumer Referrals from online media that we source directly from our Supply Partners’ websites, as well as indirectly from the affiliates of our Supply Partners. We also rely on third-party call centers and email marketers. Although we require third parties with whom we contract to agree to comply with applicable law and regulation and endeavor to monitor and enforce these requirements, we ultimately cannot control the activities of third parties with whom we directly contract or who otherwise play a role in the generation, sale or purchase of our Consumer Referrals. Therefore, our programs and requirements to ensure compliance by these direct or indirect third parties may not be successful. In the past, we have identified and taken action to address instances of noncompliance with law, regulation or our code of conduct by these third parties, and while our compliance program is designed to detect, prevent and stop such noncompliance, our compliance efforts may not be successful.\n\nSome of these third parties, vendors, and their respective affiliates are authorized to use our Demand Partners’ brands, subject to contractual restrictions. Any activity by suppliers, vendors, or their respective affiliates which violates the marketing guidelines of our Demand Partners or that our Demand Partners view as potentially damaging to their brands, whether or not permitted by our contracts with our Demand Partners, could harm our relationships and cause Demand Partners to terminate their relationship with us, resulting in a loss of revenue. Moreover, because we do not have a direct contractual relationship with the affiliates of our suppliers, we may not be able to monitor the compliance activity of such affiliates. If we are unable to cause our Supply Partners to monitor and enforce our Demand Partners’ contractual restrictions on such affiliates, our Demand Partners may terminate their relationships with us or decrease their customer acquisition budgets with us. In addition, we may also face liability for any failure of our suppliers, vendors or their respective affiliates to comply with regulatory requirements (including, for example, in connection with the FTC Matter).\n\nThe law is unsettled on the extent of liability that an advertiser has for the activities of sellers or vendors. Insurance regulations may impose liability on us and our Demand Partners for misrepresentations made by their marketing service providers. In addition, certain of our contracts impose liability on us, including indemnification obligations, for the acts of our sellers or vendors. We could be subject to costly litigation and, if we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves or in obtaining indemnity from our vendors, we could incur damages for the unauthorized or unlawful acts of sellers or vendors.\n\nBroad-based pandemics or public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nOur business has been, and may in the future be, adversely impacted by the effects of public health crises, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, contributed to higher-than-expected inflation in insurance claims costs, which drove significant reductions in P&C insurance carrier profitability, leading our P&C insurance carrier partners to reduce their customer acquisition spending. The timing and slope of a recovery in this vertical are difficult to predict. In addition, in our travel vertical, COVID-19 has led \n\n29\n\n\nto a dramatic decline in consumers shopping for travel-related products, which has led to a significant decline in our revenue from the travel vertical, and there is uncertainty about whether our business in this vertical will return to pre-pandemic levels and the timing of any such recovery. \n\nIn addition, future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other widespread diseases may occur in the future, any of which could negatively affect customer acquisition spend by our Demand Partners or on consumer insurance product search activity (and, in turn, Consumer Referral availability), or require changes to our business operations, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.\n\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, platform, the internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, any unforeseen political crises, terrorist attacks, war, political instability, or other catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. Any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could materially interfere with or prevent us from conducting our business for a period of time, which impact may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.  In addition, if insurance carriers experience large or unexpected underwriting losses due to a natural disaster or act of terrorism, these carriers may decrease the amount of money they spend on customer acquisition spending until they can obtain regulatory approval to raise premiums. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nRisks related to information security and privacy, the integrity of our platform, and our intellectual property\n\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a cybersecurity breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of our partners or third-party service providers.\n\nOur systems and those of our partners and third-party service providers could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or data of our partners or consumers, or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Our operations involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data, including personal information, and security breaches could result in the loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, litigation and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm, or otherwise materially disrupt our operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, ransomware, viruses, phishing attacks, denial of service or other attacks, breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal sources, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches. Concerns about security increase when information (including personal data) is transmitted electronically, as is the case with both our technology platform and our other information technology systems, as such transmissions can be subject to attack, interception, loss or corruption. In addition, computer viruses and malware can be distributed and spread rapidly over the internet and could infiltrate our systems or those of our buyers, sellers, and third-party service providers. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence by outside parties to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks may increase the risks of cyberattacks or data breaches. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or third-party service providers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems. Infiltration of our systems or those of our partners and third-party service providers could lead to disruptions in systems, accidental or unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of confidential or otherwise protected information (including personal data) and the corruption of data.  These risks may increase as we continue to grow and collect, process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of data. Although we are not aware of any material information security breaches to date, we have detected common types of attempts to attack our information systems and data.\n\nIf we or any of our partners or third-party service providers experience security breaches that cause interruptions to the services we provide, or the loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, it could cause partners or consumers to lose confidence and trust in us and our services, terminate data integrations with us, or stop using our platform or websites entirely, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\n30\n\n\nWe take efforts to protect our systems and data, including establishing cybersecurity policies and processes, performing risk assessments to aid in the identification and mitigation of threats, and implementing technological measures designed to provide multiple layers of security. However, it is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well as criminals’ intent on committing cyber-crime, and these efforts may not be successful in preventing, detecting, or stopping attacks. The sophistication and resources of cyber criminals and other threat actors continue to increase, and the techniques they use to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and often originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world.  As a result, we may be unable to proactively implement adequate preventative measures, to react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or to successfully implement remediation efforts. Controls employed by our information technology department and our partners and third-party service providers, including cloud vendors, could prove inadequate. We also have employees located outside of the United States, which may subject us to greater risk of cyberattacks. A breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations, as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee communications, and other functions, and we also have data integrations with certain partners, both of which may increase the risk of cybersecurity attacks and loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of consumers and employees. Third-party risks may include insufficient security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate. Although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our partners and third-party service providers, they are limited in nature and we cannot assure you that such agreements will prevent the accidental or unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of data (including personal data) or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our partners or third-party service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents.\n\nOur employees have a hybrid work schedule consisting of both in-person work and working from home. Although we have implemented work-from-home protocols, the actions of our employees while working from home may increase the risk of compromise to our systems, confidential information or data, due to factors including employees’ access and use of company networks and/or information on non-company devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\n\nAny or all of the issues above could adversely affect our ability to attract new partners and continue our relationship with existing partners, cause our partners to cancel their contracts with us or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, thereby harming our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Any accidental or unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of data, cybersecurity breach or other security incident that we or our partners could experience or the perception that one has occurred or may occur, could harm our reputation, reduce the demand for our services and disrupt our normal business operations. In addition, it may require us to spend material resources to investigate or correct the breach and to prevent future security breaches and incidents, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, expose us to legal liabilities, including litigation, regulatory enforcement, indemnity obligations or damages for contract breach, and cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any such incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. \n\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose, transfer, and use consumer information and other data, and an actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data or respect users’ privacy could damage our reputation and brand or negatively affect our ability to retain partners and harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nThe operation of our platform involves the collection, processing, storage and transmission of consumers’ information, including personal information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, investigations, regulatory fines, litigation, and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. For example, unauthorized parties could steal consumer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and other information, which we collect when providing our services.\n\n31\n\n\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, and public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause consumers and partners to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Regulatory agencies or business partners may institute more stringent data protection requirements or certifications than those which we are currently subject to and, if we cannot comply with those standards in a timely manner, we may lose the ability to maintain our platform. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put consumer or partner information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. While we have developed systems and processes to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and security of our and our partners’ data, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could fail and result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of such data. \n\nIn addition, we may be unable to halt the operations of third parties that aggregate or misappropriate our data, and such activity could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nIf we are unable to adequately obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, proprietary systems, technology and brand, our ability to compete could be harmed.\n\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, proprietary systems, technology and brand. We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and technology. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. Additionally, there is uncertainty concerning the scope of intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Despite our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient to effectively prevent unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized use of our trade secrets or other confidential information or to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights and offering similar or superior functionality. To the extent we are able to obtain enforceable intellectual property rights, such intellectual property rights may not prevent third parties from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing product and service technology offerings and services similar to or duplicative of our product and service offerings. For example, monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights can be challenging and costly and we may not be effective in policing or prosecuting such unauthorized use or disclosure.\n\nWe also may fail to maintain or be unable to obtain adequate protections for certain of our intellectual property rights in the U.S. or certain foreign countries, and our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the U.S. because of the differences in foreign patent, trademark, copyright, and other laws concerning proprietary rights. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated or held unenforceable through administrative process or litigation in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. In addition, our competitors may attempt to copy unprotected aspects of our product design or independently develop similar technology or design around our intellectual property rights. Third parties also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation or cause partner confusion through the use of similar service names or domain names. Litigation regarding any intellectual property disputes may be costly and disruptive to us. Any of these results would harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nAdditionally, we rely, in part, on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, including our partners. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets. Moreover, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products and platform capabilities. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or know-how is \n\n32\n\n\ndifficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets and know-how. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including mediaalpha.com, quotelab.com, and healthplans.com. Failure to maintain our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for current and future partners to find our website and our platform. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nWe may become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we may not be aware that our products or services are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights and such third parties may bring claims alleging such infringement, misappropriation or violation. Third parties may be able to successfully challenge, oppose, invalidate, render unenforceable, dilute, misappropriate or circumvent our trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. Additionally, companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly high profile, the possibility of receiving a larger number of intellectual property claims against us grows. In addition, various “non-practicing entities,” and other intellectual property rights holders may in the future attempt to assert intellectual property claims against us or seek to monetize the intellectual property rights they own to extract value through licensing or other settlements.\n\nAny claim of infringement or other proceeding involving our intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, against us or for which we are required to provide indemnification could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business, and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement fees, damages, royalties, or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third party’s intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our products and platform capabilities or cease business activities related to such intellectual property.\n\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or impossible to detect. Actions we may take to enforce our intellectual property rights may be expensive and divert management’s attention away from the ordinary operation of our business and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, and, if such defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits are successful, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or harm our reputation and brand, and could materially and adversely affect our brand and business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Furthermore, such enforcement actions, even if successful, may not result in an adequate remedy. In addition, many companies have the capability to dedicate greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them.\n\nAlthough we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. Further, we might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms (if at all) and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same \n\n33\n\n\ntechnology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort and expense, and may ultimately not be successful. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively. Any of these results would harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and improve the technological infrastructure that supports our platform, and any significant disruption in service on our platform could result in a loss of partners, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nOur ability to service partners depends on the reliable performance of our technological infrastructure, including the cloud computing platforms we use. Interruptions, delays or failures in these systems, whether due to our cloud computing and other vendors, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, cybersecurity attacks, physical break-ins, terrorism, errors in our software or otherwise, could be prolonged and could affect the security or availability of our platform. Our systems or those of third parties may also contain undetected errors or other performance problems or may fail due to human error. The reliability and security of our systems, and those of our partners and vendors, is important not only to maintaining our platform, but also to maintaining our reputation and ensuring the proper protection of our confidential and proprietary information. If we experience operational failures or prolonged disruptions or delays in the availability of our systems, we could lose current and potential partners, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nAny errors, defects, or disruptions in our platform or services we rely on from third parties, or other performance problems with our platform or services we rely on from third parties could harm our brand and may damage the businesses of our partners. Our online systems, including our platform, could contain undetected errors, or “bugs,” that could adversely affect their performance. Additionally, we update our platform and our other online systems. These updates may contain undetected errors when first introduced or released, which may cause disruptions in our services and may, as a result, cause us to lose current and potential partners, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, including the hosting of our platform, and any disruption of service experienced by a third-party service provider or our failure to manage and maintain existing relationships or identify other high-quality, third-party service providers could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our platform to our partners, and any disruption of, or interference with, our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) is a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We rely on AWS for the cloud computing infrastructure we use to host our platform and website, serve our users and support our operations and many of the internal tools we use to operate our business, including compute, storage, data transfer, and other functions and services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures, and other events beyond our control. We have from time to time experienced service outages in AWS’ systems and services. In the event that AWS’ systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate our platform may be impaired, which could result in us missing financial targets for a particular period. A decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could result in lengthy interruptions to our platform. All of the aforementioned risks may be exacerbated if our or AWS’ business continuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\n\nAdditionally, AWS may experience threats or attacks from computer malware, ransomware, viruses, social engineering (including phishing attacks), denial of service or other attacks, employee theft or misuse, and general hacking, which have become more prevalent in our industry. Any of these security incidents could result in unauthorized access to, damage to, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of, disclosure of, modification of, destruction of, or loss of our data or our partners’ data or disrupt our ability to provide our platform or service. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Users may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our platform to them. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS, and, even if we do switch our operations, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform to our partners, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our \n\n34\n\n\nreputation and may adversely impact the use of our platform. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.\n\nAWS does not have an obligation to renew its agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Although alternative data center providers could host our platform on a substantially similar basis to AWS, transitioning the cloud infrastructure currently hosted by AWS to alternative providers could potentially be disruptive and we could incur significant one-time costs as well as increased operating costs. If we are unable to renew our agreement with AWS on commercially reasonable terms, our agreement with AWS is prematurely terminated, or we add additional infrastructure providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center providers. If AWS or other infrastructure providers increase the costs of their services, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to, which could detrimentally impact our buyers’ advertising campaigns. Moreover, our proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms may lead to unintentional bias and discrimination.\n\nWe use proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms in our product offerings. The data that we gather from interactions with consumers is evaluated and curated by proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms. The continuous development, maintenance, and operation of our data analytics infrastructure is expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties, including material performance problems, undetected defects or errors. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms from operating properly. If our data analytics do not function reliably, this could negatively impact either the bidding experience for buyers on our platform or our ability to filter bids as part of the bid screening process or accurately predict a consumer’s buying behavior. Any of these situations could result in buyers’ dissatisfaction with us, which could cause our buyers to stop using our platform or prevent prospective buyers from using our platform. Additionally, our proprietary predictive modeling tools and machine learning algorithms may lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, which could subject us to legal or regulatory liability as well as reputational harm. Any of these eventualities could result in a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nIf the way cookies are used or shared, or if the use or transfer of cookies is restricted by third parties outside of our control or becomes subject to unfavorable legislation or regulation, our ability to develop and provide certain products or services could be affected.\n\nSmall text files (referred to as “cookies”) placed on internet browsers by certain websites are used to gather data regarding a user’s web browsing activity. For example, cookie data allows us to collect data about the websites and webpages that users may visit or to identify users on other websites who have previously visited our partners’ websites. This information helps us to recognize prior users and to gather accurate conversion data from our partners. The availability of cookie data may be limited by numerous potential factors, including general trends among internet users to refuse to accept cookies on their web browsers, web browsers blocking third-party cookies by default or otherwise transitioning away from using cookies, other laws or regulations limiting the transferability or use of information gathered using cookies, or the refusal of providers of such information to provide it to us or to provide it to us on favorable terms. If we are not able to obtain this information on the terms we anticipate, our product offerings may be affected, which may cause a reduction in revenue or a reduction in revenue growth.\n\nOur use of “open source” software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject us to possible litigation.\n\nSome of our services and technologies incorporate software licensed under so-called “open source” licenses. In addition to risks related to general license requirements, usage of “open source” software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as “open source” licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or code quality, as it is generally freely accessible, usable, and modifiable, and is made available to the general public on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. Additionally, “open source” licenses frequently require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public, and often require that modifications or derivative works to “open source” software continue to be licensed under “open source” licenses. Certain “open source” licenses mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with “open source” software, become subject to the “open source” license.\n\nFrom time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their platforms have faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. We could be subject to suits by parties \n\n35\n\n\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require users who distribute software containing open source to make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code of the user. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, or if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations, could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the operation of our platform or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects, and could help our competitors develop platforms that are similar to or better than ours.\n\nRisks related to laws and regulation\n\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, many of which are evolving.\n\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as internet communications, advertising, e-commerce, worker classification, employment, payments, worker confidentiality obligations, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, antitrust and data security are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal and state administrative agencies. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet, mobile and related technologies. Other laws and regulations may be adopted in response to internet, mobile and related technologies. New and existing laws and regulations (or changes in interpretation of existing laws and regulations) may also be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to us and other online platforms. As our platform’s scope expands, regulatory agencies or courts may claim that we, or our users, are subject to additional requirements or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in or with certain verticals or jurisdictions.  For example, in the FTC Matter, the FTC Staff asserts violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, the TSR and the Impersonation Rule. See “Risk Factors - The FTC Matter could have a material adverse effect on our business.”  It is also possible that certain provisions in agreements with our buyers, sellers, and service providers may be found to be unenforceable or not compliant with applicable law.\n\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies and technology companies in general. The effects of recently imposed and proposed governmental antitrust actions are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of such actions. Scrutiny and regulation of the technology industry may increase, which could require us to devote significant legal and other resources to addressing such scrutiny and regulation. The growth and development of the technology industry in general may prompt calls for greater enforcement of U.S. and/or state antitrust laws, which may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours. Regulatory agencies may also enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another.    \n\nLaws and regulations regulating insurance activities are complex and could negatively affect us and/or our Supply and Demand Partners, which could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business, may reduce our profitability and potentially limit our growth.\n\nThe insurance industry in the U.S. is heavily regulated. The insurance regulatory framework addresses, among other things: granting licenses to companies and agents to transact particular business activities; and regulating trade, marketing, compensation, and claims practices. In 2021, we became licensed to sell health insurance policies in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, which has subjected us to laws and regulations applicable to insurance brokers and to the authority of the insurance regulators in those jurisdictions. In addition, Medicare providers and their brokers and marketing partners are subject \n\n36\n\n\nto the regulations governing the marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, which are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), have materially changed the rules regarding how such policies are marketed, and may materially restrict our ability to sell Consumer Referrals to certain buyers in the future.\n\nThe cost of compliance with such regulations or any non-compliance could impose material costs on us and our partners and negatively affect our or their business, marketing practices, and budgets, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nFurthermore, the laws and regulations governing the sale of insurance may change in ways that adversely impact our business or those of our insurance partners. For example, CMS has recently made significant changes in the regulations regarding how Medicare plans may be marketed and sold, and may make additional changes in the future. In addition, CMS has recently proposed changes in the regulations regarding the compensation of Medicare brokers and the maximum duration of short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, These or other changes have impacted and could in the future impact the manner in which we or our partners are permitted to conduct business, which could negatively affect our and/or their marketing practices, budgets, and overall level of business with us, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nChanges and developments in the regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is subject to an evolving regulatory regime at both the federal and state levels. In recent years, there have been multiple reform efforts made within the healthcare industry in an effort to curtail healthcare costs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) and related regulatory reforms have materially changed the regulation of health insurance. While it is difficult to determine the impact of potential reforms on our future business, it is possible that such changes in industry regulation could result in reduced demand for our platform. Our insurance partners may react to existing or future reforms, or general regulatory uncertainty, by reducing their reliance on our platform. Developments of this type could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, impacting the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by certain insurance carriers. Health reform efforts and measures may expand the role of government-sponsored coverage, including single payer or “Medicare-for-All” proposals, which could have far-reaching implications for the insurance industry if enacted. We are unable to predict the full impact of healthcare reform initiatives on our operations in light of the uncertainty regarding the terms and timing of any provisions enacted and the impact of any of those provisions on various healthcare and insurance industry participants. In particular, because our platform helps connect consumers to websites and other distribution channels where they can shop for insurance policies from a panel of insurance carriers, the expansion of government-sponsored coverage through “Medicare-for-All” or the implementation of a single payer system may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and international laws, directives, and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to privacy and the collection, protection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal information and other data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) and other state privacy laws, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”), the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the TSR, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, supplemented by national laws (such as, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 2018) and further implemented through binding guidance from the European Data Protection Board. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new, or amendments to existing, legislation or regulations and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation and ensure their compliance with current laws, rules and regulations, we (and other parties with whom we do business) may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action in the U.S. if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or \n\n37\n\n\nmisrepresentative of our actual practices. Any failure by us or other parties with whom we do business to comply with this documentation or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, private parties or others (including, without limitation, the FTC Matter, where the FTC Staff has alleged that certain of our conduct and business practices violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and the TSR). In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for non-compliance are rising.\n\nIn the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. A number of federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy affect and apply to the insurance industry specifically, including those imposed by the New York Department of Financial Services. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed and may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no customer information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\n\nInternationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including, but not limited to the EU. Complying with these regulations may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in our efforts to achieve compliance either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects or others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, compliance cost, potential risk exposure, and uncertainty for these entities, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.\n\nDomestic laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted or are currently considering legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security, and data breaches. Laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also frequently amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. For example, the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain sales of personal information and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase the frequency of data breach litigation. The CCPA has already been amended multiple times, and it is unclear whether this legislation will be further modified or how it will be interpreted. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. The CCPA, CPRA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, limit our ability to collect and/or use certain types of data or otherwise require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\n\nFurther, as we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For example, the collection and storage of healthcare data by health insurance carriers subject them to compliance requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain substantial restrictions and requirements regarding the use, collection, security, storage, and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements directly upon business associates of covered entities. Health insurance carriers are covered entities under HIPAA. In the event we are deemed to be a business associate of such carriers, we may be bound by compliance obligations under HIPAA, including security breach notification obligations, and subject to increased liability as a possible liable party. In such instance, if we knowingly breach the HITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties up to $1.5 million for identical incidences and the possibility of civil litigation.\n\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party \n\n38\n\n\nproviders or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing partners from using our platform, delay planned uses, and disclosures of data or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nOur and our partners’ communications with potential and existing consumers are subject to laws regulating telephone and email marketing practices.\n\nWe and our partners make telephone calls and send emails and text messages to potential and existing consumers, which are subject to various state and federal laws regulating telemarketing communications (including SMS or text messaging), including the TCPA and TSR. In connection with the FTC Matter, the FTC Staff has alleged that we have violated the TSR.\n\nThe TCPA prohibits companies from making telemarketing calls using an automated telephone dialing system (ATDS) or artificial or prerecorded voice technology (collectively, “robocalls”), or to numbers listed in the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, and imposes other obligations and limitations on making phone calls and sending text messages to consumers, in either case without the prior consent of the consumer. The TSR prohibits robocalls unless the caller has obtained prior express written consent directly from the consumer following clear and conspicuous disclosure. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that do not comply with certain requirements, such as providing an opt-out mechanism for stopping future emails from senders. Failure of our partners to comply with these and similar laws, rules and regulations may subject us to claims by regulatory authorities and/or private plaintiffs. However, because our Supply Partners may acquire Consumer Referrals from third-party suppliers, and our Demand Partners may resell Consumer Referrals to third-party advertisers, with whom we do not have direct contractual relationships, we may not be able to monitor their compliance activity effectively. Our failure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to telephone, text message, and email marketing, or similar failures by our Supply Partners or Demand Partners (or third parties with whom they work), could subject us and them to lawsuits, fines, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, and other losses that could harm, directly or indirectly, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nThe laws and regulations governing the use of emails and telephone calls for marketing purposes continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the industry, regulatory priorities or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of additional laws or regulations or changes in the manner in which existing laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in 2023 the FTC took the position (in public statements and enforcement actions) that consent to receive robocalls under the TSR must be received directly from the consumer, rather than through a third party such as a lead generator, and it appears that the staff of the FTC continues to assert this position in relation to the FTC Matter. Any such new laws or regulations or changes in regulations could result in a reduction in the volume of leads and calls supplied to our marketplaces, or a reduction in the ability of our owned and operated lead generation websites to generate such leads and calls profitably, or increase the risk of claims made against us or our partners, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. \n\nRisks related to being a public company\n\nOur operating results or other operating metrics may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis and may not meet expectations of research analysts, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\n\nOur quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. Period to period variability or unpredictability of our results could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of any analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face litigation, including securities class actions.\n\nIn addition, if one or more analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or more analysts \n\n39\n\n\ncease to cover our Class A common stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nOur quarterly results, including the levels of our revenue, our operating expenses and other costs, and our operating metrics, may fluctuate significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. In addition, our quarterly results may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include, but are not limited to: \n\n•the timing of cyclical changes in market conditions in the P&C insurance and health insurance industries, and in the levels of customer acquisition spending by our Demand Partners; \n\n•the mix of Transaction Value in a given period from Open Marketplace and Private Marketplace transactions; \n\n•our ability to attract new Supply and Demand Partners and retain our existing Supply and Demand Partners, and to expand our business with these partners; \n\n•the timing and level of market acceptance of new platform capabilities introduced by us and our competitors; \n\n•the amount and timing of operating expenses and other costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, infrastructure and operations; \n\n•the amount and timing of operating expenses and other costs associated with assessing or entering new vertical markets; \n\n•the amount and timing of operating expenses and other costs related to the development or acquisition of businesses, technologies or intellectual property rights; \n\n•the timing and impact of security breaches, service outages or other performance problems with our technology infrastructure and software solutions; \n\n•the timing and costs associated with legal or regulatory actions or compliance with new regulations; \n\n•changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, strategic partners or customers; \n\n•loss of our executive officers or other key employees; and\n\n•general economic and market conditions. \n\nIn addition to other factors that cause our results of operations to fluctuate, our results are also subject to significant seasonal and cyclical fluctuation. Our P&C insurance vertical is typically characterized by seasonal weakness during our fourth quarter due to lower customer acquisition budgets from buyers and lower supply of Consumer Referrals during the holiday period. During our first quarter, our P&C insurance vertical typically exhibits seasonal strength as customer acquisition budgets from our buyers and Consumer Referral volume from our sellers both increase sequentially. Our health insurance vertical typically experiences seasonal strength during the fourth quarter due to a material increase in Consumer Referrals and a related increase in customer acquisition budgets in connection with the Medicare annual enrollment period, which generally runs from October 15 to December 7 each year, and the under-65 health insurance open enrollment period, which generally runs from November 1 through December 15 in many states, with the last ending on January 31st of the following year. Customer acquisition spending in our health insurance vertical is typically lower during the other quarters of the year because most consumers enroll in these plans during the annual and open enrollment periods.\n\nFluctuations in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock, regardless of whether they impact or reflect the overall performance of our business. If our quarterly results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, or below any guidance we may provide, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\n\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions may not be accurate and are subject to change.\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect or if events occur that require us to revise our previous estimates or assumptions, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n40\n\n\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which has increased and will increase our costs of operations and may divert focus from our business operations.\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, the need to maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategic initiatives and growing our business. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRisks related to internal control on financial reporting\n\nAs a public company, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our internal control over financial reporting may not be determined to be effective, or our independent registered public accountants may issue an adverse opinion on these controls, all of which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock. \n\nOn an annual basis, we are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this requirement is time-consuming, costly and complicated. If during the evaluation and testing process we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or we are unable to remediate any material weakness, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, if we fail to establish and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal controls over financial reporting are documented, designed, operating or reviewed. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. \n\nWe cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control over financial reporting, including the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting and may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we identify any material weaknesses in the future and are unable to successfully remediate any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law \n\n41\n\n\nrequirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our share price may decline as a result.\n\nRisks related to our Class A common stock\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, price and times desired.\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been highly volatile, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. Shares of technology companies have historically experienced levels of volatility that can exceed the overall market. Since shares of our Class A common stock were initially sold in the IPO in October 2020 at a price of $19.00 per share, the low and high closing sales prices of our Class A common stock ranged from $5.36 to $64.11 per share, respectively, through December 31, 2024.\n\nSome specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our Class A common stock include:\n\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or those of our competitors;\n\n•actual or anticipated changes in the growth rate of the online insurance/digital advertising market or the growth rate of our businesses or those of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\n•changes in economic or business conditions;\n\n•changes in governmental regulation and the outcome of governmental enforcement of such regulation; and\n\n•publication of research reports about us, our competitors or our industry, or changes in, or failure to meet, estimates made by securities analysts or ratings agencies of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of analyst coverage.\n\nThis volatility may be increased due to the limited trading volume in our Class A common stock. Our Class A common stock is traded on the NYSE, and despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when our Class A common stock could be considered thinly-traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing or selling our Class A common stock at or near the current market price at any given time may be relatively small.  This increases the potential for increases in the level of buying or selling interest to have a greater impact on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of our Class A common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\n\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise would dilute all other stockholders.\n\nIn the future, we may issue additional stock, including as grants of equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans, to raise additional capital through equity financings or to acquire or make investments in companies, products or technologies for which we may issue equity securities to pay for such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\n\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our Class A common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law and after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, cash flows, impact on our effective tax rate, indebtedness, contractual obligations, legal requirements, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Class A common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock by our pre-IPO stockholders in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Class A common stock to fall. \n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock by our pre-IPO stockholders, including shares issuable upon the exchange of Class B-1 units (together \n\n42\n\n\nwith an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock). The perception in the public market that our pre-IPO stockholders might sell shares of Class A common stock could also depress our market price. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 55.5 million Class A-1 units and 11.6 million Class B-1 units were outstanding. Each Class B-1 unit, together with one share of our Class B common stock, is exchangeable for one share of Class A common stock (or, at our election, cash of an equivalent value).  Substantially all of such shares may be resold at any time, subject in certain cases to compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In November 2021, pursuant to a registration rights agreement with certain of our existing investors, including White Mountains, Insignia, and the Senior Executives, we registered certain of their shares of our Class A common stock, including those delivered in exchange for Class B-1 units, for resale, of which 23.7 million shares remained registered and available for sale as of May 7, 2024. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital in the future by selling shares of our Class A common stock or other equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\n\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders’ agreement and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of MediaAlpha, Inc., which could decrease the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and stockholders’ agreement contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Among other things, these provisions:\n\n•divide our Board of Directors into three staggered classes of directors that are each elected to three-year terms;\n\n•provide the Board of Directors with the sole ability to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors;\n\n•prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\n•authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\n•prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which could otherwise allow holders of a lesser number of shares to elect director candidates;\n\n•provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, the chairman of our board, the Chief Executive Officer;\n\n•require advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees;\n\n•require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and any provision of our amended and restated bylaws;\n\n•require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock to remove directors and only for cause;\n\n•provide that each of White Mountains, Insignia and the Founders are entitled to (i) nominate two directors to the Board of Directors for so long as such stockholder owns at least 12.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the closing of our IPO and (ii) nominate one director to the Board of Directors for so long as such stockholder owns less than 12.5% but at least 5% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the closing of our IPO; and\n\n•provide that White Mountains, Insignia and the Founders agree to vote for each other’s board nominees pursuant to the terms of the stockholders’ agreement.\n\nIn addition, Section 203 of the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) may affect the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” We elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that they provide that each of White Mountains, Insignia, and the Founders and their respective affiliates and transferees are not be deemed to be “interested stockholders,” and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\n\n43\n\n\nThese and other provisions could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of our company or could make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions that you desire.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders’ agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectation to participate in certain corporate governance opportunities identified by or presented to certain of our existing investors.\n\nEach of White Mountains, Insignia, and the Founders and their respective affiliates may engage in activities similar to ours or lines of business or have an interest in the same areas of corporate opportunities as we do. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders’ agreement provide that such stockholders and their respective affiliates will not have any duty to refrain from (1) engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us, including those business activities or lines of business deemed to be competing with us, or (2) doing business with any of our clients, customers or vendors. In the event that White Mountains, Insignia or the Founders or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for us, they will have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders’ agreement also provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of such stockholders or their respective affiliates will be liable to us, for breach of any fiduciary duty or otherwise, by reason of the fact that any such stockholder or any of its affiliates directs such corporate opportunity to another person, or otherwise does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us, and we will waive and renounce any claim that such business opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects if attractive business opportunities are allocated by White Mountains, Insignia or the Founders to themselves or their respective affiliates instead of to us.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains exclusive forum provisions that may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Board of Directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, are the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine under Delaware law. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act but that the forum selection provision will not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). While the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld provisions of the certificates of incorporation of other Delaware corporations that are similar to this forum provision, and other state and Federal courts have upheld the enforceability of such forum provisions, a court of another state could decide that such provisions are not enforceable under the laws of that state. These exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find one or more of these exclusive forum provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions or forums, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. For example, under the Securities Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our Class A common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision, but will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, if a claiming party brings certain actions against us and is not successful on the merits, then it will be obligated to pay our litigation costs, which could have the effect of discouraging litigation, including claims brought by our stockholders.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, except to the extent prohibited by the DGCL, and unless our Board of Directors otherwise approves, in the event that any claiming party (a) initiates, asserts, joins, offers substantial assistance to or \n\n44\n\n\nhas a direct financial interest in a covered proceeding and (b) such claiming party does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought by such claiming party, then each such claiming party will be obligated to reimburse us and any applicable director, officer or other employee for all fees, costs, and expenses of every kind and description (including, but not limited to, all attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses) that we or any such director, officer or other employee actually incurs in connection with the covered proceeding. While application of this standard will necessarily need to take into account the particular facts, circumstances, and equities of any particular claim, we would expect a claiming party to be required to prevail on the merits on substantially all of the claims asserted in the complaint and, as a result, receive substantially the full remedy that it was seeking (including, if applicable, any equitable remedy) in order to avoid responsibility for reimbursing such fees, costs, and expenses. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in the shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This provision could have the effect of discouraging litigation against us, including claims brought by our stockholders and including claims that are partially (but not wholly) successful on the merits. However, it is currently unclear whether the Delaware legislature will take action to eliminate or limit the ability of stock corporations to implement provisions such as this, or whether Delaware courts will enforce in full a provision such as this for a Delaware stock corporation. If the Delaware legislature takes action to limit or eliminate our ability to include this provision in our amended and restated bylaws or a court were to find this provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\nDifferent interests among our investors or between our investors and us, including with respect to related party transactions, could prevent us from achieving our business goals.\n\nA majority of our Board of Directors is comprised of directors who are affiliated with White Mountains, Insignia, and the Founders. Certain of our pre-IPO stockholders could have business interests that conflict with those of the other investors, which may make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among our owners.\n\nOur relationship with our pre-IPO stockholders could create conflicts of interest among our investors, or between our investors and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. In addition, our pre-IPO stockholders may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivables agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivables agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these pre-IPO stockholders’ tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Except as set forth in the tax receivables agreement and the stockholders’ agreement, there are no formal dispute resolution procedures in place to resolve conflicts between us and our pre-IPO stockholders or among our pre-IPO stockholders. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and any pre-IPO stockholders and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party. This concentration of ownership and voting power may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our company which could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of such pre-IPO stockholders, even if such events are in the best interests of minority stockholders. Furthermore, this concentration of voting power may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock.\n\nPursuant to the stockholders’ agreement, each of White Mountains, Insignia, and the Founders is entitled to nominate one or two directors to the Board of Directors for so long as such stockholder owns at least 12.5%, in the case of two directors, or less than 12.5% but at least 5%, in the case of one director, of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the closing of our IPO.\n\nSection 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” We elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that they provide that each of White Mountains, Insignia, and the Founders and their respective affiliates and transferees are not deemed to be “interested stockholders,” and accordingly are not subject to such restrictions.\n\nIn addition, because Insignia and the Founders hold their pre-IPO economic interest in our business indirectly through QLH, rather than through MediaAlpha, Inc., these existing owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock.\n\n45\n\n\nWe are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules. However, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a one-year transition period.\n\nIn May 2024, we ceased to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. The NYSE rules require that the nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of the date that we no longer qualify as a “controlled company.” Our nominating and corporate governance committee is not currently comprised exclusively of independent directors. We will comply with this requirement prior to the end of the transition period, but until that occurs our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Furthermore, a change in our board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in our operation philosophies and deviations from our current corporate strategy.\n\nRisks related to our structure\n\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our indirect interest in QLH and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from QLH to pay taxes and other expenses.\n\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our indirect ownership of Class A-1 units. We have no independent means of generating revenue, all of which is generated by QLH’s subsidiary, QuoteLab, LLC. QLH is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its taxable income is allocated to its members, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any such income. In addition, we will continue to incur expenses related to our operations. We intend (a) to continue to cause QuoteLab, LLC to make cash distributions to its sole member, QLH, and (b) in turn to continue to cause QLH to make pro rata cash distributions, or tax distributions, to its members, including us, to (i) fund our U.S. federal, state and local tax obligations in respect of our allocable share of QLH’s taxable income and (ii) cover our obligations under the tax receivables agreement. In certain cases, QLH may also make tax distributions for a fiscal quarter to another member in respect of its pre-exchange allocable share of QLH’s taxable income for such fiscal quarter relating to Class B-1 Units (if any) transferred to us by such member (pursuant to the exchange agreement) before the applicable tax distribution date. To the extent that we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, and QLH or QuoteLab, LLC is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements, laws or regulations or does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivables agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\n\nWe are required to pay Insignia, the Senior Executives, and White Mountains for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future.\n\nIn connection with the IPO, the Secondary Offering, and in our ordinary course of business we purchased or exchanged Class B-1 units from certain unitholders. Also, in the future, Class B-1 units may be exchanged, together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock, for shares of our Class A common stock (or, at our election, cash of an equivalent value). Our initial purchase of units in the IPO, the Pre-IPO Leveraged Distribution and other actual or deemed distributions by QLH to its members, and the post-IPO exchanges of Class B-1 units may result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the assets of QLH. In connection with the IPO, we entered into the tax receivables agreement with Insignia, the Senior Executives, and White Mountains related to the tax basis step-up of the assets of QLH and certain net operating losses of Intermediate Holdco. Pursuant to the tax receivables agreement, we are required to pay Insignia and the Senior Executives 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we realize (or are deemed to realize) as a result of these possible increases in tax basis as well as certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivables agreement itself. The tax receivables agreement also requires us to pay White Mountains 85% of the amount of the cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we realize (or are deemed to realize) as a result of the utilization of the net operating losses of Intermediate Holdco attributable to periods prior to our IPO and the deduction of any imputed interest attributable to our payment obligations under the tax receivables agreement. We currently estimate that the amount of any such net operating losses is immaterial.\n\nThe payments that we may make under the tax receivables agreement could be substantial. Assuming no material changes in relevant tax law and based on our current operating plan and other assumptions, if all of the Class B-1 units were acquired by us in taxable transactions at December 31, 2024 for a price of $11.29 (which is the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2024 on the NYSE) per Class B-1 unit, we estimate that the amount that we would be required to pay under the tax receivables agreement could be approximately $164 million. The actual amount we will be required to pay under the tax receivables agreement may be materially greater than this hypothetical amount as potential future \n\n46\n\n\npayments will vary depending on a number of factors, including the timing of the exchanges, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchanges, the amount, character, and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable. Payments under the tax receivables agreement are not conditioned on Insignia’s, the Senior Executives’, or White Mountains’ continued ownership of any of our equity. Based on our recent history of pre-tax losses, the Company does not believe it will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the related tax benefits in the foreseeable future and therefore will not be required to make any payments under the tax receivables agreement, except that as of December 31, 2024, we recorded $7.0 million of estimated payments related to the 2024 tax year due under the TRA as these payments are probable and payable during the first quarter of 2026.\n\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Insignia, the Senior Executives, or White Mountains under the tax receivables agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed. As a result, we could make payments under the tax receivables agreement in excess of our cash tax savings that we ultimately realize. We might not determine whether we have effectively made such excess cash payments for a number of years following the time of such payments.\n\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from our purchase (through Intermediate Holdco) of Class B-1 units from certain unitholders in connection with the IPO, the Pre-IPO Leveraged Distribution and other actual or deemed distributions by QLH to its members, post-IPO exchanges of Class B-1 units,  the utilization of pre-IPO net operating losses of Intermediate Holdco, and payments made under the tax receivables agreement.\n\nOur ability to realize the tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of (i) the increases in tax basis created by our purchase (through Intermediate Holdco) of Class B-1 units from certain unitholders in connection with the IPO, or by any post-IPO exchanges of Class B-1 units, in each case, together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock, for shares of our Class A common stock (or, at our election, cash of an equivalent value), (ii) the Pre-IPO Leveraged Distribution and other actual or deemed distributions by QLH to its members that result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of QLH, (iii) payments made pursuant to the tax receivables agreement, (iv) our ability to utilize the pre-IPO net operating losses of Intermediate Holdco, and (v) our ability to utilize the interest deductions imputed under the tax receivables agreement all depend on a number of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income is insufficient or there are adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be negatively affected.\n\nIn certain cases, payments by us under the tax receivables agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed the tax benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivables agreement.\n\nThe tax receivables agreement provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivables agreement or are in material breach of our obligations under the tax receivables agreement, we will be required to make immediate payments to the tax receivables agreement’s counterparties equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits. Such payments would be based on certain valuation assumptions and deemed events set forth in the tax receivables agreement, including the assumption that we have sufficient taxable income to fully use such tax benefits. The benefits would be payable even though, in certain circumstances, no Class B-1 units have actually been exchanged and no net operating losses are actually used at the time of the accelerated payments. Accordingly, payments under the tax receivables agreement may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the benefits we eventually realize. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivables agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.\n\nWe may not be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivables agreement and any indebtedness we incur may limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us to pay these obligations. In addition, our obligations under the tax receivables agreement could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control that could be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.",
