      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\nGeneral\n\nPriceSmart was founded in 1996 by Sol and Robert Price, the creators of Price Club, the original warehouse club operator. The mission of PriceSmart is to operate its warehouse club business in Central America, the Caribbean and South America at operating standards as good as, or superior to, warehouse club operations in the United States.\n\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had 56 warehouse clubs in operation in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. In addition, we are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we believe is a promising new market for our business model. We believe PriceSmart has become one of the most respected and trusted brands in the countries where we operate and with over two million membership accounts, and almost four million cardholders, we believe PriceSmart is an essential part of the shopping experience for consumers and small businesses in PriceSmart’s markets.\n\nPriceSmart sources approximately half of its merchandise from suppliers within Latin America and the Caribbean, with the balance of merchandise sourced throughout the rest of the world. Product selection includes basic consumable merchandise for consumers and businesses, “Member’s Selection®” private label merchandise and consumable and non-consumable products that are often not otherwise available in our markets.\n\nPriceSmart continually focuses on innovation. In recent years, PriceSmart has added optical, audiology, and pharmacy services in many of its locations. Beyond in-club shopping, our Members can shop via our mobile app or online at PriceSmart.com, both of which offer home delivery and curbside pickup via its Click & Go® service. PriceSmart is making significant investments in technology to both improve the digital shopping experience for its Members and to enhance operating efficiencies in its supply chain and the back office.\n\nWe seek to be an outstanding place to work and provide safe and pleasant working environments for our over 12,000 employees, along with excellent pay and benefits, including healthcare coverage and retirement benefits. \n\nPriceSmart is committed to improving the quality of life for people living in the communities in which it does business. In partnership with Price Philanthropies Foundation, PriceSmart provides school supplies to approximately 140,000 children, and eye exams to thousands of children through the Aprender y Crecer program. In addition, the PriceSmart Foundation makes grants to support youth workforce development and small business growth in PriceSmart markets.\n\nWe believe that operating our business at the highest standards, providing outstanding jobs for our employees and being good stewards of the communities in which we operate result in PriceSmart being a good investment for our stockholders.\n\nThe number of warehouse clubs for each country or territory were as follows:\n\nCountry/Territory (1)\n\nNumber of\n\nWarehouse Clubs \n\nin Operation as of August 31, 2024\n\nNumber of\n\nWarehouse Clubs \n\nin Operation as of August 31, 2025\n\nAnticipated Warehouse Club Openings in Fiscal Year 2026\n\nAnticipated Warehouse Club Openings in Fiscal Year 2027\n\nColombia1010——\n\nCosta Rica89——\n\nPanama77——\n\nGuatemala67——\n\nDominican Republic551—\n\nTrinidad44——\n\nEl Salvador44——\n\nHonduras33——\n\nNicaragua22——\n\nJamaica2211\n\nAruba11——\n\nBarbados11——\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands11——\n\nTotals545621\n\n(1)In July 2025, the Company announced its plans to expand into Chile. \n\nOur member-facing warehouse clubs are all located in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our distribution centers, including two regional distribution centers, which are located in the United States (Miami) and Costa Rica, operate in conjunction with our local distribution centers in all of our multi-club markets throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and support service center offices are located in the United States. Lastly, we have additional support service centers in some of our markets. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. \n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we purchased land for our sixth warehouse club in the Dominican Republic, located in La Romana, approximately 73 miles east from the nearest club in the capital of Santo Domingo. The club will be built on a five-acre property and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2026. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we purchased land for our third warehouse club in Jamaica, located in Montego Bay, approximately 100 miles west from the nearest club in the capital of Kingston. The club will be built on a five-acre property and is anticipated to open in the summer of 2026.\n\nAdditionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we executed a land lease for our fourth warehouse club in Jamaica, located on South Camp Road, approximately six miles southeast from the nearest club in the capital of Kingston. The club will be built on a three-acre property and is anticipated to open in the fall of 2026.\n\nOnce these three new clubs are open, we will operate 59 warehouse clubs in total. \n\nWe continue to pursue opportunities to add new warehouse clubs in our existing markets and to assess opportunities in new markets. We are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we have identified as a potential market for multiple PriceSmart warehouse clubs. As part of this initiative, we have appointed a country general manager and entered into an executory agreement for a potential site for a new warehouse club in Chile. We have hired local consultants to help us in this process. However, opening PriceSmart warehouse clubs in Chile remains subject to our finding appropriate sites for warehouse clubs and distribution facilities, the results of our continuing market analyses and the receipt of required governmental permits, among other uncertainties.\n\nWe also historically exported products to a retailer in the Philippines, but effective August 31, 2024, our business relationship with that retailer ceased, except for $11.9 million of outstanding merchandise orders fulfilled during fiscal year 2025. We recently began exporting to a retailer in the Bahamas and may export to other countries if opportunities that complement our business model arise. \n\nMerchandising \n\nA fundamental part of our value proposition is making available to our retail and business Members a selection of high-quality merchandise and services sourced within our region and from around the world, at lower prices than our competitors.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n•Consumables, consisting primarily of groceries, cleaning supplies, and health and beauty aids, representing approximately 47% of our net merchandise sales;\n\n•Fresh Foods, including meat, produce, deli, seafood and poultry, representing approximately 31% of our net merchandise sales; \n\n•Hardlines, including electronics, large and small appliances, automotive, hardware, sporting goods, and seasonal products, representing approximately 11% of our net merchandise sales; \n\n•Softlines, including clothing, domestics and home furnishing products, representing approximately 6% of our net merchandise sales;\n\n•Food Service and Bakery, representing approximately 4% of our net merchandise sales; and \n\n•Health Services, including optical, audiology and pharmacy, representing approximately 1% of our net merchandise sales.\n\nCompetitive Strengths\n\nLow Operating Costs. Our club format is designed to move merchandise from suppliers to PriceSmart Members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution by minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also have opened distribution centers in all of our multi-club markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rate, reduce lead times on high volume products, and mitigate risks of supply chain disruption. Our focus on lowering operating costs helps us provide better value and lower prices to our Members, which we believe helps generate Member loyalty and renewals, which in turn leads to increased sales. \n\nMembership. Our membership provides a competitive advantage. Membership targets a desirable demographic with strong purchasing power. Data we can access about our Members not only provides better connectivity with our Members, but also enables us to identify and pursue additional opportunities to provide value for our Members. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry, beginning over 49 years ago at Price Club, the first membership warehouse club business. We believe membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership fees contribute to our ability to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers. Membership fees were equal to approximately 1.7% of net merchandise sales and 36.8% of operating income in fiscal year 2025. Our Members can sign up for and renew their memberships online, which gives us another valuable digital touch point with them.\n\nWe continue to expand our product and services offerings to our Members. One of our primary initiatives is the expansion of our wellness services, which include our optical, pharmacy and audiology departments. As of August 31, 2025, we had 55 optical locations, 22 pharmacies and 30 audiology locations open. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to enhance the value of our membership further in various areas. We continue to explore opportunities to provide our Members with products and services that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base.\n\nBusiness Members. Our product selection, larger pack sizes, and low prices appeal to both business and retail consumers. Business Members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions, and other businesses that purchase products for resale and supplies used in their businesses. These Business Members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.\n\nWorldwide Sourcing. Approximately 49% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and Europe. We believe one of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our local competitors is our buying team, based both in the United States and in our markets, which sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world. Our buyers identify and purchase new and exciting items, including our own “Member’s Selection®” private label products. Many of these products are available only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate. \n\n3\n\n\nContinuous Improvement. The warehouse club industry has been operating for over 49 years, following the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has evolved during this period, particularly with respect to how technology impacts operational efficiencies and how consumers shop. We are leveraging technology to enhance our buying process to more efficiently source merchandise and procure products in a manner that meets current and ever-evolving member preferences. We operate in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, distribution and logistical challenges and Member preferences that require us to source the correct mix of local and imported merchandise. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future Members. We also have improved our inbound and outbound online communication channels, and we are using data analytics to better understand our Members’ evolving preferences. \n\nGrowth\n\nAs we look to the future, our Company is focused on three major drivers of growth:\n\n•Invest in Adding New PriceSmart Locations, Expanding into New Markets, Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs and Opening More Distribution Centers\n\n•Increase Membership Value\n\n•Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Digital and Technological Capabilities\n\nI.Invest in Adding New PriceSmart Locations, Expanding into New Markets, Remodeling Current PriceSmart Clubs and Opening More Distribution Centers. We continue to pursue opportunities to add new warehouse clubs in our existing markets and to assess opportunities in new markets. We have acquired land for two new warehouse clubs and entered into a land lease for a third new warehouse club. These warehouse clubs will be our sixth warehouse club in the Dominican Republic and our third and fourth warehouse clubs in Jamaica. Once these three new clubs are open, PriceSmart will operate 59 warehouse clubs in total. In addition to continued growth throughout our current markets, we are continuing to advance our planned expansion into Chile, which we have identified as a potential market for multiple PriceSmart warehouse clubs. As part of this initiative, we have hired local consultants to assist us, appointed a country general manager, entered into an executory agreement for a potential site for a new warehouse club in Chile and are actively reviewing other potential sites. Additionally, we believe that one of the quickest and most effective ways to increase sales and profitability is to increase the size and efficiency of our existing warehouse clubs and the number of parking spaces at our high-volume locations. To support this strategy, we will begin warehouse club and parking lot expansions and remodels in fiscal year 2026 at select clubs. During fiscal year 2024, we entered into a lease agreement to relocate and extend the lease term for our Miraflores club, which is our highest selling location in Guatemala. The new warehouse will have increased sales floor square footage and a greater number of parking spaces, along with covered parking for our Members. We expect to relocate our Miraflores club to this new location in the first half of calendar year 2027. We are enhancing our distribution and logistics network through the opening of distribution centers in China and in each of our multi-club markets, either operated by PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We anticipate full implementation of these distribution centers in China in the first half of fiscal year 2026. We expect to reduce landed costs and lead times (via direct shipments from Asia to our local markets) and improve our working capital as a result. In addition to our regional distribution center in Costa Rica, we have PriceSmart-operated distribution centers in various stages of development and implementation in other key markets. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we adapted our distribution center in Panama to handle cold merchandise and began operation of a new dry distribution center in Guatemala. In fiscal year 2026, we plan to open PriceSmart-run distribution centers in Trinidad and Dominican Republic. \n\n4\n\n\nII.Increase Membership Value. At PriceSmart, we are dedicated to attracting new Members and fostering long-term loyalty by continually enhancing the value of membership. In addition to providing low prices on merchandise, we seek to provide Members with greater convenience and an expanding range of services. This includes access to PriceSmart.com for online shopping, seamless club pickup and delivery services, and our comprehensive Well-being initiative. Members enjoy optical services with free eye exams, affordably priced eyeglass frames, audiology services with hearing tests, and competitively priced hearing aids. In select markets, pharmacy services further enrich the PriceSmart membership experience. We increased the membership fee by $5 in all but one market during fiscal year 2024 and may consider further adjustments as member benefits and value continue to grow. A larger membership base and higher membership fee contribute to the bottom line of the business or can be reinvested in providing better pricing to our Members. We focus on growth of our membership base, Member renewal rates and average ticket as part of determining how Members see the value we offer. A key driver of our membership strategy is the Platinum Membership, which is designed to offer even more value to our most engaged Members. Platinum Members enjoy exclusive benefits, including an annual cashback reward on eligible purchases, which directly translates to savings that reward loyalty and increase purchasing power. By offering tangible financial rewards, we believe Members can derive maximum value from their membership, particularly when paired with the PriceSmart co-branded credit card which offers an additional cash back incentive for Members with the card. Platinum Members tend to demonstrate higher renewal rates and increased spending compared to other membership tiers. Platinum Membership accounts were 17.9% of our total membership base as of August 31, 2025, an increase from 12.3% as of August 31, 2024. Additionally, our private-label products that we sell under the Member’s Selection® brand plays a crucial role in enhancing the membership value proposition. We believe these products, available only at PriceSmart, deliver superior value while maintaining the high standards that our Members expect. Sourced with care and designed to meet daily needs, Member’s Selection® products range from pantry staples to household essentials, providing affordable alternatives without compromising on quality. In fiscal year 2025, our private label sales represented 28.1% of total merchandise sales, up from 27.6% for fiscal year 2024, and we plan to continue to invest in the development of additional private label products under the “Member’s Selection®” brand. By continuously enhancing our benefits and maintaining a strong focus on membership growth, renewal rates, and Member spending, we provide our Members with unmatched value, no matter how, when or where they choose to shop. As PriceSmart continues to grow, we look forward to reinvesting in new benefits and services that enhance the Member experience, creating a mutually beneficial relationship built on trust, value, and innovation.\n\nIII.Drive Incremental Sales via PriceSmart.com and Enhanced Digital and Technological Capabilities. We’ve continued to tailor our digital experience to try to exceed our Members expectations of how, when and where they want to shop. In fiscal year 2025, our digital channel sales reached $306.7 million, a 21.6% increase year-over-year, representing 6.0% of total net merchandise sales. We’re also modernizing our processes and technology. For example, we made substantial progress in our migration to the RELEX platform in fiscal year 2025, and we expect to complete our implementation in fiscal year 2026. We believe this upgrade enhances employee productivity and is designed to improve inventory management, reduce spoilage and increase in-stock availability, driving both sales and efficiency. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect to finalize implementing a new point-of-sale system, Elera, a Toshiba product, in all of our English-speaking markets in the Caribbean, and in fiscal year 2026 we will begin implementation in our Spanish speaking Central American markets. We believe with Elera we can achieve faster checkout times, improve employee productivity and enhance our payment option capabilities. Lastly, during fiscal year 2026, we will begin migrating our mobile application to fully native iOS and Android architectures to enhance speed, reliability, and accessibility for our Members. We believe this will shorten the release cycles and deepen integration with our composable commerce stack. Solidifying our foundation and allowing for faster deployment of new features will help us achieve our mission of delivery of an outstanding shopping experience while leveraging costs down.\n\nDistribution Efficiency \n\nWe have always believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our traditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online. Because PriceSmart sources merchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries where infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as developed as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more significant for us. Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our Members is key to the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we can price our products for our Members.\n\n5\n\n\nHistorically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have generally shipped their products to our Miami distribution facility, which operates within a Free Trade Zone, where the products are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our locations. Regional and in-country suppliers have shipped directly to our locations. As our location sales volumes have grown, we have routed more products from international, regional and local suppliers to regional and local distribution centers in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply, reduce logistics costs and improve working capital. \n\nIn addition to our Miami distribution facility, we have a large regional distribution center located in the metropolitan area of San Jose, Costa Rica. This 165,000 square foot facility distributes both dry and refrigerated products primarily to PriceSmart clubs in Costa Rica and also ships some products to other clubs in Central America. In Panama City, Panama we have an approximately 120,000 square foot leased building that serves as a distribution center for our warehouse clubs in Panama. This distribution center operates in a similar way to our distribution center in Costa Rica. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we adapted our distribution center in Panama to handle cold merchandise and began operations of a dry distribution center in Guatemala. In fiscal year 2026, we plan to open PriceSmart operated distribution centers in Trinidad and Dominican Republic. In the majority of our markets, we use distribution centers run by a third party. These distribution centers are part of our strategy to streamline a portion of our logistics network and, together with our plans to implement origin consolidation, we believe we will be able to lower freight costs, reduce transit time, and improve working capital by accelerating our sales conversion cycle. In addition, we are enhancing our distribution and logistics network through the opening of distribution centers in China and in each of our multi-club markets, either operated by PriceSmart or through the use of third-party logistics providers. We anticipate full implementation of our distribution center in China starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.   \n\nPriceSmart's Membership Policy\n\nWe offer three types of memberships: Diamond, Business and Platinum.\n\nThe Diamond Membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond Membership (entitling Members to two cards), in most markets as of August 31, 2025 was approximately $40 (excluding tax).\n\nThe Company currently offers the Platinum Membership program in all thirteen of its markets, which entitles Members to two cards. The annual fee for a Platinum Membership in most markets is approximately $80 (excluding tax). The Platinum Membership provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500. Platinum Members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period. The rebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31. Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue.\n\nWe promote our Business and Business Platinum Memberships by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. In most markets, our Business Members pay an annual membership fee of approximately $40, or approximately $80 for Business Platinum, for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 or $15 for additional add-on membership cards based on membership type. Only businesses can qualify for a Business Membership, which permits up to three additional members.\n\nMembers can sign-up and renew their memberships as well as choose auto-renewal online.\n\nWe recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership. Deferred membership income was $41.7 million and $36.2 million as of August 31, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Our membership agreements provide that if our Members cancel their membership in the first 60 days, they will receive a full refund. After the initial 60-day period, Members may receive a refund for the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.\n\nOur Intellectual Property Rights\n\nIt is our policy to obtain appropriate intellectual property rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We also rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know-how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation.\n\n6\n\n\nOur Competition\n\nOur international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, shopping convenience and the overall shopping experience we offer. Some of our competitors have greater resources, buying power and name recognition. In the countries in which we operate and in Chile, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, cash and carry outlets, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart, Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito in Colombia and Cencosud in South America. We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format. It is possible that additional warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with a similar warehouse club format. We also face competition from online retailers, such as AmazonGlobal and Mercado Libre in South America, and last-mile delivery services that serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future. Lastly, we face competition from wholesalers selling food and/or general merchandise, which more directly competes with our business-to-business sales.\n\n7\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had over 12,000 employees. Approximately 96% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and about 1,750 employees were represented by labor unions.\n\nDeveloping a Diverse Workforce Representative of Our Markets\n\nAt the heart of our mission is the conviction that our success depends on people, their talent, their diversity, and their ability to thrive. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce that reflects the rich cultural and social fabric of the countries in which we operate. By drawing talent from local communities where we operate, we not only create meaningful opportunities, but also gain deeper insight into each country’s operating environment and legal framework which we believe allows us to serve our Members with even greater relevance and impact.\n\nWe are a “People First Company”, and we believe our employees are our greatest strength. We believe we provide our employees with competitive wages paired with comprehensive benefits programs that often include health and life insurance, as well as long-term savings and retirement plans. These offerings strengthen financial security and well-being for our employees and their families.\n\nOur commitment extends beyond our workforce. We believe volunteering opportunities help build camaraderie and promote teamwork. We actively seek opportunities to support local businesses and contribute to the vitality of the communities around us. In doing so, we aim to elevate the quality of life where we operate, ensuring that our presence creates lasting, positive impact—economically, socially, and environmentally. During fiscal year 2025, our teams achieved almost 12,000 hours of volunteering, having surpassed our goal of 8,000 hours. Our volunteer engagements consisted of various programs that reflected a strong focus on education and community support activities such as back-to-school programs, book delivery programs, and cleaning activities such as beach, park, and river clean-ups in our communities. Our teams also invested significant time in working with children and youth programs, vision programs, and food bank support. These various programs highlight a strong alignment with education, environmental care, and community well-being as the primary areas of volunteer impact.\n\nTalent Development and Learning\n\nOur commitment to developing human capital goes beyond formal training programs. We focus on creating career paths that empower employees at all levels to see and achieve long-term growth within PriceSmart. By investing in internal mobility and succession planning, we believe we foster a culture of opportunity and advancement, ensuring continuity and resilience in our leadership pipeline. In fiscal year 2025, we conducted more than 2,100 corporate talent development sessions, including general leadership training. We provided specialized training to over 2,500 employees on developing a “Member-centric mindset,” along with courses on emotional intelligence and overcoming unconscious bias. Additionally, we offer a wide range of courses in technical and language skills, as well as wellness programs, including more than 3,900 meditation sessions through the Calm App, which is provided to our employees at no cost. We also delivered valuable “life tools,” such as workplace suicide prevention, women’s wellbeing and menopause, neurodiversity awareness, self-awareness, and fostering a growth mindset within teams, with over 5,000 total participant engagements throughout the year.\n\nWe also recognize that fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace is critical to sustaining innovation and engagement. Our goal is to ensure that every employee has equal access to the resources and opportunities needed to thrive.\n\nImportantly, we believe that employee well-being serves as the foundation for performance. Beyond competitive compensation and benefits, our wellness initiatives encompass physical and mental health resources, financial well-being programs, and family support services, reinforcing our holistic approach to caring for our people. By creating a positive, supportive environment, we believe we enable our teams to bring their full potential to work each day, which ultimately strengthens the value we deliver to our Members.\n\nThrough these investments in our people, including training, career growth, wellbeing, and inclusion, we believe we are laying the groundwork for sustained organizational excellence. We believe our human capital strategy not only drives operational efficiency and service quality but also deepens employee engagement and loyalty, positioning PriceSmart for long-term success.\n\n8\n\n\nEngaging Our Team through Internal Events – Diversity & Inclusion\n\nEach month, we organize a variety of activities in the countries in which we operate, including celebrating birthdays and work anniversaries, volunteering, recognizing employees, health and wellness events, and recreational activities like Sports Day and 5K runs. We also send company-wide messages to highlight events that honor diversity and cultural heritage and to educate team members about their history and importance.\n\nWe also recognize the role of communication and transparency in employee engagement. Regular town halls in every country, leadership forums, and digital communications serve both to celebrate company milestones and to provide forums for employees to voice their ideas and perspectives. These exchanges not only strengthen the sense of community across our geographically dispersed teams but also enable leadership to remain closely connected to employee experiences on the ground.\n\nThe activities we facilitate do more than bring employees together. They create platforms for celebrating our diversity, enriching our experiences, and fueling our shared journey toward success. In addition to promoting knowledge sharing, we believe they empower our employees to grow personally and professionally, fostering an inclusive environment where we celebrate unique perspectives and strengthen our organizational culture.\n\nIn addition to these engagement activities, in fiscal year 2025, we launched the program “Women@PSMT” to support the advancement of women in their careers. We had eight chapters consisting of different topics, over 100 sessions, and almost 9,000 total participant engagements from November to August. This program plays an important role in raising awareness, promoting inclusive practices, and ensuring that our female employees feel seen, heard, and valued. Through these efforts, we aim to foster a culture of respect and equity, where every individual can bring their authentic self to work and contribute fully to our mission.\n\nWe believe that strong engagement is directly linked to performance, innovation, and retention. By creating inclusive opportunities for connection—whether through cultural celebrations, professional development forums, or wellness activities—we believe we foster collaboration and ensure that our employees feel meaningfully connected to both one another and to the company’s long-term vision.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to expand these initiatives in line with our broader human capital and environmental and social responsibility strategies. Our goal is to cultivate an organizational culture that celebrates diversity, encourages engagement, supports overall well-being, and ensures every employee has the opportunity to thrive and develop at PriceSmart. In doing so, we believe we not only strengthen our workforce but also enhance the value we provide to our Members and local communities.\n\nSeasonality\n\nHistorically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix, and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable.  Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.\n\nOther Information\n\nPriceSmart, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1994.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nIn evaluating the Company’s business, you should consider the following discussion of risk factors, in addition to other information contained in this report and in the Company’s other public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. However, the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. \n\nExternal Factors that Could Adversely Affect Us\n\nOur financial performance is dependent on international operations, which exposes us to various risks.\n\nOur international operations account for nearly all of our total revenues. Our financial performance is subject to risks inherent in operating and expanding our international membership warehouse club business, which include:\n\n•changes in, and inconsistent enforcement of, laws and regulations, including those related to tariffs and taxes;\n\n•the imposition of foreign and domestic governmental controls, including expropriation risks;\n\n•natural disasters; \n\n•trade restrictions, including import-export quotas and general restrictions on importation;\n\n•difficulty and costs associated with international sales and the administration of an international merchandising business;\n\n•crime and security concerns that can adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we operate and which require us to incur additional costs to provide additional security at our warehouse clubs;\n\n•political instability, such as civil unrest in Panama during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 and in Colombia in 2022 and 2021 as well as anti-government protests in Panama and Guatemala in 2023; \n\n•product registration, permitting and regulatory compliance; \n\n•volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; \n\n•limitations on our ability to convert foreign currencies;\n\n•general economic and business conditions;\n\n•pandemics; and\n\n•interruption of our supply chain.\n\nThese risks may result in disruption to our sales, banking transactions, operations and merchandise shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from our non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. From time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. This illiquidity also increases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. For more information about foreign currency exchange rate risks and risks associated with the lack of U.S. dollar availability, see \"Financial and Accounting Risks – We are subject to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\"  \n\nPolitical and other factors in each of our markets may have significant effects on our business. For example, protestors set up roadblocks in Panama during October and November 2023 as a reaction to an agreement between the Panamanian government and a mining company, disrupting traffic to our clubs throughout most of the market. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Panama once again experienced widespread protests and social unrest against the government. Roadblocks in Guatemala in October 2023 related to election protests also limited access to certain of our warehouse clubs. Civil unrest in Colombia in response to tax reform and austerity measures paralyzed significant portions of the country’s infrastructure during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.\n\nNegative economic conditions created or exacerbated by inflation and higher interest rates could adversely impact our business in various respects.\n\nA slowdown in the economies of one or more of the countries in which we operate or adverse changes in economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell, change the mix of products we sell to a mix with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales or result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory. \n\nSales of food and groceries are especially sensitive to general changes in economic conditions. Economic conditions in our markets can be adversely affected by contractions in financial markets, increased governmental ownership or regulation of the economy, higher interest rates, high rates of inflation or deflation, higher fuel prices, increased barriers to entry such as higher tariffs and taxes, and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us.\n\nWe are vulnerable to changes in political and economic conditions, including the effects of tariffs and/or international trade wars and disruptions to remittances.\n\nThe U.S. government has implemented significant tariff measures, including a baseline tariff of 10% on products from all countries and higher rates targeting specific countries such as China, Vietnam, and the European Union. The U.S. and/or countries into which we import merchandise and equipment may, in the future, adjust and/or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or reciprocal tariffs or other restrictions which may affect our operations and our ability to supply merchandise at reasonable prices at our warehouse clubs. This might result in our having to increase prices to our Members to maintain our target margins or our not being able to obtain sufficient supplies of certain products, either of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The ultimate impact of any tariffs will depend on various factors, including how long such tariffs remain in place, the ultimate levels of such tariffs and how other countries respond to the U.S. tariffs. Our Miami Distribution Center, which operates within a Free Trade Zone (\"FTZ\"), helps us avoid some of the economic risks posed by U.S. tariffs, but the use of the FTZ does not fully mitigate the impact of duties on items we purchase from U.S. vendors that are either imported finished goods or that contain significant amounts of imported inputs. We may also choose to re-route merchandise directly from the country of origin directly to the markets where we have warehouse clubs to bypass the impact of U.S. tariffs. However, if we are unable to mitigate tariff-related risks through supply chain adjustments, pricing strategies, or other measures, our financial performance and growth prospects could be negatively affected.\n\nRemittances make up a significant portion of GDP in certain markets, including Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker located in the United States to an individual or family in his or her home country. If deportations of foreign workers from the United States increases, either due to changes in immigration policy, enforcement actions, or legal challenges, it could result in fewer remittances. Additionally, the financial strain of relocation and reintegration of these workers in their home countries may further diminish their disposable income and their ability to provide financial support. A decline in remittance flows could have a direct negative impact on the economies of several of the Latin American nations where we operate, which rely on remittances as a key source of income and poverty alleviation for millions of families. Starting in January 2026, the U.S. government will impose a 1% tax on anyone sending money abroad. With no minimum transaction limit, even small transfers may be taxed, meaning that this tax could reduce net remittances received in our markets from the U.S.\n\nOur profitability is vulnerable to cost increases.\n\nFuture increases in costs, such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefits costs, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs, utilities and other store occupancy costs, may reduce our profitability. We seek to adjust our product sales pricing, operate more efficiently, and increase our comparable store net sales to help offset inflation as well as currency rate changes, changes in tax rates or in the methods used to calculate or collect taxes on our sales or income and other factors that can increase costs. We might not be able to adjust prices, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future to a great enough extent to offset increased costs. Although we have seen recent inflationary pressures subsiding, substantial product cost increases and commodity price increases have and could continue to impact our financial results and could lead to reduced sales, fewer units sold, and/or margin pressure. Please see Part II. “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of the effect of currency rate changes, inflation and other economic factors on our operations.\n\nWe face significant competition.\n\nOur international warehouse club business competes with exporters, importers, wholesalers, local retailers and trading companies in various international markets. Some of our competitors have greater resources, buying power and name recognition than we have. We also face competition from online retailers who serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.\n\nIn the countries in which we operate and in Chile, we do not currently face direct competition from membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry outlets, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito in Colombia and Cencosud in South America. We have noted that certain retailers are making investments in upgrading their locations or opening new stores which may result in increased competition. Further, it is possible that other warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. Our ability to operate profitably in our markets, particularly small markets, may be adversely affected by the existence or entry of competing warehouse clubs or discount retailers.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the value and prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to Members, location, store hours, safety protocols and the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer. We may be required to implement price reductions to remain competitive if any of our competitors reduce prices in any of our markets. In response to the increasing threat associated with online retailers, we are making technology investments, which may result in increases in the use of cash and reduced profitability in the near term.\n\nOur sales could be adversely affected if one or more major international online retailers were to enter our markets or if other competitors were to offer a superior online experience.\n\nAlthough online sales are currently a smaller proportion of total sales in our markets for the types of merchandise we offer than in the U.S., online shopping is becoming more prevalent in our markets as we and our competitors begin to offer more opportunities for online shopping and as delivery systems in our markets improve. While major international online retailers have not established a significant penetration in any of our markets, AmazonGlobal continues to expand its online marketplace and ships into most of our markets, and other regional online retailers, such as MercadoLibre, have continued to increase their presence in our markets. We have a strategic partnership with Rappi in Colombia that allows our Members to use Rappi's platform to place online orders, but we do not have this arrangement with other online retailers. It is possible that Amazon will increase its presence or that other major international retailers, or smaller regional companies will increase their penetration of online shopping. In either case, sales through our online platform or warehouse clubs could be adversely affected.\n\n12\n\n\nWe are exposed to significant weather events and other natural disaster risks that might not be adequately compensated by insurance, and we are susceptible to the long-term impacts of climate change.\n\nOur operations are subject to volatile weather conditions and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and volcanic activity, which occur periodically in the regions in which our warehouse clubs and other facilities are located. Natural disasters could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more clubs or distribution centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and employees to reach our clubs, extended power outages and spoilage of our fresh and frozen food products, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, disruption in the supply of products or increases in the costs of procuring products. For example, in early fiscal year 2018, operations at our USVI warehouse club were adversely affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The warehouse club was closed for nine days, and after re-opening, the warehouse club operated with limited hours for 16 days due to a government-imposed curfew. Damaged and destroyed roads restricted traffic flow, adversely affecting customer access for some time after the hurricane. Future losses from business interruption may not be adequately compensated by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Physical risks include extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory or interrupt our business operations and supply chain and temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers. We also may experience changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate change as well as new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance and operational costs, including compliance with newly adopted legislation in California that will require certain companies that do business in California, including PriceSmart, to report annually on their direct Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 value chain emissions, and to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk.\n\nWe face difficulties in the shipment of, and risks inherent in the importation of, merchandise to our warehouse clubs.\n\nOur warehouse clubs typically import nearly half or more of the merchandise that they sell. This merchandise originates from various countries and is transported over long distances, over water and over land, which results in:\n\n•substantial lead times needed between the procurement and delivery of products, thus complicating merchandising and inventory controls;\n\n•the possible loss of products due to theft or potential damage to, or destruction of, ships or containers delivering goods;\n\n•product markdowns due to the prohibitive cost of returning merchandise upon importation;\n\n•product registration, tariffs, customs and shipping regulation issues in the locations we ship to and from; \n\n•the possibility of business interruption due to transportation and port strikes;\n\n•ocean freight and duty costs; and\n\n•possible governmental restrictions on the importation of merchandise.\n\nCivil unrest in certain countries in which we operate may adversely affect the flow of goods through those countries. For example, protestors set up roadblocks in Panama during October and November 2023 as a reaction to an agreement between the Panamanian government and a mining company, disrupting traffic to our clubs throughout most of the market. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Panama once again experienced widespread protests and social unrest against the government. Roadblocks in Guatemala in October 2023 relating to election protests also limited access to certain of our warehouse clubs. Civil unrest in Colombia in response to tax reform and austerity measures paralyzed significant portions of the country’s infrastructure as roadblocks and riots disrupted normal economic activity during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.\n\nMoreover, each country in which we operate has different governmental rules and regulations regarding the importation of foreign products. Changes to the rules and regulations governing the importation of merchandise may result in additional delays, costs or barriers in our deliveries of products to our warehouse clubs or may affect the type of products we select to import. For example, in May 2023, disputes with Nicaraguan customs and tax authorities resulted in delays in the issuance of our importation clearance and general delays in the customs inspection process. These delays resulted in our being unable to import merchandise into Nicaragua for several weeks in June 2023.\n\n13\n\n\nIn addition, only a limited number of transportation companies service our regions. The inability or failure of one or more key transportation companies to provide transportation services to us, any collusion among the transportation companies regarding shipping prices or terms, changes in the regulations that govern shipping tariffs or the importation of products, or any other disruption to our ability to import our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our distribution centers or supply chain network could disrupt our ability to provide adequate supplies of merchandise to our warehouse clubs.\n\nWe rely on our Miami distribution center, our regional distribution center and several smaller local distribution centers to supply merchandise to our warehouse clubs. Any interruption or failure in the operation of our distribution centers, such as disruptions due to fire, severe weather or other catastrophic events, cyberattacks, network or power outages, labor shortages or disagreements, shipping or infrastructure problems, food safety concerns, integration of new distribution centers, inability of our new distribution centers to perform as expected or contractual disputes with third-party service providers could result in increased expenses and adversely impact our ability to distribute products to our warehouse clubs. Such interruptions could result in lost sales and a loss of Member loyalty, as well as increased costs from third-party service providers. \n\nIn addition, unexpected delays in deliveries from vendors or increases in distribution and transportation costs (including through increased labor or fuel costs) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Labor shortages, work stoppages or other disruptions affecting our supply chain also could negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are subject to payment-related risks, including risks to the security of payment card information. \n\nWe accept payments using an increasing variety of methods, including cash, checks, wire transfers, our co-branded credit cards and a variety of other credit and debit cards. Our operations, like those of most retailers, require the transmission of information associated with cashless payments. As we offer new payment options to our Members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations and compliance requirements, along with the risk of higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide secure and reliable payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers.\n\nWe are also subject to payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. If we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for banks’ compromised card re-issuance costs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our Members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Failures or disruptions in data communication and transfer services also could significantly impact our ability to transact payments to vendors and process credit and debit card transactions. Lastly, we or our customers may experience “spoofing” transactions, particularly with respect to wire transfers, which could cause us to make payments to impostor vendors or result in our not receiving timely payment from customers for merchandise we have sold. \n\nWe face the possibility of operational interruptions related to union work stoppages. \n\nWe currently have unionized employees in three of our markets (Trinidad, Barbados and Panama), and our operations depend on shipping, trucking, ports and other elements of the supply chain that often rely on unionized labor. A work stoppage or other limitation on operations from union or other labor-related matters could occur for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements. For example, while it did not impact our export activities, we experienced a brief disruption to the flow of imported merchandise into our Miami distribution center operations because of the U.S. dockworkers strike in October 2024. A lengthy work stoppage or significant limitation on operations could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n14\n\n\nRisks Associated with Our Business Strategy and Operations\n\nAny failure by us to manage our widely dispersed operations could adversely affect our business. \n\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had 56 warehouse clubs in operation, located in 12 countries and one U.S. territory (ten in Colombia; nine in Costa Rica; seven each in Panama and Guatemala; five in Dominican Republic; four each in Trinidad and El Salvador; three in Honduras; two each in Nicaragua and Jamaica; and one each in Aruba, Barbados and the United States Virgin Islands). We need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing infrastructure, systems and procedures, financial controls, operating controls, inventory, and safety controls and make upgrades from time to time. Moreover, we are required to continually analyze the sufficiency of our inventory distribution channels and systems and may require additional or expanded facilities in order to support our operations. We may not adequately anticipate all the changing demands that will be imposed on these systems. Any failure of our systems or our inability to effectively update our internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe depend on maintaining and expanding our membership base, and any harm to our relationship with our Members could have a material adverse effect on our business, net sales and results of operations.\n\nMembership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry, beginning over 49 years ago at Price Club, the first membership warehouse club business. We believe membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership fees contribute to our ability to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Further, our net sales are directly affected by the number of membership cardholders, the frequency with which our Members shop at our clubs and online and the amount they spend, which means the loyalty and enthusiasm of our Members directly impacts our net sales and operating income. Accordingly, anything that would harm our relationship with our existing Members or our ability to continue to attract new Members could materially adversely affect our net sales, membership fee income and results of operations. \n\nFactors that could adversely affect our relationship with our Members include: our failure to provide good value to Members on the goods and services we offer; our failure to provide the expected quality of merchandise; our failure to offer the right mix of merchandise; events that harm our reputation or the reputation of our “Member’s Selection®” brand; our failure to provide convenience online and in-store shopping; increases to our membership fees; and increased competition. \n\nWe might not identify in a timely manner or effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences for merchandise, which could adversely affect our relationship with Members, demand for our products and market share.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and changes in consumer preferences for merchandise. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our Members will demand. Failure to timely identify or respond effectively to changing consumer tastes, preferences or spending patterns could adversely affect our relationship with our Members, the demand for our products and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting sales trends and adjusting purchases accordingly, we might have too much or too little inventory of certain products. If we buy too much of a product, we might be required to reduce prices or otherwise liquidate the excess inventory, which could have an adverse effect on margins (net sales less merchandise costs) and operating income. For example, we took significant markdowns in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 when we had excessive amounts of slow-moving inventory because of changing consumer preferences as Members began to resume buying patterns similar to our pre-pandemic sales mix. If we do not have sufficient quantities of a popular product, we might lose sales and profits we otherwise could have made. As our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, retain, and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy, data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence, and data security, as well as customer expectations around data collection, retention, and use.\n\n15\n\n\nFuture sales growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully open new warehouse clubs in our existing and new markets. \n\nSales growth at existing warehouse clubs can be impacted by, among other things, the physical limitations of the warehouse clubs, which restrict the amount of merchandise that can be safely stored and displayed in the warehouse clubs and the number of Members that can be accommodated during business hours. As a result, sales growth will depend, in part, upon our acquiring suitable sites for additional warehouse clubs. Land for purchase or lease, or buildings to be leased, in the size and locations in those markets that would be suitable for new PriceSmart warehouse clubs may be limited in number or not be available or financially feasible. In this regard, we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Additionally, local land use, environmental and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouse clubs and distribution facilities, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouse clubs or distribution facilities at specific sites, may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouse clubs and distribution facilities. We have experienced these limitations in Colombia, primarily in Bogotá, and in some of our other existing markets, which has negatively affected our growth rates in those markets. Limitations on the availability of appropriate sites for new warehouse clubs and distribution facilities in the areas targeted by us could have a material adverse effect on the future growth of PriceSmart.\n\nNew warehouse club openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of opening costs and lower sales and contribution to overall profitability during the initial period following opening. New clubs typically build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature clubs. New clubs may not achieve sustained sales and operating levels consistent with our more mature store base on a timely basis or at all. In addition, in some cases, we have more than one warehouse club in a single metropolitan area, and we may open new warehouse clubs in certain areas where we already have warehouse clubs. A new warehouse club in an area already served by existing warehouse clubs may draw Members away from existing warehouse clubs and adversely affect comparable store sales performance. We operate in relatively small markets. Given the growth of our sales over the past few years, market saturation could impact the rate of future sales growth.\n\nWe intend to open warehouse clubs in new markets in the future, including Chile. The risks associated with entering a new market include potential difficulties in attracting Members due to a lack of familiarity with us and our lack of familiarity with local Member preferences. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. As a result, our new warehouse clubs might not be successful in new markets.\n\nFailure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail channels and the investments we are making to develop a robust e-commerce platform could materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and/or financial performance.\n\nThe retail business is quickly evolving, and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing, and the pace of this increase could accelerate. As demonstrated by our launch of our PriceSmart.com and our mobile app and the upgrade of our point-of-sale system, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce, technology and other customer initiatives. The success of our e-commerce initiative continues to depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels. Operating an e-commerce platform and fulfillment of online orders is a complex undertaking, and there is no guarantee that the resources we have applied to this effort will result in increased revenues or improved operating performance. If we do not maintain a successful and relevant omni-channel experience for our Members, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our warehouse clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our clubs, materially affecting the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. In addition, our investments in e-commerce and technology initiatives will adversely impact our short-term financial performance, and our failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. \n\n16\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers, and we have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise. \n\nWe have important ongoing relationships with various third-party suppliers of services and merchandise. These include, but are not limited to, local, regional, and international merchandise suppliers, information technology suppliers, equipment suppliers, financial institutions, credit card issuers and processors, and lessors. Significant changes in the relationships or the agreements that govern the terms through which business is conducted could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise, and any supplier could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. One of our significant suppliers operates a warehouse club business and may in the future seek to compete with us in some of our markets. In addition, the manner in which we acquire merchandise, either directly from the supplier’s parent company or through a local subsidiary or distributor, is subject to change from time to time based on changes initiated by the supplier and for reasons beyond our control. Significant changes or disruptions in how we acquire merchandise from these suppliers could negatively affect our access to such merchandise, as well as the cost of merchandise to us and hence our Members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nOur failure to maintain our brand and reputation could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to preserve and enhance our brand and reputation. Damage to the PriceSmart brand could adversely impact merchandise sales, diminish Member trust, reduce Member renewal rates and impair our ability to add new Members. A failure to maintain and enhance our reputation also could lead to loss of new opportunities or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. Negative incidents, such as a data breach or product recall, can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. In particular, the propagation of negative publicity on social media, whether merited or not, can have a damaging effect on our business in one or more markets. In addition, we sell many products under our private label “Member’s Selection®” brand. If we do not maintain consistent product quality of our “Member’s Selection®” products, which generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouse clubs, our net warehouse sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected and Member loyalty could be harmed. Also, accidents or personal injuries that sometimes occur in our facilities, such as a Member slipping and falling or injuries caused by product falling from a rack, could result in negative publicity or otherwise damage the Company's reputation. \n\nWe face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity.\n\nIf our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, medication, children's products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our Members’ expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items exposes us to the risk of product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our Members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. In particular, we may inadvertently redistribute food products or prepare food products that are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury or death if the contaminants are not eliminated by processing at the food service or consumer level. We package and market fresh produce products within our markets, so we may be exposed to additional risk of product liability and adverse publicity if those fresh food products are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury or death if the contaminants are not eliminated by processing at our packaging service centers.\n\nWe generally seek contractual indemnification and proof of insurance from our major suppliers and carry product liability insurance for all products we sell to or package for our Members. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability claims relating to products that are contaminated or otherwise harmful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our products and on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential Members and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n17\n\n\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Failure to adequately maintain our systems, or disruptions to them, could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nGiven the high volume of individual transactions we process each year, we seek to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. Our information systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our computer systems and backup systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\nWe depend on third-party service providers to support transaction and payment processing, data security and other technology services. Any interruption in the operations of these service providers could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on us. For example, in 2022, a third-party provider supporting our point-of-sale system became insolvent, requiring us to quickly develop and implement short-term workarounds and delaying our migration to a cloud-based system integrating in-store and online functionality.\n\nFrom time to time, we make technology investments to improve or replace key information processes and systems that support our business. The risk of system disruption increases when changes are made to these processes and systems. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the right investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not deliver the anticipated benefits, or they may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. For example, we are in the midst of migrating to the Toshiba Elera™ point-of-sale system and if we cannot successfully implement this product, or experience significant delays, it may jeopardize our operations or result in additional costs. \n\nNot updating our systems on a timely basis could leave us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. We will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than we are in utilizing and integrating rapidly evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our current ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system is no longer supported by its developer, which could increase the risk of a disruption. In addition, newer versions of some of our other internal systems offered by the vendors, offer greater functionality and reliability that we have not yet implemented. We also continue to rely on other systems we developed internally a number of years ago, and we are in the process of migrating these systems to more industry-standard technologies. Several years ago, we began evaluating options to replace our ERP system. However, we intentionally deferred this project as originally contemplated in order to more thoroughly assess our overall IT landscape. We decided that the risk, cost, and implementation cycle time of a holistic ERP system was not a sound strategy. We instead turned our focus to a coordinated program of upgrading packaged applications and replacing in-house applications with packaged applications designed to improve our capabilities with less risk, and in less time. We are continuing to work on the implementation of a packaged forecast and replenishment system (RELEX) for buying and upgrades to our packaged WMS (Warehouse Management System), TMS (Transportation Management System) and GTM (Global Trade Management) for logistics. We believe these upgrades plus several other projects, such as our point-of-sale system replacement and e-commerce/mobile application upgrade, will modernize our key revenue-generating systems and reduce the risk of disruption. However, if we are not successful with this strategy, we might be required to operate with obsolete technology and face the risk of system disruption, putting us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. \n\nWe have also begun implementing modern package Human Capital Management systems for time & attendance (UKG), core HR functions (Workday), and payroll to replace older applications that rely primarily on internal support. These initiatives might not deliver the anticipated benefits, may do so on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost, or may disrupt our business.\n\n18\n\n\nAny failure by us to maintain the security of the information we hold relating to our Company, Members, employees, and vendors, could damage our reputation with them, disrupt our operations, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, expose us to litigation, and materially affect our operating results.\n\nWe receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our Members and employees, and we entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. In addition, we and our third-party service providers store and maintain health-related personal information, pharmacy, and medical records in connection with our health and wellness and pharmacy businesses. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, cloud services, back-office support, and other functions and our online operations depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information used for cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in companies’ information systems. The use of remote work infrastructure has also increased cybersecurity risk, as remote work continues even post-COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and the integration of machine learning technologies into our internal systems may intensify our cybersecurity risks and create new risks to our business, operations, and financial condition.\n\nThe use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated in all our operating countries. Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in increased costs due to, among other things, system changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\n\nWe or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems. Error or malfeasance by our employees or consultants, faulty password management, or other irregularities may result in the defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or our third-party service providers` information systems (whether digital or otherwise). As a result, one or more hackers, cyber terrorists or others might obtain the personal information of Members, employees and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Our logging capabilities, or those of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. We, or one of our third-party service providers may also be subject to a ransomware or cyber-extortion attack, which could significantly disrupt our operations. In the enterprise context, ransomware attacks involve restricting access to computer systems or vital data until a ransom is paid.\n\nAny breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any Members and/or employees whose personal data was compromised to restore Member and employee confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with our Members, employees, vendors and stockholders, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity; could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance; and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to further upgrade the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information, resulting in a disruption of our operations.\n\nWe regularly reassess these risks in response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, and any significant changes are promptly communicated to executive management and our Board or Audit Committee. There are no assurances that our cybersecurity risk management program, policies, controls, or procedures will be fully implemented, complied with, or effectively protect our systems and information. We have not identified, and are not aware of, any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our security measures, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with whom we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that materially affects us. \n\n19\n\n\nOur use of artificial intelligence in our business or more rapid adoption of artificial intelligence by our competitors could result in harm to our brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nSome of our computer systems currently, and might in the future, incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions, including machine learning and generative AI tools that collect, aggregate, and analyze data to assist in the operations of our business. These applications may become increasingly important in our operations over time. This emerging technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. For example, AI algorithms are based on machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create accuracy issues, unintended biases, and discriminatory outcomes that could harm our brand, reputation, business, or Members. Additionally, any investments we make in AI technologies might not actually make us more efficient. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their businesses more rapidly or more successfully than us, which could hinder our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. The technologies underlying AI are rapidly developing, and it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks related to the use of AI. While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our business.\n\nAny failure by us to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, or our actual or alleged infringement of other companies’ intellectual property, could harm our business.\n\nWe depend on our brands, such as the PriceSmart name and logo, to attract Members and make sales of goods and services. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademarks and other intellectual property, and rely on trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries in which we operate.   We also rely on copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our trademarks, trade names, proprietary information, technologies, and processes. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights, and we may be unable to broadly enforce all of our trademarks. Any unauthorized use of our trademarks or other intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.  \n\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that we do not, or will not in the future, infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly, time-consuming and harmful to our reputation or could result in injunctive or other equitable relief that may require us to make changes to our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. \n\nWe may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations.\n\nBusiness acquisitions or divestitures and new business initiatives could adversely impact the Company’s performance.\n\nFrom time to time, we may consider acquisition opportunities and new business initiatives. During fiscal year 2018, we acquired Aeropost, Inc. (“Aeropost”). Acquisitions and new business initiatives involve certain inherent risks, including the failure to retain key personnel from an acquired business; undisclosed or subsequently arising liabilities or accounting, internal control, regulatory or compliance issues associated with an acquired business; challenges in the successful integration of operations, and alignment of standards, policies and systems; future developments that may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets; and the potential diversion of management resources from existing operations to respond to unforeseen issues arising in the context of the integration of a new business or initiative.\n\nWe sold the legacy casillero and marketplace businesses operated by Aeropost in October 2021. In connection with this sale, we retained the technology and intellectual property rights required for the furtherance of our business interest in PriceSmart.com and related capabilities. We could incur unforeseen expenses or other issues in connection with the separation of these businesses. In addition, we and the buyer of the legacy casillero and marketplace businesses agreed to indemnify each other for any breach of representations and warranties we made to one another in the purchase agreement. Pursuant to these indemnification obligations, during fiscal year 2023, we wrote off approximately $700,000 of accounts receivable from Aeropost to fully settle claims from Aeropost’s acquiror alleging that we breached representations and warranties regarding cybersecurity matters and worker classification.\n\n20\n\n\nFailure to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel. If we were to lose the services of a key member of our management team or a significant number of key team members within a short period of time or if we fail to execute management transitions when members of the Company’s senior leadership retire or otherwise leave the Company, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline. We must attract, develop and retain a growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to adequately attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees in the future.\n\nLegal and Compliance Risks \n\nWe face compliance risks related to our international operations.\n\nIn the United States and within the international markets where we operate, there are multiple laws and regulations that relate to our business and operations. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any failure by us to effectively manage our operations and reporting obligations as required by the various laws and regulations can result in our incurring significant legal costs and fines as well as disruptions to our business and operations. Such failure could also result in investors’ loss of confidence in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our employees, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our employees, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies or circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-corruption laws, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our reputation, business, or financial performance.\n\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities or subject to reserves on the recoverability of tax receivables.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions and any changes we make to our intercompany transaction structure. In recent years, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large multinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.\n\nWe compute our income tax based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall taxes. Changes in tax laws, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In one of the countries where we operate, the government made changes several years ago in the method of computing minimum tax payments, under which the government sought to require retailers to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income (Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). As a result, the Company has made and may continue to make income tax payments substantially in excess of those it would expect to pay based on taxable income, and the rules that allow the Company to obtain refunds or to offset payments that are substantially in excess of taxes payable based on taxable income are unclear or complex. \n\n21\n\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the minimum tax payment dispute in one country. Of this amount, $1.0 million is a reserve we recorded against an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for which we sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million for the unpaid years of the dispute in which we made tax payments using the original computation based on taxable income. As part of the settlement, we will pay the minimum tax on a go-forward basis.\n\nA few of our stockholders own approximately 14.8% of our voting stock as of August 31, 2025, which may make it difficult to complete some corporate transactions without their support and may impede a change in control.\n\nRobert E. Price, the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and affiliates of Mr. Price, including Price Philanthropies, The Price Group, LLC, The Robert & Allison Price Charitable Remainder Trust and various other trusts, collectively beneficially own approximately 14.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Of this amount, approximately 70.5% (i.e., 10.4% of our total outstanding shares) is held by charitable entities. As a result of their beneficial ownership, these stockholders have the ability to significantly affect the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. In addition, this ownership could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, possibly depressing the trading price of our common stock.\n\nFinancial and Accounting Risks \n\nWe are subject to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\n\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had a total of 56 warehouse clubs operating in 12 foreign countries and one U.S. territory, 44 of which operate under currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For fiscal year 2025, approximately 80.1% of our net merchandise sales were in foreign currencies. We may enter into additional foreign countries in the future or open additional locations in existing countries, which may increase the percentage of net merchandise sales denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues, and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period may result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.\n\nIn addition, devaluing foreign local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar could negatively impact the purchasing power of our Members for imported merchandise in those countries. Merchandise imported into our markets is generally purchased by the Company in U.S. dollars and priced and sold in the local currency of that country. If the local currency devalues against the U.S. dollar, we may elect to increase prices in the local currency to maintain our target margins, making the products more expensive for our Members. We may also decide to reduce or modify the flow of merchandise into those markets. Depending on the severity of the devaluation and corresponding price increase (as experienced in Colombia in fiscal year 2023), the demand for, sales of, and profitability of those products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor example, the Colombian peso exchange rate with the U.S. dollar devalued approximately 15% on average throughout fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, reducing the U.S. dollar value of our sales and negatively affecting overall demand for our merchandise in Colombia during that year. In order to mitigate the significant price increase to our Members that would be required to maintain our target margins, we absorbed some of the increase in the costs of goods resulting from the devaluation and took pricing actions on certain product categories, which reduced our Total gross margin during that period until the exchange rate normalized and we were able to return to a more normalized profit margin. However, if the Colombia peso were to weaken again and we were to again absorb the costs of the devaluation or take pricing actions to lower the cost to our Members to mitigate a decrease in demand, consolidated Total gross margins could be negatively impacted.\n\n22\n\n\nFrom time to time, we have experienced a lack of availability of U.S. dollars in certain markets (U.S. dollar illiquidity). This impedes our ability to convert local currencies obtained through merchandise sales into U.S. dollars to settle the U.S. dollar liabilities associated with our imported products or otherwise fund our operations. This illiquidity also increases our foreign exchange exposure to any devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we may incur significant premium costs to convert our local currencies into available tradable currencies and U.S. dollars. For instance, since fiscal year 2017, we have experienced this situation in Trinidad and have been unable to source a sufficient level of tradable currencies. We are working with our banks in Trinidad and government officials to convert all of our Trinidad dollars into tradable currencies. Our balance as of August 31, 2025 of Trinidad dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments measured in U.S. dollars was $59.7 million, a decrease of $40.8 million from the peak of $100.5 million as of November 30, 2020. However, as the Trinidad central bank strictly manages the exchange rate of the Trinidad dollar with the U.S. dollar and affects the level of U.S. dollar liquidity in the market through its interventions, we are subject to continued challenges in converting our Trinidad dollars to U.S. dollars, as well as being exposed to the risk of a potential devaluation of the currency. While we are currently able to source substantially all the U.S. dollars that we need in Honduras, we faced similar U.S. dollar liquidity challenges in Honduras during fiscal year 2023 through much of fiscal year 2025 and the Central bank still has strict controls there on the availability of U.S. dollars.\n\nVolatility and uncertainty regarding the currencies and economic conditions in the countries where we operate could have a material impact on our operations in future periods.\n\nChanges in accounting standards and assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by our management. These include, but are not limited to assumptions, projections, estimates and judgements related to contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, projections, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\n\nFor example, because of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842), which the Company adopted September 1, 2019, the Company is required to recognize a “Right-of-Use” (ROU) asset and lease liability for each of the Company’s long-term leases. Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 requires that the ROU asset be designated as a non-monetary asset and the lease liability as a monetary liability. Therefore, when accounting for a lease that is denominated in a foreign currency, if remeasurement into the lessee’s functional currency is required, the lease liability is remeasured using the current exchange rate. We have leases in several of our subsidiaries in which the lease payments are denominated in a foreign currency that is not the functional currency of that entity. Therefore, we are subject to additional volatility in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of this accounting standard update. The monetary lease liability subject to revaluation as of August 31, 2025 was $52.7 million. Due to the mix of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal year 2025, the impact to the consolidated statements of income of revaluing this liability was immaterial.",
