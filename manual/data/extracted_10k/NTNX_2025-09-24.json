We also sell to service providers, which also use the Nutanix Cloud Platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. We had a broad and diverse base of over 29,000 end customers as of July 31, 2025. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments, or subsidiaries, and the total number of end customers may contract due to mergers, acquisitions, or other consolidation among existing end customers.\n\nGrowth Strategy\n\nKey elements of our current growth strategy include:\n\n•Landing new end customers. We intend to continue to grow our customer footprint through targeted investments in sales and marketing, our network of channel partners, and strengthening our OEM partnerships. In addition, we believe that the recent expansion of our platform to support external storage and the strengthening of our Kubernetes capabilities help enable us to address a broader range of customer infrastructure needs and deployment preferences. We believe that our evolving platform and product portfolio will enable us to address a larger customer base.\n\n•Expanding sales to existing end customers. Our end customers typically deploy our technology initially for a specific workload. Our sales teams and channel partners then target follow-on opportunities to drive additional purchases by expanding capacity for the existing workload, targeting new workloads, upselling higher product tiers, and cross-selling new products. We believe this land-and-expand strategy enables us to expand our footprint within our existing customer base. We also believe that our platform's recent expansion to support external storage and strengthened Kubernetes capabilities drive opportunities to expand with existing end customers.\n\n•Driving renewals and retention in existing end customers. In addition to our land-and-expand strategy, as part of our subscription-based business model, we intend to continue to focus on adoption and renewals among our existing customer base. Our focus on adoption drives customer value and stickiness. Our renewals are associated with lower sales costs as compared to landing new customers or expanding into our existing customer base, and help us drive profitable growth.\n\n5\n\n\n  •Building on our hybrid multicloud vision. We intend to continue investing in our vision to make the Nutanix Cloud Platform the platform of choice to run applications and manage data, anywhere. We believe our platform can enable customers to accelerate their strategic initiatives to modernize legacy lT infrastructure and deploy modern applications and enterprise AI.\n\n•Deepening engagement with channel, OEM, cloud, and ecosystem partners. We have established strong partnerships, and driven commercial success with several major channel, OEM, cloud, and ecosystem partners. We intend to continue to deepen relationships with existing channel and OEM partners and expand our partner ecosystem globally, while also supporting deployment of our software on qualified hardware and hosted services.\n\n•Driving profitable growth. We intend to continue to invest in our growth, while balancing such growth against our operating expenses. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can sustain profitable growth. Key drivers of profitable growth include landing new customers, a growing base of renewals, expansions with existing customers, leveraging our partner and alliance ecosystem, and a continued focus on improving operational efficiencies across sales, marketing, and research and development.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales. We primarily engage with our end customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with our channel partners, who represent many of the key resellers and distributors of data center infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate. We also engage our end customers through our OEM partners, which license our software and package it with their hardware and sell through their direct sales forces and channel partners. We expect to continue leveraging our relationships with our channel and OEM partners, and deepening relationships with our cloud and ecosystem partners, to reach our end customers.\n\nMarketing. Our marketing team enables our global sales force and sales via our partner ecosystem. Our marketing focuses on educating our customers, prospects, partners, media and analysts, and influencers about the benefits and business outcomes our cloud software platform and solutions can deliver. The breadth of our product portfolio allows us to engage multiple buyer and user personas across the organization, including senior executives, IT professionals, and developers. Over the past year, we have focused on driving market awareness of our virtualization, cloud native, and enterprise AI-ready capabilities amid ongoing industry disruption. In addition, we continue to drive market awareness of our evolution from a pioneer in HCI to a provider of a unified platform that helps enterprises manage the growing complexity of virtualized, containerized and enterprise AI workloads across hybrid multicloud environments. We seek to create and capture buyer demand through a variety of outbound and inbound marketing programs that include email, digital marketing, corporate and third-party events that generate customer and prospect awareness - including our annual user event, .NEXT, in-person and virtual demand generation activities, social media outreach, media and analyst relations activities, learning certifications, community programs, platform test drives, thought leadership, and our website. Our robust community empowers customers and partners to share and discuss best practices for leveraging our solutions as well as network with peers. We foster strategic marketing partnerships with our ecosystem of technology, channel, OEM, system integrator, and service provider partners to expand market reach, increase brand awareness, and drive business growth. Through our unified Elevate Partner Program, we offer qualified partners access to market development funds, co-branded marketing campaigns, joint demand programs, and comprehensive learning paths.\n\n6\n\n\n  Research and Development\n\nOur research and development efforts are focused primarily on enhancing our existing technologies, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets, and supporting existing end customer deployments. Our research and development teams include distributed systems software engineers, platform engineers, systems engineers, user interface engineers and user experience designers. A large portion of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California and India. We also maintain research and development centers in North Carolina, Serbia, Washington, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts and intend to continue to invest in our global research and development teams to support enhancements to our solutions, improve integration with ecosystem partners, and expand the range of technologies and features available through our platform. We believe that these investments will support our long-term growth strategy, although they may result in increased expenses and adversely affect our profitability in the near term.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe do not manufacture any hardware. The Nutanix-branded NX series hardware platforms are manufactured by Super Micro Computer, Inc. (\"Supermicro\"). Supermicro designs, assembles and tests the Nutanix-branded NX series hardware platforms and it procures the components used in the NX series hardware platforms directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Supermicro automatically renews annually in May for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end customers, but do not hold inventory.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe operate in the intensely competitive cloud infrastructure and platform services markets and compete with a broad range of companies that sell software and hardware to build and operate private clouds, integrated systems and standalone storage and servers, as well as cloud services providers and managed service providers. These markets are characterized by constant change, rapid innovation, and evolving licensing and consumption models. We face competition from a broad range of providers, including, among others:\n\n•software providers that offer virtualization, containerization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise and hybrid clouds, such as VMware by Broadcom, Microsoft, and Red Hat;\n\n•providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Azure; and\n\n•traditional IT systems vendors, such as Dell, Fujitsu, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, Lenovo, Pure Storage, Inc., NetApp, Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., many of which offer integrated systems that bundle servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as standalone server and storage products.\n\nCompetition generally varies by workload and customer segment, and customers often evaluate multiple alternatives simultaneously. Several of our competitors are also our partners, resellers, or OEMs in certain offerings. As the market in which we compete continues to develop, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may also expand their product and service offerings, acquire or invest in competing businesses or emerging technologies, offer differentiated pricing terms, bundle their products with other products and capabilities (including AI, machine learning, generative AI, and emerging agentic AI capabilities), provide closed technology platforms, partner with other companies to develop joint solutions, or otherwise leverage their scale, brand recognition or ecosystem relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets, and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to cooperate with us as an OEM or otherwise.\n\n7\n\n\n  We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:\n\n•platform features and capabilities;\n\n•system scalability, performance and resiliency;\n\n•the ecosystem of certified applications, services, and solutions for our platform;\n\n•management and operations, including provisioning, troubleshooting, analytics, automation, and upgrades;\n\n•total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;\n\n•customer freedom of choice over, and product interoperability with, third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems, and platforms and public clouds;\n\n•the ability to compete with incumbent vendors whose deeply integrated solutions and long-term commercial arrangements may limit customer flexibility and increase switching costs;\n\n•application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and\n\n•quality of customer experience, including ease-of-use, support and professional services.\n\nWe have also strategically expanded into a number of markets that are adjacent to our core HCI market, both through the expansion in hybrid multicloud environments as well as through our addition of new functionality and features in our platform and through portfolio products. These adjacent markets include areas such as Kubernetes management and data and platform services, AI platform services, cloud disaster recovery, data security, governance and compliance, cloud management, files and object storage, and database automation and database-as-a-service. Competitors in these markets include large, sophisticated companies that may have more experience or longer operating histories in these markets as well as new entrants.\n\nWe believe that we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, a larger existing customer base, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2025, we had 578 U.S. patents that have been issued and 159 non-provisional patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2033 and 2045. We also leverage some open source software in most of our products. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.\n\nFacilities\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under lease agreements that expire through May 2030, we currently lease approximately 215,000 square feet of space. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that, should it be needed, we would be able to lease suitable additional space to accommodate our operations.\n\n8\n\n\n  Government Regulation\n\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, acquisitions, AI-related governance, data protection and data privacy, climate, employment and labor, and taxes could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" for further discussion of risks related to the potential impact of government regulation on our business.\n\nEmployees and Human Capital\n\nWe had approximately 7,800 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2025. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils and/or industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\n\nWe understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building our culture, talent development, and compensation and benefits. Our human capital resources objectives include attracting, retaining, and rewarding talent, as well as promoting the development and integration of our existing and new employees. The principal objectives of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, to drive stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to align their work to company goals, and to perform to the best of their abilities and to achieve our objectives.\n\nCulture\n\nOur values are the framework that defines our culture and shape how we engage with one another, approach challenges, and work toward solutions:\n\n•Hungry – We are relentlessly driven to innovate, improve, and lead. \n\n•Humble – We stay grounded, always learning from each other and our customers. \n\n•Honest – Transparency, trust, and integrity guide every interaction.\n\n•with Heart – We approach every challenge with empathy, compassion, and a commitment to making a positive impact. \n\nOur culture principles also shape the way we work and define how we engage with each other and with our customers. These principles are designed to drive performance, foster innovation, and ensure that we remain focused on delivering value, both to our employees and our stakeholders:\n\n•We Own It – We take accountability for our actions, results, and decisions.\n\n•We Work as One Team – Collaboration is key. We work together to achieve common goals and celebrate our collective success. \n\n•We Obsess About Our Customers' Success – Our customers’ success is our success. Everything we do is aimed at driving value for them. \n\n•We Think Long-Term – We prioritize sustainability, future-focused growth, and enduring impact over short-term wins.\n\n9\n\n\n  Total Rewards \n\nWe believe a robust and competitive Total Rewards portfolio is essential to attracting and retaining diverse talent that moves Nutanix forward. Our comprehensive reward programs offer physical, mental/emotional, and financial support to our employees and their families. We regularly review our programs and encourage employee feedback about the rewards they value most. We tailor rewards programs specifically based on local market practice and the competitive landscape. We provide a range of globally-available support programs, such as an Employee Assistance Program, online health engagement, and child development support.\n\nHealth, Wellness, and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of employees and others on our property are a top priority. We also focus on compliance with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. To that end, appropriate requirements are implemented, as needed, in order to comply with public health or safety obligations. We have a physical security policy applicable to all our employees with a global physical security team that is empowered to protect the safety of our employees in the event of emergencies or disasters. In addition, we work with our employees and facilities management at our office locations to ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous conditions. Employees are required to be conscientious about workplace safety. In compliance with applicable laws, and to promote the concept of a safe workplace, we maintain an Injury and Illness Prevention Program. We also continue to support the well-being and continued development of our employees by offering well-being days, during which all employees may enjoy private time away from work requirements.\n\nGrowth and Development\n\nWe challenge our employees to constantly learn, continuously improve and evolve -- and to that end we invest in resources to foster a learning culture throughout our company. We empower our employees to drive their own personal and professional growth by equipping them with onboarding and learning programs. Our learning programs include digital learning, speed coaching, customized learning workshops, manager enablement and skills training for current, new and future managers, training on culture, language learning programs, and employee wellness programs. We believe that by empowering our employees as they strive to grow personally and professionally, we will be able to build a flexible and resilient workforce and maintain and nurture a robust pipeline of talent to fuel our future growth and strategy.\n\nInformation about Segment and Geographic Areas\n\nThe segment and geographic information required herein is contained in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in September 2009 as Nutanix, Inc.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face; additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition, the global macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, which may adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\n\nSummary Risk Factors\n\nOur business and an investment in our securities are subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n•our ability to achieve our business plans, vision, and objectives, including our growth and go-to-market strategies, successfully and in a timely manner;\n\n•macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions, industry trends, and technological developments, including disruptions and delays in global supply chains;\n\n•the competitive market, including our competitive position, advantages and ability to compete effectively, and ability to increase our market share;\n\n•our ability to capitalize on opportunities arising from Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware and related changes to its product portfolio and business model;\n\n•our ability to predict future financial performance from our historical financial performance;\n\n•our ability to address customer needs and expand or maintain our customer base;\n\n•our platform, solutions, products, services, and technology, including their interoperability and availability with and on third-party platforms and technologies, any undetected defects in our solutions, and current and future product roadmaps, including expanding our artificial intelligence-related capabilities;\n\n•our ability to form new or maintain and strengthen existing, strategic alliances and partnerships, as well as our ability to manage any changes thereto;\n\n•our reliance on key manufacturers, suppliers or other vendors; and\n\n•any business model transitions.\n\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property\n\n•the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on our platform; and\n\n•our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\n  Risks Related to Employee Matters\n\n•our reliance on key personnel and ability to attract, train, incentivize, retain, and/or ramp to full productivity, qualified employees and key personnel.\n\nRisks Related to Financial, Accounting, Regulatory, Tax, and Other Legal Matters\n\n•our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls;\n\n•any changes to, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations, as well as the impact of any regulatory investigations and enforcement actions and other legal proceedings; and\n\n•complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations.\n\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility\n\n•our ability to service and repay our outstanding convertible notes, including the sufficiency of our cash, or our ability to raise necessary funds, to settle conversions of the notes, repay the notes at maturity, or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change; \n\n•our ability to comply with the covenants in and service any borrowings under our revolving credit facility; and\n\n•the impact of certain provisions of our outstanding convertible notes on our financial condition and operating results, as well as the value of the notes and the price of our securities.\n\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\n\n•any volatility and decline in the market price and/or trading volume of our securities, including as a result of financial or industry analyst reports or a lack thereof;\n\n•any dilutive impact of actual or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public markets and/or the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes;\n\n•any limitations on the ability of holders of our securities to influence corporate matters due to certain provisions of our organizational documents or under Delaware law; \n\n•restrictions on our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees; and \n\n•our plans regarding payment of any future dividends.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n•investors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors.\n\n  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not be able to maintain profitability on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. \n\nWe have incurred GAAP net losses in annual periods from our inception through fiscal 2024, including GAAP net losses of $254.6 million and $124.8 million for fiscal 2023 and 2024, respectively. While we generated GAAP net income in fiscal 2025 and non-GAAP net income in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2025, we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods. As of July 31, 2025, we had an accumulated deficit of $4.9 billion. We expect to continue making significant investments to grow our business. If we fail to grow our revenue or manage our operating expenses effectively, we may not be able to continue generating net income on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. \n\nOur continued focus on growth may negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term.\n\nWe intend to continue balancing our growth against our operating expenses. However, maintaining this balance may make it challenging to sustain profitability on a GAAP basis over time. Further, expenditures related to expanding our research and development efforts, sales and marketing efforts, infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business, revenue or result in continued profitability. Although we achieved GAAP profitability in fiscal 2025, we did not do so in prior years, and there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitability in future periods. If we are ultimately unable to maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders, the price of our securities may decline, potentially significantly.\n\nAdverse or uncertain macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions or reduced IT spending by our end customers may adversely impact our business, revenues and profitability.\n\nOur business, operations and performance are dependent in part on worldwide market, economic and financial conditions and events that may be outside of our control, such as global, regional, and local economic developments, fiscal, monetary and tax policies, high inflation, elevated interest rates, recessionary pressures, political and social unrest, geopolitical tensions, the evolving policy landscape following the 2024 U.S. elections and related shifts in domestic and international policy, terrorist attacks, hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, military conflict, war, including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions, the continuing conflict in the Middle East, malicious human acts, climate change, natural disasters (including extreme weather), pandemics or other major public health concerns, and other similar events. These conditions and events may adversely affect demand for enterprise computing infrastructure solutions and reduce the economic health and IT spending budgets of our current and prospective end customers. The global macroeconomic environment has been, and may continue to be, inconsistent, challenging and unpredictable due to international trade disputes or tensions, the imposition or expansion of tariffs (including those imposed by the U.S. government targeting imports from numerous countries, which may increase the cost of IT products and services and thereby reduce available IT budgets or shift spending priorities away from our solutions), restrictions on sales and technology transfers, elevated interest and inflation rates, uncertainties related to changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations and fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, and taxes, potential changes to international trade agreements, actual or potential government shutdowns, elections and any related political instability, geopolitical turmoil and civil unrest, instability in the global credit markets, and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets.\n\n14\n\n\n  These macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties have, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions and overall IT spending. As a result, our current and prospective end customers may reprioritize spending, delay or cancel purchasing decisions, extend sales cycles, or seek lower pricing for our solutions. These factors may make it difficult for us to forecast sales and operating results, plan future investments, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe enterprise IT market is rapidly changing and expanding, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future from both established competitors and new market entrants.\n\nWe operate in the intensely competitive cloud infrastructure and platform services markets and compete with a broad range of companies that sell software and hardware to build and operate private clouds, integrated systems and standalone storage and servers, as well as cloud services providers and managed service providers. These markets are characterized by constant change, rapid innovation, and evolving licensing and consumption models. We face competition from a broad range of providers, including, among others:\n\n•software providers that offer virtualization, containerization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise and hybrid clouds, such as VMware by Broadcom, Microsoft, and Red Hat;\n\n•providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Azure; and\n\n•traditional IT systems vendors, such as Dell, Fujitsu, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, Lenovo, Pure Storage, Inc., NetApp, Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., many of which offer integrated systems that bundle servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as standalone server and storage products.\n\nCompetition generally varies by workload and customer segment, and customers often evaluate multiple alternatives simultaneously. Several of our competitors are also our partners, resellers, or OEMs in certain offerings. As the market in which we compete continues to develop, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may also expand their product and service offerings, acquire or invest in competing businesses or emerging technologies, offer lower pricing or aggressive discounting, bundle their products with other products and capabilities (including artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, and emerging agentic AI capabilities), provide closed technology platforms, partner with other companies to develop joint solutions, or otherwise leverage their scale, brand recognition or ecosystem relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets, and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to cooperate with us as an OEM or otherwise.\n\n15\n\n\n  Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors may have, competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources, stronger brand awareness and name recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, and broader global presence and distribution networks. They may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products and services than we can, and they may offer heavy discounts, forcing us to compete aggressively on pricing. Moreover, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, such as the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom in November 2023. Furthermore, some of our competitors have access to larger customer bases and supply a wide variety of products to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end customers. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships with end customers, distributors or resellers to provide incentives to such current or prospective end customers that make their products more economically attractive or to interfere with our ability to offer our solutions to our end customers. Our competitors may also be able to offer products or functionality similar to ours at a more attractive price, such as by integrating or bundling their solutions with their other product offerings or those of technology partners or establishing cooperative relationships with other competitors, technology partners or other third parties. Some potential end customers have preferred, and in the future may continue to prefer, to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier, especially given the significant investments that they have historically made in their legacy infrastructures. Some of our competitors may also have stronger or broader relationships with technology partners than we do, which could make their products more attractive than ours. We have also ventured into a number of markets that are adjacent to our core HCI market, both through the expansion of HCI in hybrid multicloud environments as well as through our emerging products, and some of our competitors in these adjacent markets have more experience with those markets and more resources targeted at penetration of those markets than we do. As a result, we cannot assure you that our solutions will compete favorably, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\n\nIn addition, in recent years, an increasing number of customers have been allocating their IT spending toward artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI capabilities. The IT infrastructure market for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI workloads is also expected to be an intensely competitive and rapidly evolving market.\n\nWe may not be able to capitalize on opportunities arising from Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware and related changes to its product portfolio and business model.\n\nWe believe that our opportunity to increase market share has grown since VMware (now known as VMware by Broadcom), one of our main competitors, was acquired by Broadcom in November 2023. Since the acquisition, Broadcom has made changes to VMware by Broadcom’s product portfolio, pricing, and partner programs, which we believe have led many VMware by Broadcom customers to explore alternatives to its virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions. However, a variety of factors could adversely affect the timing and our ability to convert these opportunities. For example, many prospective customers may remain under multi-year VMware by Broadcom contracts or may defer migration until their next hardware or software refresh cycle. In addition, Broadcom may respond aggressively to our pursuit of these opportunities, and we may not be able to compete effectively across customer segments or geographies. Other factors that could limit our ability to capitalize on these opportunities include the length of enterprise sales cycles and customer evaluation of migration and interoperability considerations, and the availability of alternative solutions. Some customers may choose to remain with VMware by Broadcom due to existing investments, perceived switching risks, or contract obligations, while others may select competing vendors offering different architectures, pricing models, or cloud strategies. If we are unable to capitalize on these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n16\n\n\n  The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving, which make it difficult to forecast end customer adoption rates and demand for our solutions.\n\nThe markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend in large part on the allocation of spending in traditional IT markets and on our ability to adapt to new market demands. Currently, sales of our solutions are dependent in large part upon replacement of spending in traditional markets, including x86 servers, storage systems and virtualization software. In addition, as we continue to develop new solutions designed to address new market demands, sales of our solutions will in part depend on capturing new spending in these markets, including public cloud, hybrid cloud and cloud native services. Moreover, in recent years, an increasing number of customers have been allocating their IT spending toward artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI capabilities. The IT infrastructure market supporting AI workloads is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, and our ability to compete effectively in this space will depend on our ability to deliver differentiated, scalable, and AI-ready infrastructure solutions. If the markets in which we compete experience a shift in customer demand, or if customers in these markets focus their new spending on, or shift their existing spending to, public cloud solutions or other solutions that do not interoperate with our solutions more quickly or more extensively than expected, our solutions may not compete as effectively, if at all. It is also difficult to predict end customer demand or adoption rates for our solutions or the future growth of our market.\n\nIn addition, we have estimated the size of our total addressable and serviceable available markets based on internally generated data and assumptions, as well as data published by third parties, which we have not independently verified. While we believe these estimates are reasonable, such information is inherently imprecise and subject to a high degree of uncertainty. If our third-party or internally generated data prove to be inaccurate or we make errors in our assumptions based on that data, our actual market may be more limited than our estimates. In addition, these inaccuracies or errors may cause us to misallocate capital and other critical business resources, which could harm our business. Even if our total addressable market meets our size estimates and experiences growth, we may not continue to grow our share of the market.\n\nIf end customers do not adopt our solutions, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nTraditional IT infrastructure architecture is entrenched in the data centers of many of our end customers because of their historical financial investment in existing IT infrastructure architecture and the existing knowledge base and skill sets of their IT administrators. As a result, our sales and marketing efforts often involve extensive efforts to educate our end customers as to the benefits and capabilities of our solutions, particularly as we introduce new products and continue to pursue large organizations as end customers. If we fail to achieve market acceptance of our solutions, our ability to grow our business and our operating results will be adversely affected.\n\nAs we target some of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition, increased pricing pressure, deployment and customization challenges, and less predictability in our ability to close sales, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\n\nOver time, our sales pipeline has evolved to include a higher mix of larger deal opportunities. Sales to these end customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller end customers. These risks include:\n\n•longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential end customer that elects not to purchase our solutions;\n\n•competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises, service providers and government entities and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such end customers;\n\n17\n\n\n  •increased purchasing power and leverage held by large end customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us; and\n\n•more stringent requirements in our support service contracts, including demand for quicker support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements.\n\nLarge organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle. Although we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective end customers as well as our distributors and resellers. We typically provide evaluation products to these end customers and may spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts to these prospective end customers. In addition, product purchases by large organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. Finally, large organizations typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability, require a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, expect greater payment flexibility (which may delay cash collections and negatively impact our free cash flow), and may also have a greater ability to resist any attempts to pass on increases in our operating and procurement costs. Given these variables, it can be difficult for us to estimate when an expected sale from a large organization, service provider or government entity may occur, and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected. If we fail to realize an expected sale from a large end customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. All of these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these end customers.\n\nOur sales of offerings that support external storage may negatively impact sales of our core HCI offering and alter customer purchasing behavior, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nAs part of our strategy to expand our addressable market and meet the needs of customers invested in legacy three-tier IT infrastructure, we recently expanded our offerings to include support for qualified third-party external storage platforms. While we believe this flexibility may facilitate customer adoption of our platform in brownfield environments and enable longer-term expansion opportunities, it may also negatively impact sales of our core HCI offering. In addition, support for external storage may increase the complexity of our offerings and require additional resources for integration, testing, and customer success. It also increases our reliance on third-party technologies, over which we have limited control. If these third-party platforms experience performance issues, customer dissatisfaction, or changes in strategic direction that affect interoperability with our solutions, our reputation and customer relationships could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if customers adopt our solutions to support external storage as a permanent architecture rather than as a transitional step toward full HCI adoption, our investment in this capability may not yield the anticipated return, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n18\n\n\n  Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, it can be difficult for us to predict when, if ever, a particular customer will choose to purchase our solutions, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\n\nOur sales efforts involve educating our end customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions, including their technical capabilities and cost saving potential. End customers often undertake an evaluation and testing process that can result in a lengthy sales cycle. Increasing competition and the availability or emergence of competing infrastructure, virtualization, and containerization solutions, as well as different consumption models, often result in customers evaluating multiple vendors at the same time, which can further lengthen the sales cycle. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. Platform purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. In addition, because our platform is deployed on a hardware platform and many prospective customers have invested in legacy three-tier infrastructures consisting of separate servers, storage systems, and storage area networks, customers may not be ready to consider adopting our platform unless and until they are due for a hardware refresh, which occurs at intervals. These factors and the legacy relationships that our end customers have with existing IT vendors sometimes lead to unpredictable sales cycles, which make it difficult for us to predict when end customers may purchase solutions from us. The unpredictable nature of our sales cycles may be increased in future periods as we continue to focus our sales efforts more heavily on major accounts and large deals. Our business and operating results will be significantly affected by the degree to which and speed with which organizations adopt our solutions. In addition, over time, our sales pipeline has evolved to include a higher mix of larger deal opportunities. Because larger deal opportunities often take longer to close and require more levels of review from the customer's executive team, involve greater competition, and have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure, this recent trend is expected to drive greater variability in our ability to land new end customers and expand sales to existing end customers, and our top-line results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant growth in prior periods, and we may not be able to sustain or manage any future growth effectively.\n\nWe have expanded our overall business and operations significantly in prior periods. Our employee headcount has increased significantly since our inception. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the long term as we scale our business, including in developing and improving our new and existing solutions, expanding our sales and marketing capabilities and global coverage, and in providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. In addition, as we continue to grow our business in the long term, we must effectively train, integrate, develop, motivate, and retain a large number of new employees, as well as existing employees who are promoted or moved into new roles, while maintaining the effectiveness of our business execution. The failure to manage these changes could significantly delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. In particular, our success depends heavily on our ability to ramp new sales teams in a fast and effective manner and retain those sales teams. In recent years, we have also seen higher-than-normal attrition among our sales representatives and while we are actively recruiting additional sales representatives, it will take time to replace, train, and ramp them to full productivity, and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to achieve our growth targets. We must also continue to improve and expand our IT and financial infrastructure, management systems and product management and sales processes. We expect that our future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and we may not be able to sustain or manage any future growth effectively. We may make investments or otherwise incur costs associated with future growth that may not translate into revenues or otherwise result in the realization of their anticipated benefits within the expected timeframe or at all, and the return on these investments may be lower, if any, or may develop more slowly than we expect.\n\n19\n\n\n  If we are unable to sustain or manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities. We also may fail to satisfy end customers’ requirements, maintain product quality, execute on our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nOur historical financial performance, including revenue growth, may not be indicative of our future performance.\n\nOur historical financial performance, including revenue growth, may not be indicative of our future performance. Over the years, we have undergone several business model transitions, including our transition to focus on software-only sales and our transition to a subscription-based business model. These transitions can make it difficult to compare our current results against our historical results. Operating under a subscription-based business model results in differences in revenue recognition compared to our previous life-of-device model. For example, subscription contracts typically have shorter durations than the assumed five-year duration of contracts under our previous life-of-device license model, which typically results in lower upfront revenue per transaction.\n\n20\n\n\n  If other IT vendors do not cooperate with us to ensure that our solutions interoperate with their products, including by providing us with early access to their new products or information about their new products, our product development efforts may be delayed or impaired, our solutions could become less attractive to end customers and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nOur solutions provide a platform on which software applications and hypervisors from different software providers run. As a result, our solutions must interoperate with our end customers’ existing hardware and software infrastructure, specifically their networks, servers, software, and operating systems, as well as the applications that they run on this infrastructure, which may be manufactured and provided by a wide variety of vendors and OEMs. In addition to ensuring that our solutions interoperate with these hardware and software products initially, we must regularly update our software to ensure that our solutions continue to interoperate with new or updated versions of these hardware and software products. Current or future providers of hardware, software applications, hypervisors, or data management tools could make changes that would diminish the ability of our solutions to interoperate with them. Significant additional time and effort may be necessary to ensure the continued compatibility of our solutions, which might not be possible at all. Even if our solutions are compatible with those of other providers, if they do not certify or support our solutions for their systems or cooperate with us to coordinate troubleshooting and hand off of support cases, end customers may be reluctant to buy our solutions, which could decrease demand for our solutions and harm our ability to achieve a return on the investments and resources that we have dedicated to ensuring compatibility. Developing solutions that interoperate properly requires substantial partnering, capital investment and employee resources, as well as the cooperation of the vendors or developers of the software applications and hypervisors both with respect to product development, certification, and support processes. Vendors may not provide us with early or any access to their technology and products, assist us in these development efforts, certify our solutions, share with or sell to us any application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"), formats, or protocols we may need, or cooperate with us to support end customers. If they do not provide us with the necessary access, assistance or proprietary technology on a timely basis or at all, we may experience product development delays or be unable to ensure the compatibility of our solutions with such new technology or products. Some of these vendors also sell solutions that compete directly or indirectly with our solutions and therefore may not be incentivized to cooperate with us to ensure interoperability, certify our solutions, or support joint customers. To the extent that vendors develop products that compete with ours, they have in the past, and may again in the future, withhold their cooperation, decline to share access, certify our solutions or sell or make available to us their proprietary APIs, protocols or formats or engage in practices to actively limit the functionality, compatibility, certification, or support of our products. If any of the foregoing occurs, our product development efforts may be delayed or impaired, our solutions could become less attractive to end customers resulting in a decline in sales, which could reduce demand for our solutions, impair our competitive position, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and prospects.\n\nIf we fail to successfully execute on our plan to sell more cloud services, which are sold on a ratable subscription-basis, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe have sold and anticipate selling more of our products and services as cloud-based offerings - which include offerings hosted on public cloud infrastructure as well as part of the Nutanix Cloud Platform - on a ratable subscription basis. While cloud-based offerings currently make up a small portion of our business, selling these offerings has required, and will continue to require, a considerable investment of resources and will continue to divert resources and increase costs, especially in cost of license and other revenues, in any given period. We have also made, and intend to continue to make, investments in the supporting infrastructure for such cloud-based offerings that we host and may not recoup the costs of such investments. Such investments of resources may also not improve our long-term growth and results of operations. Further, the increase in some costs associated with our cloud-based services may be difficult to predict over time, especially in light of our lack of historical experience with the costs of delivering cloud-based versions of our solutions.\n\n21\n\n\n  We believe our plan has certain advantages; however, it also presents a number of risks to us including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n•arrangements entered into on a ratable subscription basis may delay when we can recognize revenue, even when compared to similar term-based subscription sales, which we currently recognize upfront, and can require up-front costs, which may be significant;\n\n•since revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer agreement, any decrease in customer purchases of our ratable subscription-based products and services will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. This will also make it difficult for us to increase our revenue through additional ratable subscription sales in any given period;\n\n•cloud-based ratable subscription arrangements are generally under short-term agreements. Accordingly, our customers generally have no long-term obligation to us and may cancel their subscription at any time, even if our customers are satisfied with our cloud-based subscription products; and\n\n•there is no assurance that the cloud-based solutions we offer on a ratable subscription basis, including new products that we may introduce, will receive broad marketplace acceptance.\n\nIf we fail to properly execute on our plan to sell more of our products and services as cloud-based offerings on a ratable subscription basis, our business and operating results would be adversely affected, and the price of our securities could decline.\n\nIf we fail to develop or introduce new or enhanced solutions on a timely or cost-effective basis, our ability to attract and retain end customers could be impaired and our brand, reputation and competitive position could be harmed.\n\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and technological obsolescence. We must continually create valuable software solutions and integrate these solutions across hardware platforms. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market, and sell new or enhanced solutions that provide increasingly higher levels of performance, capacity, scalability, security, interoperability, application mobility, and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our end customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, including generative and agentic AI capabilities, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future solutions obsolete or less attractive to end customers. Any failure to anticipate or develop new or enhanced solutions or technologies in a timely or cost-effective manner in response to technological shifts, including those driven by AI, could result in decreased revenue and harm to our business and prospects. Any new feature or application that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve broad market acceptance and investments in research and development or efforts to optimize our engineering cost structure may not be successful. In particular, if we fail to timely release new products, technology or services that we previously announced, our brand and reputation could be harmed. For example, in May 2023 we announced Project Beacon, our multi-year effort to deliver a portfolio of data-centric infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service-level services available natively anywhere, including on the Nutanix Cloud Platform or on public clouds. In May 2025, we launched Cloud Native AOS, the first product from Project Beacon. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced solutions that meet the needs of our end customers, such as Project Beacon, or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, we may lose market share, and our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected.\n\n22\n\n\n  Developments or improvements in enterprise IT infrastructure technologies may materially and adversely affect the demand for our solutions.\n\nSignificant developments in enterprise IT infrastructure technologies, such as advances in storage, virtualization, containers, networking, disaster recovery, edge computing, management software, and public cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructure solutions, may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, to react to changes or advances in existing technologies or to correctly anticipate these changes or advances as we create and invest in our product roadmap, could materially delay our development and introduction of new solutions, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our solutions, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. In addition, public cloud infrastructure offers alternatives to the on-premises infrastructure deployments that our platform currently primarily supports. Various factors could cause the rate of adoption of public cloud infrastructure to increase, including decreases in the price of public cloud offerings, increased interoperability with on-premises infrastructure solutions that compete with our solutions, and improvements in the ability of public cloud providers to deliver reliable performance, enhanced security, better application compatibility, and more precise infrastructure control. In addition, the rate of adoption of public cloud infrastructure could increase due to increased customer interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI capabilities that may be offered by public cloud providers. Any of these factors could make our platform less competitive as compared to the public cloud and could materially and adversely affect the demand for our solutions.\n\nInvesting in our AI capabilities introduces risks, which, if realized, could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe have made, and expect to continue making, investments in our AI capabilities across our business, products, and services, including efforts to position the Nutanix Cloud Platform as a preferred platform for running enterprise AI workloads. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies and are subject to an evolving regulatory landscape. The introduction of AI technologies into new or existing products and services may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, privacy, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, legal liability, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. For example, the European Union has enacted the AI Act and in the United States, new AI-related laws and regulations are emerging such as the Colorado AI Act, the California AI Transparency Act,  the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, and the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act, with numerous more being proposed at the federal, state, and local levels. These laws and regulations could require us to comply with various requirements depending on the nature and categorization of AI, and our role. This may result in expending resources and additional costs to comply with these requirements, change our business practices, or provide additional infrastructure, policies, safeguards, and personnel to support the ongoing governance and oversight of such AI technologies, including notice, transparency, and AI risk assessment and mitigation obligations. For example, in the United States, in 2025 the current presidential administration rescinded an executive order relating to the safe and secure development of AI technologies that was previously implemented by the former administration in 2023. The administration then issued a new executive order that, among other things, requires certain agencies to develop and submit to the president action plans to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance,” and to specifically review and, if possible, rescind rulemaking taken pursuant to the rescinded executive order. In July 2025, the current administration further issued America’s AI Action Plan, focusing on the three pillars of innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy and security in AI, and seven underlying principles. The current administration may continue to rescind other existing federal orders and/or administrative policies relating to AI technologies, or may implement new executive orders and/or other rule making relating to AI technologies in the future. Any such changes at the federal level could require us to expend significant resources to modify our products, services, or operations to ensure compliance with old frameworks or meet new obligations.\n\n23\n\n\n  The intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies have not been fully addressed by laws or regulations, and our use or adoption of third-party AI technologies into our business operations, products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation, as well as potential liability to customers.\n\nAI technologies may use algorithms, datasets, or training methodologies that may be flawed or contain deficiencies that may be difficult to detect during testing. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate, flawed, or biased. Use of such content may be to the detriment of the user, or it may lead to discriminatory or other adverse outcomes, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, regulatory scrutiny and fines, and/or legal liability. Further, AI technologies may repurpose data beyond its original intent or without the consent of an individual where required, or involve unintended cross-border transfers, challenging privacy principles and potentially resulting in privacy-related claims, liability, or regulatory scrutiny. As we expand our use of AI technologies, we may be required to update our agreements, policies, and controls to address these risks and meet evolving customer and regulatory expectations.\n\nOur growth depends on our existing end customers renewing or upgrading their subscriptions and support and entitlement agreements and making additional purchases of software licenses and software upgrades, and the failure of our end customers to do so could harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur future success depends on our existing end customers renewing or upgrading their subscription and support and entitlement agreements and making additional purchases of software licenses and software upgrades. If our end customers do not renew or upgrade their subscription and support and entitlement agreements and/or purchase additional software licenses or software upgrades, our revenue may decline, and our operating results may be harmed. In order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, we depend on our existing end customers renewing their subscription agreements as well as their support and entitlement agreements or purchasing additional solutions. End customers may choose not to renew their subscription agreements or support and entitlement agreements, or purchase additional solutions, because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our platform, solutions, support, or prices (including relative to competitive offerings), reductions in our end customers’ spending levels or other causes outside of our control. If our existing end customers do not purchase new solutions or renew or upgrade their subscription agreements or support and entitlement agreements, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or may decline, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely primarily on indirect sales channels for the distribution of our solutions, and disruption within these channels or underperformance by our channel partners could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows.\n\nWe primarily sell our solutions through indirect sales channels, including channel partners, such as distributors, our OEM partners, value added resellers, and system integrators. Our OEM partners may in turn distribute our solutions through their own networks of channel partners with whom we have no direct relationships.\n\n24\n\n\n  We rely, to a significant degree, on our channel partners to select, screen and maintain relationships with their distribution networks and to distribute our solutions in a manner that is consistent with applicable law, regulatory requirements and our quality standards. If our channel partners or a partner in their distribution network violates applicable law or regulations, misrepresents the functionality of our solutions, or otherwise engages in conduct that results in regulatory scrutiny or legal action, our reputation and brand could be damaged, and we could be subject to potential liability. Additionally, if we are unable to establish relationships with strong channel partners in key growth regions, our ability to sell our solutions in these regions may be adversely affected. Our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer end customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. As a result, our channel partners, including our OEM partners, may not be fully incentivized to prioritize or actively promote our solutions, particularly if they also sell their own products or those of our competitors. In addition, we have limited visibility into and control over the sales efforts and go-to-market strategies of our OEM partners, and their sales performance may not meet our expectations. If our OEM partners or other channel partners do not effectively market and sell our solutions, choose to allocate fewer resources to our solutions, or fail to meet the needs of our end customers, our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Our channel partners may cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, together with our inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional channel partners or establish an alternative distribution network could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Sales through our top two distributors to our end customers represented 41% of our total revenue for fiscal 2025. In addition, if a channel partner offers its own products or services that are competitive to our solutions, is acquired by a competitor or reorganizes or divests its reseller business units, our revenue derived from that partner may be adversely impacted or eliminated altogether.\n\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technologies requires significant time and resources. If we fail to devote sufficient resources to support and expand our network of channel partners, our business may be adversely affected. Maintaining strong indirect sales channels for our products and effectively leveraging our channel partners and OEMs is important to our growth strategy, and the failure to effectively manage these relationships may lead to higher costs and reduced revenue. Although we believe that this transition will make our sales channels more efficient and broader reaching in the long term in these markets, there is no guarantee that this new distribution model will increase our sales in the short term or allow us to sustain our gross margins. Any potential delays or confusion during the transition process to our new partners may negatively affect our relationship with our existing end customers and channel partners and may cause us to lose prospective end customers or additional business from existing end customers or cause a decline in renewal rates with existing end customers. Upon completion of the transition to the new sales model, we will be more reliant on fewer channel partners, which may reduce our contact with our end customers making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our software, support ongoing end customer requirements, estimate end customer demand, respond to evolving end customer needs, and obtain subscription renewals from end customers.\n\n25\n\n\n  Substantially all of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. Government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our channel partners for convenience or due to a default. If a material portion of government contracts becomes subject to renegotiation or termination, any such renegotiation or termination may adversely impact our future operating results. We also sometimes rely on our channel partners to satisfy certain regulatory obligations that we would otherwise have to satisfy if we sold directly to the government entities, and our channel partners may be unable or unwilling to satisfy these obligations in the future. In addition, a channel partner may become restricted in its ability to conduct business with government entities due to its own regulatory or legal issues. If we are unable to transition to another qualified channel partner in a timely manner, our ability to sell to government entities could be negatively impacted. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ (including subcontractors') administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our solutions, our channel partners changing their business models or refusing to continue to sell our solutions under current models, a reduction of revenue or fines, or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities.\n\nIf our indirect distribution channel is disrupted, particularly if we are reliant on a fewer number of channel partners, or if we are required to directly satisfy certain regulatory obligations imposed by government entities as a result of our efforts to expand our sales to government entities, we may be required to devote more time and resources to distribute our solutions directly and support our end customers, which may not be as effective and could lead to higher costs, reduced revenue and growth that is slower than expected.\n\nOur operating results and key financial and performance metrics may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\n\nOur operating results and key financial and performance metrics, including revenue, ARR, and free cash flow, may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. If our operating results or any of our key financial and performance metrics in any particular period fall below analyst or investor expectations, the market price of our securities would likely decline, potentially significantly. Factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\n•the timing and magnitude of bookings, and the license start dates of subscriptions in any quarter as well as the timing of ARR and/or GAAP revenue recognition associated with those transactions, which may diverge due to a variety of factors;\n\n•subscription renewal rates;\n\n•the timing of subscription renewals, such as subscription renewals that occur earlier than expected, which may have the effect of moving expected bookings and revenue from future periods to the current period;\n\n•our ability to attract new end customers and retain and increase sales to existing end customers;\n\n•disruptions in our sales channels or shifts in our relationships with important channel, OEM, ecosystem and cloud partners, and changes in their go-to-market priorities, incentive structures or terms;\n\n•the timing of revenue recognition for our sales;\n\n•reductions in end customers’ budgets for information technology purchases;\n\n•delays in end customers’ purchasing cycles or deferments of end customers’ purchases in anticipation of new products or updates from us or our competitors;\n\n26\n\n\n  •fluctuations in demand and competitive pricing pressures for our solutions;\n\n•the lengths of our contract durations;\n\n•the mix of solutions sold, and the mix of revenue between product and support, entitlements and other services;\n\n•our ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new solutions and product enhancements that meet customer requirements, and market acceptance of such new solutions and product enhancements;\n\n•the timing of product releases or upgrades or announcements by us or our competitors;\n\n•any change in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including consolidation or partnerships among our competitors or partners, new entrants, shifts in customer preferences, or discounting of prices;\n\n•the amount and timing of expenses to grow our business and the extent to which we are able to take advantage of economies of scale or to leverage our relationships with OEM or channel partners;\n\n•the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integrating and consolidating the results of acquired businesses;\n\n•the amount and timing of stock-based compensation expenses incurred as a result of granting equity awards to attract, retain, and motivate employees and key personnel;\n\n•our ability to control the costs of our solutions and their key components, or to pass along any cost increases to our end customers;\n\n•general economic, industry and market conditions and other events that may be outside of our control, such as political and social unrest, terrorist attacks, hostilities, war, malicious human acts, climate change, natural disasters (including extreme weather), supply chain disruption or shortages, pandemics or other major public health concerns, and other similar events; and\n\n•future accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting policies, and changes in how we define or calculate key performance metrics.\n\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our operating results in any particular quarter, which could cause the price of our securities to decline.\n\n27\n\n\n  Because a significant portion of our revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contractual service period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.\n\nSubscription revenue accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue, comprising 93%, 94%, and 95% of our total revenue for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. A significant portion of our subscription revenue is revenue from software entitlement subscriptions, support subscriptions and SaaS offerings, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. As a result, a significant portion of our revenue that we report for each fiscal quarter represents the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Consequently, any decline in any such subscriptions, whether new subscriptions or renewals, in any given fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. However, any such decline will negatively affect our revenue for future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market acceptance of our services, or a decrease in retention rates may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it more difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as a significant portion of our revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription duration.\n\nOur gross and operating margins are impacted by a variety of factors and may be subject to variation from period to period.\n\nOur gross and operating margins may be affected by a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the pricing of our products (including as a result of competitive pricing pressures or increases in component pricing), the degree to which we are successful in selling the value of incremental feature improvements and upgrades, customer renewal rates and the degree to which renewals drive our top-line growth, changes in the mix between direct versus indirect sales, changes in the mix of products sold, and the timing and amount of recognized and deferred revenue, particularly as a result of our subscription-based business model. In addition, operating margin may be affected by changes in our cost structure, including investments in sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative functions, as well as the timing of those investments relative to revenue recognition. If we are unable to manage these factors effectively, our gross and operating margins may decline, and fluctuations in these metrics may make it difficult to manage our business and to maintain profitability, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n28\n\n\n  Because our business depends on manufacturers of hardware, including our OEM partners, to timely and cost-effectively produce and ship the hardware platforms on which our software runs, we are susceptible to supply chain disruptions, delays, quality events, and pricing fluctuations, which have adversely affected, and could further adversely affect, our business.\n\nOur business depends on manufacturers (including Supermicro and our OEM partners) to produce the hardware platforms on which our software runs (including both the Nutanix-branded NX series hardware platforms and the various third-party hardware platforms that are included on our hardware compatibility list) as well as various products that are beyond our control or the control of such manufacturers, which exposes us to direct and indirect risks beyond our control, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product availability, supply chain disruptions and delays, and potential reputational harm and brand damage. We may not be able to discover, manage, and/or remediate such risks in a timely manner or at all. Key components of the servers on which our software runs have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by chip shortages. In addition, increases in hardware prices, whether due to component shortages or other cost pressures, could reduce customer demand for our software if customers delay or scale back purchases of certified hardware platforms needed to run our solutions. Customers may also respond to rising hardware costs by reevaluating their overall IT budgets or seeking to reduce total solution costs, which could adversely affect demand for our software and put pressure on pricing and margins. Furthermore, fulfilling orders for NX series hardware platforms or other hardware platforms on which our software runs may not be a priority for such manufacturers in guiding their business decisions and operational commitments. If we fail to manage our relationships with such manufacturers effectively, or if such manufacturers experience delays, disruptions or increased manufacturing lead times, component lead-time disruptions, capacity constraints, or quality control problems in their operations or are unable to address our or our end customers’ requirements for or concerns about timely delivery, our ability to sell our solutions to our end customers could be severely impaired due to the lack of availability of certified hardware platforms, and our customers' ability, or willingness, to consume our software may be materially impacted or delayed, which could adversely affect our business and operating results, competitive position, brand and reputation, as well as our relationships with affected customers.\n\nIn particular, we rely substantially on Supermicro to manufacture, as well as assemble and test, the Nutanix-branded NX series hardware platforms. Our agreement with Supermicro automatically renews for successive one-year periods, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal, and does not contain any minimum long-term commitment to manufacture NX-branded hardware platforms. If we are required to change the manufacturer or contract manufacturers for the assembly and testing of our NX-branded hardware platforms, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs and damage our channel partner and end customer relationships. We may also decide to switch or bring on additional contract manufacturers for the assembly and testing of our NX-branded hardware platforms in order to better meet our needs. Switching to or bringing on a new OEM partner or contract manufacturer and commencing production can be expensive and time-consuming and may cause delays in order fulfillment at our existing OEM partners and contract manufacturers or cause other disruptions.\n\nOur agreement with Supermicro does not contain any price assurances, and increases in component costs, without a corresponding increase in the price of our NX series solutions, could reduce the amount that an end customer pays for our software, thereby adversely affecting our revenue. Furthermore, we may need to increase our component purchases, manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions if we experience increased demand. The inability of Supermicro or other manufacturers to produce adequate supplies of hardware platforms could cause a delay in customers’ ability to consume our software and our order fulfillment, and our business, operating results and prospects, would be adversely affected. As of July 31, 2025, we had approximately $106.9 million in the form of guarantees to our contract manufacturers related to certain components.\n\n29\n\n\n  There are a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, for several key components in our NX-branded hardware platforms as well as other hardware platforms that our software is certified to operate on (including hardware platforms from our OEM partners), and any delay or disruption in the availability or quality of these components could delay shipments of the NX-branded hardware platforms and damage our channel partner or end customer relationships, or cause our customers to delay purchasing our software.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, for several key hardware components of the Nutanix-branded NX series hardware platforms. These components are generally purchased on a purchase order basis through Supermicro, and we do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. This reliance on key suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over product quality, production and component costs, timely delivery, and capacity. It also exposes us to the potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components because we do not have long-term supply commitments, and replacing some of these components would require a lengthy product qualification process. Furthermore, we extensively test and qualify the components that are used in NX-branded hardware platforms and other platforms on our hardware compatibility list, including hardware platforms from our OEM partners, to ensure that they meet certain quality and performance specifications. If the supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, or if there is a need to replace existing suppliers on the qualified hardware configuration, there can be no assurance that additional supplies or components can serve as adequate replacements for the existing components, will be available when required or that supplies will be available on terms that are favorable, and it may require modifying our solutions to interoperate with the replacement components. Any of these developments could extend the lead times, increase the costs of the components or costs of product development, cause us to miss market windows for product launch and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe generally maintain minimal inventory for repairs and a number of evaluation and demonstration units, and generally acquire components only as needed. We do not enter into long-term supply contracts for these components. As a result, our ability to respond to channel partner or end customer orders efficiently may be constrained by the then-current availability, terms and pricing of these components. The technology industry has experienced component shortages and delivery delays in the past, including a global chip shortage, and there may be shortages or delays of critical components in the future as a result of strong demand in the industry, component availability constraints, or other factors. If we or our suppliers inaccurately forecast demand for our solutions or we ineffectively manage our enterprise resource planning processes, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could increase the prices we must pay for substitute components or result in our inability to meet demand for our solutions, as well as damage our channel partner or end customer relationships.\n\nIf the suppliers of the components of compatible hardware platforms increase prices of components, experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or adverse changes to their financial condition, our ability to ship hardware platforms to our channel partners or end customers in a timely manner and at competitive prices could be impaired, and our customers' ability to acquire hardware on which to run our software could be impaired, and our competitive position, brand, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected. Qualifying a new component can be expensive and time-consuming. If we are required to change key suppliers, we may lose revenue and damage our channel partner or end customer relationships which could adversely impact our revenue and operating results.\n\n30\n\n\n  We rely upon third parties for the warehousing and delivery of hardware platforms and replacement parts for support, and we therefore have less control over these functions than we otherwise would.\n\nWe outsource the warehousing and delivery of hardware platforms and spare parts to a third-party logistics provider for spares and service parts fulfillment. In addition, some of our support offerings commit us to replace defective parts in our hardware platforms as quickly as four hours after the initial customer support call is received, which we satisfy by storing replacement parts inventory in various third-party supply depots in strategic worldwide locations. As a result of relying on third parties, we have reduced control over shipping and logistics transactions and costs, quality control, security, and the supply of replacement parts for support. Consequently, we may be subject to shipping disruptions and unanticipated costs as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our direct control. If we are unable to have hardware platforms or replacement products shipped in a timely manner, end customers may seek to cancel their contracts with us, we may suffer reputational harm, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to sell our solutions is dependent in part on ease of use and the quality of our technical support, and any failure to offer high-quality technical support would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nOnce our solutions are deployed, our end customers depend on our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our solutions. Furthermore, because of the emerging nature of our solutions, our support organization often provides support for and troubleshoots issues for products of other vendors running on our solutions, even if the issue is unrelated to our solutions. There is no assurance that we can solve issues unrelated to our solutions, or that vendors whose products run on our solutions will not challenge our provision of technical assistance to their products. Our ability to provide effective support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain personnel who are not only qualified to support our solutions, but also well versed in some of the primary applications and hypervisors that our end customers run on our solutions. Furthermore, as we have international operations, our support organization faces additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. In addition, as we continue to evolve our product portfolio, which may include additional solutions, our ability to provide high-quality support will become more difficult and will involve more complexity. Any failure to maintain high-quality installation and technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and brand, adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective end customers, and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nOur solutions are highly technical and may contain undetected defects, which could cause data unavailability, unauthorized access to, loss, or corruption that might, in turn, result in liability to our end customers and harm to our reputation, brand and business.\n\nOur solutions are highly technical and complex and are often used to store information critical to our end customers’ business operations. Our solutions may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities that could result in data unavailability, unauthorized access to, loss, corruption, or other harm to our end customers’ data, including personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers, and suppliers, as well as their finance and payroll data, and other sensitive business information. In addition, as we expand our platform and introduce new cloud-based products that may hold more of our customers’ data, any undetected or unresolved errors, defects or security vulnerabilities may result in data unavailability, unauthorized access to, loss, corruption, or other harm to our end-customers' data. Some errors or defects in our solutions may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by end customers. In addition, we may make certain commitments to our OEMs regarding the time frames within which we will correct any security vulnerabilities in our software. If any hardware or software errors, defects or security vulnerabilities are discovered in our solutions after commercial release, a number of negative effects in our business could result, including but not limited to:\n\n31\n\n\n  •lost revenue or lost OEM or other channel partners or end customers;\n\n•delays in developing and deploying patches and other remedial measures to adequately address vulnerabilities, if any;\n\n•increased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with end customer support as well as development costs to remedy the errors or defects;\n\n•delays, cancellations, reductions, or rescheduling of orders or shipments;\n\n•product returns or discounts; and\n\n•damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nIn addition, we could face legal claims for breach of contract, product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. While many of our contracts with end customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, these provisions might not be upheld or might not provide adequate protection if we face such legal claims. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and may divert management’s attention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our solutions. In addition, our business liability insurance coverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all. These product-related issues could result in claims against us and our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur business depends, in part, on sales to government organizations, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of such government organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. Government contracts may require the maintenance of certain security clearances for facilities and employees. However, demand is often unpredictable from government organizations, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the public sector. Government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT spending, particularly in light of continued uncertainties about government spending levels, such as recent changes to, or failure to appoint new, government leaders. We have also recently experienced longer sales cycles and increased variability in transactions involving federal government agencies, which we believe are due to internal personnel changes and more extensive procurement reviews within these organizations. The budget and approval process for government agencies also experiences a longer sales cycle relative to our other end customers, and it may be difficult for us to accurately forecast the impact of these contracts on our future operating results. If government organizations reduce or shift their capital spending patterns, our business, operating results and prospects may be harmed. Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the amount of revenue derived from government contracts, include, but are not limited to:\n\n•the elimination of certain government agencies;\n\n•public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations;\n\n•changes in fiscal or contracting policies;\n\n•decreases in available government funding;\n\n•changes in government programs or applicable requirements;\n\n32\n\n\n  •the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;\n\n•potential delays or changes in the government appropriations or other funding authorization processes; \n\n•delays caused by reductions in force in government agencies; and\n\n•higher expenses associated with, or delays caused by, diligence and qualifying or maintaining qualification as a government vendor.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\n\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows. \n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from end customers and channel partners outside the United States. We derived approximately 44%, 45% and 44% of our total revenue from our international customers based on bill-to location for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. As of July 31, 2025, approximately 59% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. We are subject to risks associated with having significant worldwide operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n•business practices may differ from those in the United States and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in customer, channel partner, employee, consultant, and other contracts;\n\n•political, economic and social instability or uncertainty around the world, including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and continued instability in the Middle East;\n\n•potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by, or statements made by, the U.S. government, including evolving trade policies and tariff regimes that may impact global supply chains and cross-border commerce;\n\n•the potential impact of tariffs or other trade restrictions imposed by, or threatened to be imposed by, the U.S. government, including newly introduced or adjusted tariffs under recent trade initiatives and reciprocal actions by other governments;\n\n•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, judgments and arbitration awards in international courts, and in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment and collection periods;\n\n•greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and tax laws and treaties;\n\n•risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification and localization of our solutions required in foreign countries;\n\n•greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\"FCPA\"), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (\"UK Bribery Act\"), U.S. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\n33\n\n\n  •heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;\n\n•requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance, including new and evolving laws governing AI and data privacy, such as the European Union's AI Act;\n\n•increased expectations from foreign customers and other stakeholders about our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors (such as climate-related performance), and requirements to comply with foreign sustainability standards or initiatives, including new sustainability standards and due diligence obligations in the European Union, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\"CSRD\") and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (\"CSDDD\");\n\n•reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\n•impediments to the flow of foreign exchange capital payments and receipts due to exchange controls instituted by certain foreign governments;\n\n•increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining corporate entities, office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\n•difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure and legal and regulatory compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including costs related to additional regulatory reviews or audits, financial accounting and reporting obligations and international cybersecurity requirements;\n\n•greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;\n\n•the challenge of managing a development team in geographically disparate locations;\n\n•management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n\n•differing employment practices and labor relations issues;\n\n•fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business; and\n\n•treatment of revenue from international sources for tax purposes and changes in tax laws, regulations or official interpretations, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding, income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nAs we expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. These factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition. The entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.\n\n34\n\n\n  Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property\n\nIf we are the victim of a cyber attack or other cybersecurity incident and our networks, computer systems or software solutions are breached or unauthorized access to sensitive or proprietary information, including employee or customer data, otherwise occurs, our business operations may be interrupted, our reputation and brand may be damaged, and we may incur significant liabilities.\n\nCyber attacks designed to gain access to sensitive or proprietary information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high-profile electronic security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents leading to the unauthorized release of sensitive or proprietary information, including employee and customer information, have occurred at a number of large companies in recent years. Companies in our industry have reported that they have been subject to such cyber attacks, including attacks potentially from nation-state actors, and we could be subject to similar attempted attacks. More generally, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become prevalent in our industry, particularly against cloud services, and we and companies like us can suffer security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents from a variety of causes, whether due to third-party action, software bugs or vulnerabilities or coding errors, physical break-ins, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. In addition, retaliatory acts by countries subject to Western sanctions could include cyber attacks that could disrupt the economy or that could also either directly or indirectly impact our operations. We also continue to incorporate AI solutions and features into our platform, which may result in security incidents, jailbreaking, or otherwise increase cybersecurity risks. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning may increase cybersecurity risks we face through, for example, being used to increase the prevalence or intensity of cyber attacks.\n\nWhile we regularly face a wide variety of attempted attacks and other cybersecurity incidents, our preventative and detective security systems and controls have protected us to-date from any such attack or incident having a significant impact on our business. However, there is no assurance that these systems and controls will prevent any future attacks or incidents that may have a significant impact on our business. As we transition to offering more cloud-based solutions, as well as those based on our partnerships with third-party public cloud providers, we and our third-party public cloud providers may increasingly be the target of cyber threats or be exposed to other types of cybersecurity incidents. We also use other third-party platforms and other services, and as a result, we have been exposed to in the past, and may be exposed to in the future, cybersecurity incidents related to such third-party services.\n\nBecause the techniques used and vulnerabilities exploited to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period.\n\nIf any unauthorized access to, or security breach of, or other cybersecurity incident affecting, our solutions occurs, such an event could result in the loss of data, loss of intellectual property or trade secrets, loss of business, severe reputational or brand damage adversely affecting end customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders and other enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, and penalties for violation of privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence, and other applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations. We may also be subject to potentially significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused or incentives offered to end customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach and other liabilities. Additionally, any such event or perceived event could impact our reputation and brand, harm customer confidence, hurt our sales and expansion into existing and new markets, or cause us to lose potential or existing end customers. Any actual, potential or anticipated attack or other cybersecurity incident may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.\n\n35\n\n\n  Furthermore, a high-profile security breach or incident suffered, or perceived to have been suffered, by an industry peer may entail a general loss of trust in our industry and thereby have a similar adverse impact on our business and financial performance as a direct breach suffered by us. We could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches or incidents and to remediate our systems, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, and our ability to operate our business may be impaired.\n\nIn addition, if the security measures of our end customers, partners, vendors, or suppliers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems or of our solutions used by such end customers, partners, vendors, or suppliers, we may face negative publicity, reputational harm or brand damage if our end customers, partners, vendors, or suppliers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such incidents to us or our solutions. If end customers believe that our solutions do not provide adequate security for the storage of personal or other sensitive or proprietary information or the transmission of such information over the internet, our business will be harmed. End customers’ concerns about security or privacy may deter them from using our solutions for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information, which may significantly affect our business and operating results.\n\nMoreover, we have acquired a number of companies, products, services, and technologies over the years. Although we devote significant resources to address any security issues with respect to such acquisitions, we may still inherit additional risks as we integrate these companies, products, services, and technologies into our business and solutions.\n\nThird-party claims that we are infringing intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business could be harmed.\n\nA number of companies, both within and outside of the enterprise and cloud computing infrastructure industry, hold a large number of patents covering aspects of storage, servers, networking, desktop, security, virtualization, containerization, database management, cloud services products, and other technologies relevant to our products. In addition to these patents, participants in these technology and market areas typically also protect their technology through copyrights, as trade secrets and by contractual means. As a result, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received, and in the future may receive, inquiries from other intellectual property holders and may become subject to allegations and claims, in litigation and outside litigation, that we infringed or are infringing their intellectual property rights, particularly as we expand our presence in the market and face increasing competition. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or claims or in reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us, which could affect or even preclude our ability to sell our products in the relevant market and subject us to payment of damages and other financial remedies. In addition, parties may claim that the names and branding that we use for our company and our various products and services infringe their trademark rights in certain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail, we may have to change the names and branding that we use in the affected countries or territories and we could incur other costs.\n\n36\n\n\n  We currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our end customers, suppliers and channel and other partners from damages and costs which may arise from allegations of infringement, or actual infringement, by our products and services of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights in the United States and/or in other countries. The scope of these defense and indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. A claim that our solutions infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could harm our relationships with our end customers and/or channel partners, may deter future end customers from purchasing our solutions and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party relating to infringement by our products or services, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our solutions against intellectual property infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\n\nOur defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against us or our end customers, suppliers and channel partners, regardless of whether the claims have merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention, and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments. Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering or delivering our products and services to our end customers or channel partners and may require that we procure or develop substitute solutions that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. We may have to seek a license for the technology at issue, which may not be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all, and as a result may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions and covenants, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours and reduce our sales or market advantages, or infringe our intellectual property. A reduction in our market advantages or an inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nWe cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.\n\n37\n\n\n  Protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, solutions and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly internationally. Litigation via court proceedings, arbitrations or similar proceedings may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. For example, in March 2024, we announced that we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Tessell, Inc. (\"Tessell\") alleging that Tessell engaged in willful copyright and patent infringement (including theft of our source code and intellectual property related to our database service offering) and commenced separate arbitration proceedings against Tessell’s founders. Litigation and arbitration are unpredictable and we may not win a litigation or arbitration even if there is significant evidence supporting our claims and defenses. Further, these proceedings and any other similar proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defending intellectual property infringement claims and to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part.\n\nA number of our solutions incorporate or are based upon software  that we obtained under open source licenses, some of which may restrict or impose certain obligations on how we use or distribute our solutions, subject us to various risks and challenges and could result in increased development expenses, delays or disruptions to the release or distribution of those solutions, an inability to protect our intellectual property rights, and increased competition.\n\nA number of our solutions incorporate or are based upon open source software, and we may incorporate or base our solutions on open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed under “permissive” and “copyleft” open source licenses, such as the Apache License 2.0, BSD 2-Clause License, Eclipse Public License 2.0, GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, MIT License, the Mozilla Public License 2.0, and other open source licenses. The use of open source software subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including, but not limited to:\n\n•If open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, do not continue to develop and enhance open source technologies, our development expenses could increase and our product release and upgrade schedules could be delayed.\n\n•Open source software is open to further development or modification by anyone. As a result, others may develop such software to be competitive with our platform and may make such competitive software available as open source. It is also possible for competitors to develop their own solutions using open source software, potentially reducing the demand for, and putting price pressure on, our solutions.\n\n38\n\n\n  •The licenses under which we license certain open source software may require that, if we modify and distribute the open source software we receive, we are required to make such modifications and potentially related proprietary software of ours, available under the same open source license terms. In addition, some open source licenses treat provision of cloud services as triggering the requirement to make proprietary software publicly available. Sometimes, open source licensors may change their license in a way that may require us to change or eliminate the future use of such software, which may impact functionality and induce costs. Accordingly, we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our proprietary software to such conditions and others we do not intend. Although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various licenses for open source software that we use, our processes used to monitor how open source software is used and what license applies could be subject to error. In addition, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of terms in most of these licenses and licensors sometimes change their license terms. Therefore, any improper or unintended usage of open source software, including a failure to identify changes in license terms, could result in unanticipated obligations regarding our solutions and technologies, which could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and our ability to derive revenue from solutions incorporating the open source software.\n\n•If an author or other third party who distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur legal expenses defending against such allegations, or engineering expenses in developing a substitute solution.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our compliance obligations for open source software use, our business and operating results could be adversely affected and our development costs may increase.\n\nRisks Related to Employee Matters\n\nOur business and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including our management team and other key personnel, and the inability to attract, hire, integrate, train, retain, or motivate qualified personnel could harm our business and growth.\n\nOur success and growth depend to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team and other key personnel. If we lose the services of any member of management or any key personnel, we may encounter challenges or delays in identifying a suitable or qualified replacement, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train a replacement. In recent years, we have experienced changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and other key personnel. While we seek to manage these transitions carefully, these changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and may cause disruptions to our business and growth. If we fail to successfully integrate new key personnel into our organization or if key employees are unable to successfully transition into new roles, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we do not have life insurance policies that cover any of our executive officers or other key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could disrupt our business and have a significant negative impact on our operating results, prospects and future growth.\n\n39\n\n\n   In addition, our success and growth also depend substantially on our ability to continue to attract, hire, integrate, train, retain, and adequately motivate qualified and highly skilled personnel, in particular, in sales and engineering. We have invested, and may need to continue to invest, significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Moreover, ineffective management of any leadership transitions, especially within our sales organization, or the inability of our recently hired sales personnel to effectively ramp to target productivity levels could negatively impact our growth and operating margins. It requires a significant time investment to replace, train, and ramp sales representatives to full productivity. Competition for highly skilled personnel, particularly in sales and engineering, is frequently intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we are headquartered and have a substantial need for engineering talent. This competition for highly skilled personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. Furthermore, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition.\n\nAlthough we have entered into employment offer letters with some of our key personnel, these agreements generally do not have a fixed duration or term. Volatility or underperformance in the price of our Class A common stock may also impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Additionally, potential changes in U.S. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nMoreover, we believe that a key contributor to our success and our ability to retain a highly skilled workforce has been our company culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, and a passion for our products and customers. As we grow and evolve, we may find it difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our company culture globally. These difficulties may be further amplified by our globally distributed workforce, which could have a negative impact on our workplace culture and on the execution of our business plans and operations. An inability to maintain our company culture could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees, continue to perform at current levels, or execute on our business strategy.\n\nIf we do not effectively expand, train, motivate, and retain our sales force, we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected.\n\nAlthough we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective end customers. Therefore, we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new end customers and sell additional solutions to our existing end customers. There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity; we estimate based on past experience that our average sales team members typically do not fully ramp and are not fully productive until around the time of the start of their fourth quarter of employment with us. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals, particularly individuals who are focused on sales of our solutions to new and existing large enterprises, service providers and government entities, in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. Hiring sales personnel in new countries also requires additional set up, upfront and ongoing costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. In addition, as a result of our rapid growth, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and our solutions and therefore less effective than our more seasoned employees. \n\n40\n\n\n  If our new sales employees, particularly those focused on sales of our solutions to new and existing large enterprises, service providers and government entities, do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected, or if we are unable to ensure that our seasoned sales employees remain productive, our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve long-term projections may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to hire, train and maintain sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or our new or existing sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new end customers, convincing existing customers to renew their subscription-based purchases, or increasing sales to our existing customer base generally, our business, operating results and prospects will be adversely affected.\n\nIf we do not effectively develop, structure and compensate our sales force to focus on the end customers and activities that will primarily drive our growth strategy, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nAs indicated above, our growth is dependent in large part on the success of our sales force and in particular our ability to structure our sales force and sales compensation structure in a way that aligns with our growth strategy. As part of our efforts to appropriately structure and compensate our sales force such that their incentives are properly aligned with our growth strategy, we have made changes to our sales processes, sales segmentation, and leadership structures for our global sales teams and may need to make additional changes in the future. Such changes may take longer than anticipated to successfully implement, and we may not be able to realize the full benefits thereof, which may have a material adverse impact on our sales productivity as well as our business and operational results generally. In particular, as indicated above, our growth continues to be substantially dependent on our ability to increase our sales to large enterprises, particularly when those sales result in large orders for our solutions. Competition for sales employees who have the knowledge and experience necessary to effectively penetrate major enterprise accounts is fierce, and we may not be successful in hiring such employees, or hiring them on the timelines we anticipate, which will negatively impact our ability to target and penetrate major enterprise accounts.\n\nRisks Related to Financial, Accounting, Regulatory, Tax, and Other Legal Matters\n\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. \n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.\n\n41\n\n\n  Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our securities.\n\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to comply with the SEC rules that implement Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have expended and anticipate that we may continue to expend significant resources and undertake various actions, including incurring accounting-related costs, implementing new internal controls and procedures, and providing significant management oversight. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our securities. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n\nAny legal proceedings or claims we may be involved in, including securities class action litigation that could result from volatility in our stock price, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of their outcome.\n\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and claims, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, commercial matters, employee-related claims, and other actions, including actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation, whether meritorious or not, could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources from our business, and adversely impact our reputation and brand. This could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. If we are required to make substantial payments or implement significant changes to our operations as a result of legal proceedings or claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, companies that experience volatility in their stock price, including us, have historically been subject to securities class action and derivative litigation and we may face similar claims in the future. For example, class action securities lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against us in February 2019 and March 2023, which have since been resolved. Any such litigation instituted against us, whether meritorious or not, could result in substantial costs, divert management’s attention, and adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n42\n\n\n  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and reputational harm and could also cause us to lose end customers, including in the public sector, or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector.\n\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, including those related to employment and labor, antitrust, workplace safety, environmental, consumer protection, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, trade and economic sanctions, securities, and taxation. In certain jurisdictions, these legal and regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in third-party professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state and local governmental organizations, which affect how we and our channel partners do business with governmental agencies. Selling our solutions to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including meeting the compliance requirements necessary for maintaining any required security clearances for facilities and employees. Failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines and other penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has recently identified procurement fraud as an enforcement priority, indicating an ongoing commitment to aggressive enforcement under the False Claims Act and other applicable laws. Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nThese laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including noncompliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property, and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions, or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nWe are subject to stringent and rapidly changing laws, regulations, industry standards and frameworks, and other obligations related to privacy, artificial intelligence, data protection, and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any inability to comply with such obligations could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\n\nPrivacy, artificial intelligence, data protection, and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy, artificial intelligence, and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of global laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and various state, local and foreign bodies, data protection authorities, and agencies.\n\n43\n\n\n  The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and transfer of personal information of individuals, including end customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including in Australia, Brazil, the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), the UK, Switzerland, India, Japan, China, and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados (\"LGPD\"), impose more stringent data protection requirements, provide an enforcement authority which substantially increases compliance costs, and impose large penalties for noncompliance. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, conduct transfer and privacy impact assessments, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, among others, obtain individuals’ consent to use personal information for certain purposes. In addition, some countries have enacted, or are currently considering, legislation that requires local storage and processing of data to avoid any form of transfer to a third country, or other restrictions on transfer and disclosure of personal data outside of that country which may impact our compliance obligations, potentially exposing us to liability, and increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.\n\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, industry standards, and case law concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EEA and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact these developments may have on our business. This increases uncertainty and may require us to change our data practices and/or change our technology solutions, business model or processes, which may in turn adversely affect demand for our products. Additionally, our sales cycles may lengthen due to increasingly rigorous and complex customer-driven security, artificial intelligence, and privacy assessments as part of customers’ purchasing decisions.\n\nWhile the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework accepted by the European Commission in July 2023 (as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPF) provides us with a transfer mechanism for data from the EEA, data transfers continue to be scrutinized by regulators in the EEA, the UK and other countries with similar transfer restrictions requiring organizations to ensure that the data is protected to a standard that is \"essentially equivalent\" to that under the GDPR, UK GDPR, Swiss Federal Data Protection Act, and/or other applicable laws and to document this.\n\nAs a result of these and future data transfer developments, we may experience a reluctance from current or prospective customers in the EEA, the UK, Switzerland, and other similar countries to use our products and may find it necessary to make changes to our data transfer mechanisms and handling of personal data, including with respect to the provision of our products and services. This may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n44\n\n\n  In the United States, more states are adopting their own data protection legislation, creating a complex privacy landscape from state to state. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt out of the sale of their personal information. The California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") generally expanded consumers’ privacy rights and protections with respect to their personal information. Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, Florida, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Tennessee all have passed privacy legislation now in effect. We cannot yet predict the full impact of these laws on our business or operations, but it may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\n\nMoreover, as a result of current and proposed data protection and privacy laws addressing the use of personal data for marketing purposes, including the European Commission’s draft ePrivacy Regulation, which is intended to replace the ePrivacy Directive in the EEA, as well as the CCPA/CPRA and other U.S. state privacy laws, we face increased difficulty in marketing to current and potential customers, as these laws impact the ability to use internet-based services and tracking technologies, such as cookies, which impacts our ability to spread awareness of our products and services and, in turn, grow a customer base in some regions. We also expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of these laws.\n\nAs we begin to offer more cloud-based services, we will increasingly be positioned as a data processor, which imposes additional obligations under the foregoing and other laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection and may increase our liability exposure by operation of law, contract, or penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, we expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted in new ways in the future. Current or future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could impair our or our customers’ ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our solutions, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.\n\nAlthough we are working to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards, and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our solutions. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation and brand, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n45\n\n\n  Failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\n\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the UK Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we use various third parties to sell our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, or state-owned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We continue to update and implement our FCPA/anti-corruption compliance program and no assurance can be given that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\n\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other third-party professional fees.\n\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\n\nOur solutions are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our solutions. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations.\n\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to the U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the export of certain products and services without the required export authorizations, including to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions. Additionally, the U.S. government has recently been critical of existing trade agreements and may impose more stringent export and import controls. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities even if the export license ultimately may be granted. While we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our encryption products, implementing IP address blocking and screenings against U.S. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers could be imposed for criminal violations of these laws.\n\n46\n\n\n  We also note that if our channel, alliance and OEM partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements into our relevant partner agreements; however, no assurance can be given that our partners will be able to comply with such requirements.\n\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Changes in our solutions or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets, prevent our end customers with international operations from deploying our solutions globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, including the escrow and government recovery of private encryption keys. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, increased export and import controls stemming from U.S. government policies, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential end customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\n\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, and we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our products and services in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our end customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur international operations may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\n\nWe have expanded our international operations and staff to better support our growth into the international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate the business flows and future growth into the international markets, and consider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, change in our geographical earnings mix, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to the intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.\n\n47\n\n\n  Changes in global tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\n\nGlobal tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact on our business, cash flow from operating activities, or financial results. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we comply with the law, which could affect our results of operations in the period issued. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reached agreement among various countries to implement a global minimum tax framework, commonly referred to as Pillar Two, which imposes a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals. The potential effects of Pillar Two may vary depending on specific provisions and rules implemented by each country that adopts Pillar Two. These changes may increase our tax obligations in these countries. In addition, several countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes, many of which would apply to revenues derived from digital services. We will continue to assess the ongoing impact of these current and pending changes to global tax legislation and the impact on our future financial statements upon the finalization of laws, regulations and additional guidance. In addition, as we continue to evaluate our corporate structure, any changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could also change our plans regarding reinvestment of such earnings. Due to the large scale of our U.S. and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have an adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow or financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are under audit by various tax authorities, which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our income and non-income-based tax returns. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\n\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\nIn general, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\"NOLs\"), and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. An ownership change occurs when a company’s \"five-percent shareholders\" (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Similar limitations may apply for state tax purposes. If our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited.\n\n48\n\n\n  Risks Related to Our Convertible Notes and Credit Facility\n\nAs of July 31, 2025, we had outstanding $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") and $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes, collectively, the “Notes”). As of July 31, 2025, we also had outstanding a revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolver\") that provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million.\n\nServicing and repaying our indebtedness, including the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and any borrowings under the Revolver, may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash to pay our indebtedness.\n\nAs of July 31, 2025, we had outstanding $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes and $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum (with such interest payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1), and the 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum (with such interest payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15). In addition, any borrowings under the Revolver will bear interest at a base rate, a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate or an alternative currency term rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon our total leverage ratio, payable at regular intervals as set forth in the Revolver. \n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments in respect of, or to refinance our, indebtedness may depend on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not be able to generate cash flows from operations in the future that are sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, restructuring debt, or selling assets. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Higher prevailing interest rates and/or a tightening supply of credit would adversely affect the terms upon which we would be able to refinance our indebtedness, if at all. As a result, we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, the Revolver contains restrictive covenants that limit us, and any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit or prohibit us, in each case, from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which could result in the acceleration of our debt.\n\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\n•make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\n•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\n•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes;\n\n•subject us to risks associated with variable interest rates to the extent applicable to such indebtedness; and\n\n•make an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\n\n49\n\n\n  Any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\n\nWe may not have sufficient cash or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash, to repay the Notes at maturity, or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\n\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes of a series surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the Notes of such series being converted or at their maturity. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes of a series or to pay cash upon conversions of such Notes or at their maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes of a series at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay cash upon conversions of such Notes or at their maturity as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the applicable indenture could constitute an event of default under any such agreement. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness or to pay cash amounts due upon conversion, upon required repurchase or at maturity of the applicable series of the Notes.\n\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes or the 2029 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes are convertible under the circumstances described in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes or the 2029 Notes is triggered, holders of such Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Notes of a series do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes of such series as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\n\nThe accounting method for the Notes, which may be settled in cash upon conversion, has had, and may continue to have, a material effect on our reported or future financial results.\n\nWe utilize the if-converted method for our diluted earnings per share calculation, the effect of which is that the transaction is accounted for as if the outstanding Notes were to be converted into shares of our Class A common stock at the respective conversion rate in the beginning of the respective period, even if the Notes of a series are not yet then convertible and even if, upon any conversion of any Notes of a series, we may elect to settle the conversion using cash or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\n\n50\n\n\n  Our revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant and other covenants that may restrict our actions, and a failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nIn February 2025, we entered into the Revolver. The Revolver includes covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell substantially all of our assets, make restricted payments, undergo certain fundamental changes, and prepay subordinated debt. In addition, the Revolver contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, calculated as set forth in the Revolver and tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The Revolver contains various events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, and events constituting a change of control, in each case subject to thresholds and cure periods as set forth in the Revolver. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of such an event of default, our lenders would have the right to terminate their commitments and accelerate our obligations under the Revolver as well as exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the Revolver, the other loan documents and applicable law. If outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities \n\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may decline. \n\nThe market price of our securities has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our securities depends on a number of factors, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our securities. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our securities include the following:\n\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; \n\n•volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of high technology stocks; \n\n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\n•changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, including as a result of any current and future business model transitions, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\n•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or any failure to meet or exceed these projections;\n\n•announcements by us or our competitors of new products and solutions or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\n•public analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\n51\n\n\n  •rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\n•actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\n•actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\n•actual or threatened litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\n•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\n•rumored, announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies of or by us or our competitors;\n\n•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\n•any major changes in our management or our Board of Directors;\n\n•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\n•other events or factors which may be outside of our control, such as political and social unrest, terrorist attacks, hostilities, war, malicious human acts, climate change, natural disasters (including extreme weather), pandemics or other major public health concerns, and other similar events, or responses to these events.\n\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance. \n\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce the price that our securities might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public markets, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur (including public disclosure of sales contemplated by 10b5-1 trading plans), could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe have reserved a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock for issuance upon vesting or exercise of our equity compensation plans and upon conversion of the Notes.\n\nWe have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of our Class A common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans.\n\nWe may also issue our shares of Class A common stock or additional securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\n\n52\n\n\n  We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause the price of our securities to decline.\n\nFrom time to time, we release financial guidance in our earnings conference calls, earnings releases, investor presentations, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance includes forward-looking statements based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies on our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. Some of those key assumptions relate to the macroeconomic environment, including inflation and interest rates, which are inherently difficult to predict. Other assumptions relate to the timing and structure of customer payments. For example, while we typically invoice customers upfront for multi-year subscriptions, any change to this practice could affect the timing of our free cash flow.\n\nWe generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges, which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our actual business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, any of which or combination thereof could materially and adversely affect our business and future operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions to our previously announced guidance, if we withdraw our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance regarding future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our securities would decline.\n\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our securities.\n\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “Risk Factors” section could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\n\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our securities.\n\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion thereof, will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, reduce our earnings per share and potentially have an adverse effect on the price of our securities. Any sales in the public market of our Class A common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our securities. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our Class A common stock could depress the price of our securities.\n\n53\n\n\n  We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\nIn August 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of our Class A common stock, of which $111.5 million remained available for future share repurchases under the authorization as of July 31, 2025. In August 2025, our Board of Directors approved a $350.0 million increase to the share repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any minimum number of shares. The timing and amount of share repurchases will depend upon prevailing stock prices, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, and other factors. We cannot guarantee that the share repurchase program will be fully executed or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases under the program could affect, and increase the volatility of, the price of our Class A common stock and will diminish our cash reserves. In addition, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in August 2022, the United States implemented a 1% excise tax on the value of certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. This tax may increase the costs to us of any share repurchases. The program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, and any future announcement of a termination of the program could result in a decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.\n\nIf financial or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our securities, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. In addition, analyst research or reports may also raise performance expectations that we may not be able to meet. The stock prices of many companies in the high technology industry have declined significantly after those companies have failed to meet, or in some cases failed to significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet (or exceed) our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our securities or publish unfavorable research about us. If analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our securities or trading volume to decline, potentially significantly.\n\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors or current management and may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\n•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\n•the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\n•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\n54\n\n\n  •the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our Board of Directors, our lead independent director, our president, our secretary, or a majority vote of our Board of Directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\n•the ability of our Board of Directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\n•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nFurthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\n\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n55\n\n\n  We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nInvestors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\n\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, partners, employees, other stakeholders, and regulators concerning environmental, social and governance matters (\"ESG\"). Some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies, which may prove challenging if such standards diverge or even contradict.\n\nAs ESG best practices and reporting standards continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs relating to ESG monitoring and reporting and complying with ESG initiatives. For example, the SEC adopted climate change and ESG reporting requirements. Following several legal challenges, the SEC voted to end its defense of such rules. If, in the future, the SEC were to reverse its current position, our compliance costs would increase. We may also face greater costs to comply with new ESG standards or initiatives in the European Union. We publish an annual Impact Report, which reports, among other things, our greenhouse gas emissions and our efforts to manage our emissions. In addition, our annual Impact Report provides highlights of how we are supporting our workforce, including our efforts to foster culture and community. Our disclosures on these matters, or a failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting, may potentially harm our reputation and customer relationships. Due to new regulatory standards and market standards, certain new or existing customers, particularly those in the European Union, may impose stricter ESG guidelines or mandates for, and may scrutinize relationships more closely with, their counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles or increase our costs.\n\nFurthermore, if our competitors’ ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\n\n56\n\n\n  Our business is subject to the risks of natural disasters (including extreme weather), pandemics, man-made problems, and other similar events that may be outside of our control.\n\nSignificant natural disasters (such as earthquakes, fires, floods, and extreme weather), man-made problems (such as significant power outages, security breaches, acts of terrorism or war, civil unrest, or geopolitical turmoil), and other similar events that may be outside of our control could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results. For example, despite the implementation of network security measures, our networks also may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our solutions. Further, both our corporate headquarters and our contract manufacturer are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, natural disasters (including extreme weather) and man-made problems could cause disruptions in our or our end customers’ or channel partners’ businesses, our suppliers’ and manufacturers’ operations or the global economy as a whole. Epidemics, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other outbreaks of novel diseases or other major public health concerns could also cause disruptions in our or our end customers’ or channel partners’ businesses, our supply chain, our suppliers’ and manufacturers’ operations, or the global economy as a whole. We also rely on IT systems to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. We do not have a formal disaster recovery plan or policy in place and do not currently require that our manufacturing partners have such plans or policies in place. To the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of orders or impede our suppliers’ or our manufacturers’ ability to timely deliver our solutions and product components, or the deployment of our solutions, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We do maintain what we believe are commercially reasonable levels of business interruption insurance. However, such insurance may not adequately cover our losses in the event of a significant disruption in our business.\n\nWe may further expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies (or vice versa through divestitures), each of which may divert our management’s attention, resulting in additional dilution to our stockholders and consumption of resources that are necessary to sustain and grow our business.\n\nOur business strategy may, from time to time, include acquiring other complementary products, technologies or businesses or divesting certain products. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses in order to expand our solutions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\n\n57\n\n\n  These kinds of acquisitions, divestitures or investments may result in unforeseen expenditures and operating and integration difficulties, especially if the acquisitions, divestitures or investments are more complex in structure and scope, including due to the geographic location of the acquired company. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of companies that we may acquire, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us. We may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful. Acquisitions or divestitures may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources, require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business, and may be viewed negatively by our end customers, investors or securities analysts. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or divestiture transaction, including accounting charges. Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities and risks, and we may incur additional costs and expenses necessary to address an acquired company’s failure to comply with laws and governmental rules and regulations. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized in a timely manner, if at all, or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions, divestitures or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.\n\nOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars; therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the effective cost of our solutions for customers outside the United States, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. An increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, and Australian Dollar. We also have expenses in other currencies, which are smaller in magnitude but still subject to currency fluctuations. As a result, our total expense base is exposed to foreign exchange volatility. In particular, ongoing geopolitical instability and divergent fiscal and monetary policies across regions have caused, and may continue to cause, significant exchange rate volatility for the foreseeable future. If our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations continues to grow and we are unable to effectively hedge against this risk, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Additionally, such fluctuations may impair our ability to accurately forecast financial performance, particularly with respect to operating expenses and margins. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements or used derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. We continue to monitor our exposure and evaluate the potential benefits of implementing a hedging program.\n\n58\n\n\n  Our marketable securities portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks that could cause its value to decline significantly and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe maintain a portfolio of marketable securities through a professional investment advisor. The investments in our portfolio are subject to credit, liquidity, market-price, and interest-rate risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Under our corporate investment policy, we seek to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, avoid excessive credit concentrations, and capture a market rate of return. However, the portfolio’s value may decline due to changes in interest rates, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities in our portfolio, and other factors, including unexpected or unprecedented events such as health epidemics or pandemics. Even with diversification and ongoing risk-profile monitoring, we could experience significant losses or reduced liquidity. If we increase our holdings in these securities, our exposure to such risks would grow, potentially exacerbating any adverse impact.",
