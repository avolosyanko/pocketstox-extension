When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health’s fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our data and information systems, including systems powered by or incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences. \n\nThe volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. We depend on the integrity of the data in our information systems to implement new and innovative services, automate and deploy new technologies to simplify administrative processes and clinical decision making, price our products and services adequately, provide effective service to our customers and consumers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, provide timely payments to care providers, and accurately report our results of operations. In addition, increasing connectivity among technologies and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices and new tools and products that leverage AI/ML to improve the customer experience. We anticipate that fast-evolving AI/ML technologies, including generative AI, will play an increasingly important role in our information systems and customer-facing technology products. Our ability to protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with changes in information processing technology (including AI/ML), regulatory standards and changing customer preferences will require an ongoing commitment of significant development and operational resources. If these commitments fail to provide the anticipated benefits, if we are unable to successfully anticipate future technology developments, or if the cost to keep pace with the technological changes exceeds our estimates, we could be exposed to reputational harm and experience adverse effects on our business. \n\nWe may not successfully implement our initiatives to consolidate the number of systems we operate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities, integrate and enhance our systems and develop new systems to keep pace with recent regulations and changes in information processing technology. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs.\n\nSome of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nUncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and  health information technologies, including those powered by or incorporating AI/ML, may alter the competitive landscape or impose new compliance requirements and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in our markets.\n\nIf we or third parties we rely on sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in disruption to our operations or the disclosure of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, negative operational effects, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.\n\nWe routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks  and other security threats and have previously been, and may in the future be, subject to compromises of the information technology systems we use, information we hold, or information held on our behalf by third parties. For example, we previously reported our Change Healthcare business, which we had recently acquired, was subject to a cyberattack in 2024, in which the data involved contained protected health information or personally identifiable information.\n\nWhile we have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber threats to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents, we expect that we will continue to experience these incidents, some of which may negatively affect our business. Further, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, in part due to use of evolving AI/ML technologies (including generative AI), and because our businesses are changing as well, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and threats, timely detect data security \n\n11\n\n\nincidents or implement adequate preventive measures. Threat actors and hackers have previously been, and may in the future be, able to negatively affect our operations by penetrating our security controls and causing system and operational disruptions or shutdowns, accessing, misappropriating or otherwise compromising protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, and developing and deploying viruses, ransomware and other malware that can attack our systems, exploit any security vulnerabilities, and disrupt or shutdown our systems and operations. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise our information security controls. Our systems may also be vulnerable to financial fraud schemes, misplaced or lost data, error, malicious social engineering, or other events which could negatively affect the data or financial accounts, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. There have previously been and may be in the future heightened vulnerabilities due to recently-acquired or non-integrated businesses. We rely in some circumstances on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business. The operations of these vendors are subject to similar risks, but are outside our direct oversight and control.\n\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cybersecurity incident could be material. We have business continuation and resiliency plans which we maintain, update and test regularly in an effort to contain and remediate potential disruptions or cybersecurity events. If our remediation efforts are not successful, we may experience operational interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, compromises of our security measures or the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties, previously and in the future, could expose us or them to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, negative operational impacts, and loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\n\nIf we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other care and service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, some of our activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly and attract negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions which could diminish our bargaining power. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in an effort to mitigate these impacts. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care providers. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. They may also fail to provide us with the information we need to effectively conduct our businesses, such as information enabling us to estimate costs of care. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. \n\nSome providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these services and may institute litigation or arbitration relying on state and federal laws that define the compensation that must be paid to out-of-network providers in some circumstances.\n\n12\n\n\nThe success of some of our businesses depends on maintaining satisfactory relationships with employed, affiliated, and independently contracted physicians and joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. Our revenues could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or expand satisfactory relationships with physicians, to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following physician departures. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payer competitors.\n\nFurther, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nIf we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur businesses face significant competition in all of the markets in which we operate. In many geographies or product segments, our competitors have and may continue to have certain competitive advantages. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, among both our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among competitors may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, maintain or improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase our profitability. \n\nIn addition, our success in the health care marketplace and future growth depends on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. We may face risks from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in the affected markets. We could sustain competitive disadvantages and loss of market share if we fail to continue developing innovative care models, including by accelerating the transition of care to value-based models that achieve higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expand access to virtual and in-home care. If health care payers or providers are unwilling or unable to enter into value-based agreements with us, we may be unable to successfully establish or maintain the contractual or employment relationships necessary to achieve the quality and cost objectives we have for value-based contracting. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by any failure to develop and apply innovative technologies and other effective data and analytics capabilities or to provide services to our clients focused on these technologies and capabilities.\n\nOur business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if our reputation suffers harm, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.\n\nWe are routinely subject to various private party and governmental legal actions and investigations, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe are routinely made party to a variety of private party and governmental legal actions and investigations related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nLegal actions to which we are a party have included and in the future could include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by personnel at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the \n\n13\n\n\nenforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), matters related to our use of or alleged failure to adequately safeguard personal information or other proprietary data, claims related to alleged failure of our technology products to operate properly or fairly, contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, some of our pharmacy services operations are subject to clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. \n\nWe are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities.  Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. These actions involve significant defense costs and could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation. \n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved. Even in situations where we engage external insurers, our coverage may be disputed or may not be sufficient to cover the entirety of certain claims. We incur expenses to resolve these matters and current and future legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business, require us to potentially change the way we conduct our business, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses.\n\nOur business could suffer, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, if we fail to successfully manage our strategic alliances, or to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic objectives, including as a result of antitrust regulatory enforcement actions, such as those that have been brought against us in the past, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nSuccessful acquisitions also require us to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present risks different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. For example, we have experienced and in the future may encounter more acute information technology system vulnerabilities or different litigation risk profiles in recently acquired business than we have historically managed. We may be unable to address such vulnerabilities, inadequacies, differences, or failures soon after acquiring a business, which could undermine integration activities, delay launch of acquired products, and increase infrastructure risk. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business have exposed us in the past and may expose us in the future to legal challenges and investigations that could subject us to criminal fines or reputational harm. Even if we are ultimately successful in resolving these matters, defending such claims may be costly and result in negative publicity. If we cannot successfully integrate our acquired businesses and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n14\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events, which have had and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. \n\nLarge-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters, public health crises and other extreme events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and impair our ability to provide services to our clients and customers. In addition, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, and our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be affected and sustain a reduced capacity to handle demand for care. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enactment of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting availability of, or our ability to deliver, pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. \n\nOur sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. \n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be impaired by changes in our business practices and the terms of our relationships, including commission levels.\n\nOur businesses are subject to risks associated with unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have a range of impacts on the demand for our products and services. Such conditions also have caused and in future periods could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer particular coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and in the premium and fee revenues we generate. \n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could constrain state and federal budgets and result in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could negatively affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by impacting the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others.\n\nOur failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. \n\nWe depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse talents, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, to operate and expand our business. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. \n\n15\n\n\nOur investment portfolio may sustain losses which could adversely affect our profitability. \n\nMarket fluctuations could impair the value of our investment portfolio and our profitability. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the substantial majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2024. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. \n\nOur investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial or market conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it should become necessary for us to liquidate a material portion of our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. \n\nIf the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $130 billion, representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. \n\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, or other intellectual property, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could suffer. \n\nWe rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, intellectual property rights inherent in software are the subject of substantial litigation, and we expect our software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the health care-focused software industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing and operating costs. \n\nClaims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Business\n\nOur business activities in the United States and other countries are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nWe are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including regulations and licensure requirements related to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPAs. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our \n\n16\n\n\ninsurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations.\n\nSome of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of our contracts with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed to involve an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nSome of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine restrictions; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to achieve targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\n\nThe laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent and often unpredictable change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Additionally, changes in tax laws or unfavorable resolutions of exams could create additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe integration of entities we acquire into our businesses may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could compel us to change how we do business, renegotiate existing contracts and other arrangements, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, resolution of commercial disputes and other actions.\n\nWe also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for some regulated products and services and complete or integrate strategic transactions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on proposed rate increases to HHS on many of our products for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe also currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relationships with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-U.S. regulatory regimes, which vary by jurisdiction, encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers). Any foreign regulator or court may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators or courts. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating outside the United States, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage.\n\nThe health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate concerning industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation, and expose us to unexpected or unwarranted regulatory scrutiny.\n\n17\n\n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our expansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for \n\n18\n\n\npurposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Some of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in future periods could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS.\n\nWe have been and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers regarding, among other allegations, claims that we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Government investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted and in future periods could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nOur pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses.\n\nWe provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and in future periods may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration and Boards of Pharmacy. \n\nWe could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, as well as claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into prohibited transactions.\n\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements of our customer contracts. Additionally, legislative and regulatory action in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, as well as internationally, is emerging in the areas of AI/ML and automation. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. \n\nInternationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security, and AI/ML and automation in the European Union, UK, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers.\n\n19\n\n\nSome of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. \n\nHIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with specified privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. If HHS alleges or finds noncompliance with HIPAA privacy or security requirements, the allegations or findings could damage our reputation and subject us to monetary and other sanctions.\n\nThrough our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to affected customers and the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and could also result in significant fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nAs an enterprise, we increasingly rely on new and evolving technologies, including those powered by or incorporating AI/ML, as part of our internal operations and in the delivery of our products and services.  New technologies have potential and power to improve and optimize operational processes and clinical outcomes across the healthcare system, but also present ethical, technological, legal, regulatory and other risks. With respect to AI/ML, we have developed and implemented policies and procedures intended to promote and sustain responsible design, development, and use of AI/ML, consistent with industry best practices. Any inadequacy or failure in compliance with our responsible use of AI/ML policies and procedures or emerging laws, regulations and standards governing AI/ML use could cause our technology products not to operate as intended or to produce outcomes, including possible regulatory enforcement action or litigation that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. \n\nBecause we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \n\nNone. \n\n20\n\n\nITEM 1C.    CYBERSECURITY\n\nUnitedHealth Group manages cybersecurity and data protection through a continuously evolving framework. The framework allows us to identify, assess and mitigate the risks we face, and assists us in establishing policies and safeguards to protect our systems and the information of those we serve. \n\nOur cybersecurity program is managed by our Chief Digital and Technology Officer and our Chief Security Officer. The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of our cybersecurity program and is responsible for reviewing and assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity and data protection policies, procedures and resource commitment, including key risk areas and mitigation strategies. As part of this process, the Audit and Finance Committee receives regular updates from the Chief Digital and Technology Officer and the Chief Security Officer on critical issues related to our information security risks, cybersecurity strategy, supplier risk and business continuity capabilities. The Audit and Finance Committee has also added a leading cybersecurity incident and response firm to serve as its advisor on cybersecurity matters.\n\nThe Company’s framework includes an incident management and response program that continuously monitors the Company’s information systems for vulnerabilities, threats and incidents; manages and takes action to contain incidents that occur; remediates vulnerabilities; and communicates the details of significant threats and incidents to management, including the Chief Digital and Technology Officer and the Chief Security Officer, as deemed necessary or appropriate. Pursuant to the Company’s incident response plan, incidents are reported to the Audit and Finance Committee and appropriate government agencies and other authorities, as deemed necessary or appropriate, considering the actual or potential impact, significance and scope. \n\nWe require our third-party partners and contractors to handle data in accordance with our data privacy and information security requirements and applicable laws. We regularly engage with our suppliers, partners, contractors, service providers and internal development teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner and monitor system upgrades to mitigate future risk, and evaluate whether they employ appropriate and effective controls and continuity plans for their systems and operations. \n\nTo ensure that our program is designed and operating effectively, our infrastructure and information systems are audited periodically by internal and external auditors. We have obtained various certifications from industry-recognized certifying organizations as a result of certain external audits. We also perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to improve system security and address emerging security threats. Our internal audit team independently assesses security controls against our enterprise policies to evaluate compliance and leverages a combination of auditing and security frameworks to evaluate how leading practices are applied throughout our enterprise. Audit results and remediation progress are reported to and monitored by senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee. We also periodically partner with industry-leading cybersecurity firms to assess our cybersecurity program. These assessments complement our other assessment work by evaluating our cybersecurity program as a whole.\n\nWe complete an enterprise information risk assessment as part of our overall enterprise information security risk management assessment, which is overseen by our Chief Security Officer. This risk assessment is a review of internal and external threats that evaluates changes to the information risk landscape to inform the investments and program enhancements to be made in the future to rapidly respond and recover from potential attacks, including rebuild and recovery protocols for key systems. We evaluate our enterprise information security risk to address unexpected or unforeseen changes in the risk environment or our systems and the resulting impacts are communicated to the Company’s overall enterprise risk management program.\n\nWe believe our Chief Digital and Technology Officer and our Chief Security Officer have the appropriate knowledge and expertise to effectively manage our cybersecurity program. The Chief Digital and Technology Officer has experience leading enterprise digital transformation efforts for a large multinational corporation and held several leadership and growth positions at a global technology consulting and services firm before joining UnitedHealth Group. Our Chief Security Officer has more than 30 years of experience as a security professional in both the private and public sectors, including in law enforcement. Prior to joining UnitedHealth Group, he served in security leadership roles at several large multinational corporations and has additionally served on cybersecurity advisory boards for some of the largest corporations in the country.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, but there can be no assurance that any such risk will not materially affect the Company in the future. For further information about the cybersecurity risks we face, and potential impacts, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\n21\n\n\nITEM 2.    PROPERTIES \n\nWe own and lease real properties to support our business operations in the United States and other countries.

Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n•Optum Health;\n\n•Optum Insight;\n\n•Optum Rx; and\n\n•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nChange Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers. \n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser extent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals’ information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n24\n\n\nBusiness Trends\n\nOur businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\n\nPricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\n\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\n\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends.” Our 2025 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\n\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\n\nMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As expected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, which may continue in future periods. We also observed an upshift in hospital coding intensity and an acceleration in the prescribing of certain high-cost medications in early response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We expect these additional factors to continue into future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\n\nAs a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were approximately $640 million.\n\nMedicaid Redeterminations. Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remained well short of current care activity. We expect this gap between people’s health status and rates will narrow in 2025.\n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration. \n\nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the experience and health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.\n\n25\n\n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\nFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\nMedicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend. The Advance Notice for 2026 rates proposes an industry base rate increase also well short of forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\n\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\n\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023 and other financial results.\n\n•Consolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%. \n\n•UnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in commercial offerings, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations.\n\n•Earnings from operations of $32.3 billion compared to $32.4 billion last year.\n\n•Diluted earnings per common share was $15.51, impacted by the loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale.\n\n•Cash flows from operations were $24.2 billion.\n\n26\n\n\nRESULTS SUMMARY\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:\n\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nRevenues:\n\nPremiums$308,810 $290,827 $257,157 $17,983 6 %\n\nProducts50,226 42,583 37,424 7,643 18 \n\nServices36,040 34,123 27,551 1,917 6 \n\nInvestment and other income5,202 4,089 2,030 1,113 27 \n\nTotal revenues400,278 371,622 324,162 28,656 8 \n\nOperating costs:\n\nMedical costs264,185 241,894 210,842 22,291 9 \n\nOperating costs53,013 54,628 47,782 (1,615)(3)\n\nCost of products sold46,694 38,770 33,703 7,924 20 \n\nDepreciation and amortization4,099 3,972 3,400 127 3 \n\nTotal operating costs367,991 339,264 295,727 28,727 8 \n\nEarnings from operations32,287 32,358 28,435 (71)— \n\nInterest expense(3,906)(3,246)(2,092)(660)20 \n\nLoss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale(8,310)— — (8,310)nm\n\nEarnings before income taxes20,071 29,112 26,343 (9,041)(31)\n\nProvision for income taxes(4,829)(5,968)(5,704)1,139 (19)\n\nNet earnings15,242 23,144 20,639 (7,902)(34)\n\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(837)(763)(519)(74)10 \n\nNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$14,405 $22,381 $20,120 $(7,976)(36)%\n\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$15.51 $23.86 $21.18 $(8.35)(35)%\n\nMedical care ratio (a)85.5 %83.2 %82.0 %2.3 %\n\nOperating cost ratio13.2 14.7 14.7 (1.5)\n\nOperating margin8.1 8.7 8.8 (0.6)\n\nTax rate24.1 20.5 21.7 3.6 \n\nNet earnings margin (b)3.6 6.0 6.2 (2.4)\n\nReturn on equity (c)15.9 %27.0 %27.2 %(11.1)%\n\n________ \n\nnm = not meaningful\n\n(a)Medical care ratio (MCR) is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.\n\n(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders.\n\n(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people’s health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\n\n27\n\n\nOperating Cost Ratio\n\nThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to operating cost management and gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, partially offset by the impact of our direct response efforts to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and investments to support future growth.\n\nLoss on Sale of Subsidiary and Subsidiaries Held for Sale\n\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Brazil operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $7.1 billion, of which $4.1 billion related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a plan to sell its remaining South American operations, which were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $1.2 billion, of which $855 million related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses. \n\nReportable Segments\n\nSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information:\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nRevenues\n\nUnitedHealthcare$298,208 $281,360 $249,741 $16,848 6 %\n\nOptum Health105,358 95,319 71,174 10,039 11 \n\nOptum Insight18,757 18,932 14,581 (175)(1)\n\nOptum Rx133,231 116,087 99,773 17,144 15 \n\nOptum eliminations(4,389)(3,703)(2,760)(686)19 \n\nOptum\n\n252,957 226,635 182,768 26,322 12 \n\nEliminations(150,887)(136,373)(108,347)(14,514)11 \n\nConsolidated revenues$400,278 $371,622 $324,162 $28,656 8 %\n\nEarnings from operations\n\nUnitedHealthcare$15,584 $16,415 $14,379 $(831)(5)%\n\nOptum Health7,770 6,560 6,032 1,210 18 \n\nOptum Insight3,097 4,268 3,588 (1,171)(27)\n\nOptum Rx5,836 5,115 4,436 721 14 \n\nOptum\n\n16,703 15,943 14,056 760 5 \n\nConsolidated earnings from operations\n\n$32,287 $32,358 $28,435 $(71)— %\n\nOperating margin\n\nUnitedHealthcare5.2 %5.8 %5.8 %(0.6)%\n\nOptum Health7.4 6.9 8.5 0.5 \n\nOptum Insight16.5 22.5 24.6 (6.0)\n\nOptum Rx4.4 4.4 4.4 — \n\nOptum\n\n6.6 7.0 7.7 (0.4)\n\nConsolidated operating margin8.1 %8.7 %8.8 %(0.6)%\n\n28\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare\n\nThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business:\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic$74,489 $67,187 $63,599 $7,302 11 %\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global3,667 9,307 8,668 (5,640)(61)\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total78,156 76,494 72,267 1,662 2 \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\n\n139,482 129,862 113,671 9,620 7 \n\nUnitedHealthcare Community & State\n\n80,570 75,004 63,803 5,566 7 \n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare revenues$298,208 $281,360 $249,741 $16,848 6 %\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement:\n\n December 31,Change\n\n(in thousands, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nCommercial - domestic:\n\nRisk-based8,845 8,115 8,045 730 9 %\n\nFee-based20,885 19,200 18,640 1,685 9 \n\nTotal commercial - domestic29,730 27,315 26,685 2,415 9 \n\nMedicare Advantage7,845 7,695 7,105 150 2 \n\nMedicaid7,435 7,845 8,170 (410)(5)\n\nMedicare Supplement (Standardized)4,335 4,355 4,375 (20)— \n\nTotal community and senior19,615 19,895 19,650 (280)(1)\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical49,345 47,210 46,335 2,135 5 \n\nCommercial - global1,330 5,540 5,360 (4,210)(76)\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - medical50,675 52,750 51,695 (2,075)(4)%\n\nSupplemental Data:\n\nMedicare Part D stand-alone3,050 3,315 3,295 (265)(8)%\n\nUnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings, partially offset by decreased people served globally due to the sale of the Brazil operations and in Medicaid offerings due to redeterminations. Earnings from operations decreased due to Medicare Advantage funding reductions, the impacts of Medicaid redeterminations, member mix and incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, and the growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings.\n\nOptum\n\nTotal revenues increased due to growth at Optum Rx and Optum Health. Earnings from operations increased with growth at Optum Health and Optum Rx, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at Optum Insight. The results by segment were as follows:\n\nOptum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements. Earnings from operations increased due to gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, increased investment income and cost management initiatives, partially offset by Medicare Advantage funding reductions, costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements and medical care activity. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2024 compared to 103 million people as of December 31, 2023. \n\n29\n\n\nOptum Insight\n\nRevenues at Optum Insight decreased primarily due the business disruption impacts from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by growth in technology services. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to direct response costs and business disruption impacts related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions.\n\nOptum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients and growth in pharmacy services. Earnings from operations also increased due to operating cost efficiencies and supply chain initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,623 million and 1,542 million adjusted scripts in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nLiquidity\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally derived from earnings before noncash expenses. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n\n30\n\n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nSources of cash:\n\nCash provided by operating activities$24,204 $29,068 $26,206 $(4,864)\n\nIssuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments14,660 4,280 12,536 10,380 \n\nProceeds from common share issuances\n\n1,846 1,353 1,253 493 \n\nCustomer funds administered\n\n— — 5,548 — \n\nCash received for dispositions2,041 685 3,414 1,356 \n\nSales and maturities of investments, net of purchases525 — — 525 \n\nTotal sources of cash43,276 35,386 48,957 7,890 \n\nUses of cash:\n\nCash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, net of cash assumed(13,408)(10,136)(21,458)(3,272)\n\nCommon share repurchases(9,000)(8,000)(7,000)(1,000)\n\nCash dividends paid(7,533)(6,761)(5,991)(772)\n\nPurchases of property, equipment and capitalized software\n\n(3,499)(3,386)(2,802)(113)\n\nPurchases of investments, net of sales and maturities — (1,777)(6,837)1,777 \n\nPurchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests(280)(730)(176)450 \n\nLoans to care providers - cyberattack, net of repayments(4,519)— — (4,519)\n\nCustomer funds administered(1,560)(521)— (1,039)\n\nOther(3,312)(2,110)(2,737)(1,202)\n\nTotal uses of cash(43,111)(33,421)(47,001)(9,690)\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n\n(61)97 34 (158)\n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents, including cash within businesses held for sale $104 $2,062 $1,990 $(1,958)\n\nLess: cash within businesses held for sale(219)— — (219)\n\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(115)$2,062 $1,990 $(2,177)\n\n2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023 Cash Flows\n\nDecreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by CMS Medicare funding reductions, Change Healthcare cyberattack response actions, increased medical costs and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net sales and maturities of investments and cash received from dispositions, offset by loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, increased cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, decreased customer funds administered and increased share repurchases.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $77.1 billion included $25.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $800 million was available for general corporate use), $46.9 billion of debt securities and $4.9 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2024. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n31\n\n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. \n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n•Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n\n•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n\n•Purchase and other obligations. These include $11.5 billion, $2.4 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds, strategic transactions and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024.\n\n•Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n\n•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail. We do not have any material potential required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenants under our bank credit facilities.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nCredit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n\nMoody’sS&P GlobalFitchA.M. Best\n\n RatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlook\n\nSenior unsecured debtA2StableA+StableAStableAStable\n\nCommercial paperP-1n/aA-1n/aF1n/aAMB-1+n/a\n\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.\n\n32\n\n\nShare Repurchase Program. In June 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of Common Stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. As of December 31, 2024, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 33 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nDividends. In June 2024, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nPending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.\n\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs Payable\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.\n\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $700 million, $840 million and $410 million, respectively.\n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\n\nCompletion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.\n\n33\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2024: \n\nCompletion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\n\n(in millions)\n\n(0.75)%$973 \n\n(0.50)647 \n\n(0.25)322 \n\n0.25(321)\n\n0.50(640)\n\n0.75(958)\n\nMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024: \n\nMedical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\n\n(in millions)\n\n3%$1,264 \n\n2843 \n\n1421 \n\n(1)(421)\n\n(2)(843)\n\n(3)(1,264)\n\nThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nManagement believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2024 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, 2024 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $260 million. \n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n\nGoodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\n34\n\n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.\n\nFinancial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2024, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\n\n35\n\n\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $33 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2024, $27 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, $46 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $49 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.\n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\n\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities \n\n2 %$666 $537 $(4,151)$(8,866)\n\n1333 268 (2,182)(4,828)\n\n(1)(333)(252)2,082 5,831 \n\n(2)(666)(503)4,311 12,935 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities \n\n2%$688 $393 $(3,642)$(8,142)\n\n1344 196 (1,871)(4,444)\n\n(1)(344)(180)1,954 5,391 \n\n(2)(688)(360)3,964 11,992 \n\nNote: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.9 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of venture investments and employee savings plan related investments.\n\n36\n\n\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nPage\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No 34)\n\n38\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n40\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n41\n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n\n42\n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n\n43\n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n44\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n45\n\n1.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nMedical Care Services Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR) using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles.\n\nWe identified medical care services IBNR as a critical audit matter because it requires significant management assumptions in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions, and judgments in developing estimates for medical care services IBNR.\n\n38\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to medical care services IBNR included the following, among others:\n\n•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR for these services, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.\n\n•We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.\n\n•With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate IBNR for these services by:\n\n–Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods.\n\n–Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR for these services and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate.\n\n–Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2024 with dates of service in 2023 or prior.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nWe have

Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n2.Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\nRevenues \n\nPremiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.\n\n45\n\n\nProducts and Services\n\nFor the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\nMedical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and \n\n46\n\n\ndemographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\nCost of Products Sold \n\nThe Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments \n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. \n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. \n\nAssets Under Management \n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\nOther Current Receivables \n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. \n\n47\n\n\nThe Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $12.5 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets included pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $3.8 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software \n\nProperty, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. \n\nThe Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: \n\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment3 to 10 years\n\nBuildings35 to 40 years\n\nCapitalized software3 to 5 years\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nThe Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. \n\nThe Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nGoodwill \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital levels and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\nThere was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nOther Current Liabilities \n\nOther current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($13.7 billion and $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances.\n\n48\n\n\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\n\nThe Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred.\n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company’s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n(in millions)20242023\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period$4,498 $4,897 \n\nNet earnings174 188 \n\nAcquisitions33 122 \n\nRedemptions(280)(730)\n\nDistributions (125)(144)\n\nFair value and other adjustments23 165 \n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period$4,323 $4,498 \n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nNet Earnings Per Common Share \n\nThe Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. \n\n49\n\n\n3.    Investments\n\nA summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows:\n\n(in millions)AmortizedCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValue\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$4,600 $1 $(274)$4,327 \n\nState and municipal obligations7,357 2 (375)6,984 \n\nCorporate obligations24,391 56 (1,140)23,307 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities10,577 1 (994)9,584 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities2,890 2 (175)2,717 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale49,815 62 (2,958)46,919 \n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations444 — (2)442 \n\nState and municipal obligations28 — (2)26 \n\nCorporate obligations40 — — 40 \n\nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity512 — (4)508 \n\nTotal debt securities$50,327 $62 $(2,962)$47,427 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$4,674 $3 $(234)$4,443 \n\nState and municipal obligations7,636 39 (322)7,353 \n\nCorporate obligations23,136 67 (1,186)22,017 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities8,982 22 (708)8,296 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities3,023 3 (240)2,786 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale47,451 134 (2,690)44,895 \n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations506 1 (6)501 \n\nState and municipal obligations28 — (2)26 \n\nCorporate obligations69 — — 69 \n\nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity603 1 (8)596 \n\nTotal debt securities$48,054 $135 $(2,698)$45,491 \n\nNearly all of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities were rated “Double A” or better as of December 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company held $4.9 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of venture investments and employee savings plan related investments. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $3.8 billion and $1.4 billion of equity method investments primarily in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company believes it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectibility of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material.\n\n4.    Fair Value\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. \n\n51\n\n\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:\n\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. \n\nLevel 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:\n\n•Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;\n\n•Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time);\n\n•Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and\n\n•Inputs corroborated by other observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $710 million, $276 million and $211 million respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in the Company’s venture portfolio, based upon transactions of the same or similar security. The assets and liabilities within our South American operations held for sale as of December 31, 2024 were measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is measured based upon unobservable amounts, such as estimated selling price derived from Company-specific information and market conditions. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below:\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.\n\nDebt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service.\n\nFair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. \n\nFair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. \n\nThe fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. \n\nThroughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding.\n\n52\n\n\nLong-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n(in millions)Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets(Level 1)OtherObservableInputs(Level 2)UnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalFair and CarryingValue\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nCash and cash equivalents$25,248 $64 $— $25,312 \n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations4,194 133 — 4,327 \n\nState and municipal obligations— 6,984 — 6,984 \n\nCorporate obligations29 22,841 437 23,307 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 9,584 — 9,584 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 2,717 — 2,717 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale4,223 42,259 437 46,919 \n\nEquity securities1,859 24 65 1,948 \n\nTotal assets at fair value$31,330 $42,347 $502 $74,179 \n\nPercentage of total assets at fair value42 %57 %1 %100 %\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nCash and cash equivalents$25,345 $82 $— $25,427 \n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations4,167 276 — 4,443 \n\nState and municipal obligations— 7,353 — 7,353 \n\nCorporate obligations15 21,800 202 22,017 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 8,296 — 8,296 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 2,786 — 2,786 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale4,182 40,511 202 44,895 \n\nEquity securities2,468 16 69 2,553 \n\nAssets under management1,505 2,140 110 3,755 \n\nTotal assets at fair value$33,500 $42,749 $381 $76,630 \n\nPercentage of total assets at fair value44 %55 %1 %100 %\n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n(in millions)Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets(Level 1)OtherObservableInputs(Level 2)UnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalFairValueTotal Carrying Value\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity$482 $26 $— $508 $512 \n\nLong-term debt and other financing obligations$— $70,565 $— $70,565 $75,604 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity$524 $72 $— $596 $603 \n\nLong-term debt and other financing obligations$— $59,851 $— $59,851 $61,449 \n\nThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses.\n\nThe components of income before income taxes, based upon tax jurisdiction, for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n\n(in millions)202420232022\n\nIncome before income taxes:  \n\nDomestic$28,264 $29,210 $26,685 \n\nForeign(8,193)(98)(342)\n\nTotal income before income taxes$20,071 $29,112 $26,343 \n\nThe components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n\n(in millions)202420232022\n\nCurrent Provision:  \n\nFederal$3,453 $4,418 $4,842 \n\nState and local416 716 855 \n\nForeign1,256 1,079 680 \n\nTotal current provision5,125 6,213 6,377 \n\nDeferred benefit(296)(245)(673)\n\nTotal provision for income taxes$4,829 $5,968 $5,704 \n\n58\n\n\nThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n\n(in millions, except percentages)202420232022\n\nTax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate$4,215 21.0 %$6,114 21.0 %$5,532 21.0 %\n\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit343 1.7 567 2.0 621 2.4 \n\nShare-based awards - excess tax benefit(96)(0.5)(75)(0.3)(110)(0.4)\n\nNon-deductible compensation171 0.9 174 0.6 150 0.6 \n\nForeign rate differential(369)(1.8)(442)(1.5)(265)(1.0)\n\nTax effect of dispositions and other strategic transactions1,215 6.1 (29)(0.1)(215)(0.8)\n\nOther, net(650)(3.3)(341)(1.2)(9)(0.1)\n\nProvision for income taxes$4,829 24.1 %$5,968 20.5 %$5,704 21.7 %\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:\n\n(in millions)20242023\n\nDeferred income tax assets:  \n\nAccrued expenses and allowances$1,055 $754 \n\nU.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards442 417 \n\nShare-based compensation\n\n189 173 \n\nNondeductible liabilities\n\n343 329 \n\nNon-U.S. tax loss carryforwards\n\n21 1,061 \n\nLease liability\n\n846 930 \n\n  Net unrealized losses on investments669 586 \n\nOther-domestic\n\n597 327 \n\nOther-non-U.S.\n\n59 484 \n\nSubtotal4,221 5,061 \n\nLess: valuation allowances(397)(366)\n\nTotal deferred income tax assets3,824 4,695 \n\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\n\nU.S. federal and state intangible assets(4,479)(3,712)\n\nNon-U.S. goodwill and intangible assets(82)(731)\n\nCapitalized software\n\n(288)(415)\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n(400)(371)\n\nPrepaid expenses(374)(326)\n\nOutside basis in partnerships\n\n(960)(811)\n\nLease right-of-use asset\n\n(833)(914)\n\nOther-non-U.S.\n\n(28)(436)\n\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities(7,444)(7,716)\n\nNet deferred income tax liabilities$(3,620)$(3,021)\n\nValuation allowances are provided when it is considered more likely than not deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Substantially all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2025 through 2044, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has historical non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for which a deferred tax asset and valuation allowance of $4.1 billion are not established because realization of the loss carryforwards is remote.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, except for subsidiaries held for sale, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal.\n\n59\n\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: \n\n(in millions)202420232022\n\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period$3,716 $3,081 $2,310 \n\nGross increases:   \n\nCurrent year tax positions\n\n578 782 586 \n\nPrior year tax positions\n\n10 97 206 \n\nGross decreases:   \n\nPrior year tax positions\n\n(121)(212)(21)\n\nStatute of limitations lapses and settlements(60)(32)— \n\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period$4,123 $3,716 $3,081 \n\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $101 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\nThe Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $210 million, $177 million and $64 million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $637 million and $430 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2024, there were $2.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations prior to the 2015 tax year. The Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward.\n\n10.    Shareholders' Equity\n\nRegulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions\n\nThe Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $9.2 billion, including $2.6 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion, including $4.9 billion of extraordinary dividends.\n\nThe Company's financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $37.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nOptum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2024, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.”\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nUnder its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s share repurchase program to authorize the \n\n60\n\n\nrepurchase of up to 35 million shares of its common stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.\n\nA summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n(in millions, except per share data)20242023\n\nCommon share repurchases, shares17 16 \n\nCommon share repurchases, average price per share$529.85 $493.79 \n\nCommon share repurchases, aggregate cost$8,942 $8,000 \n\nBoard authorized shares remaining33 15 \n\nDividends\n\nIn June 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2023. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\n\nThe following table provides details of the Company’s 2024 dividend payments:\n\nPayment DateAmount per ShareTotal Amount Paid\n\n(in millions)\n\nMarch 19$1.88 $1,729 \n\nJune 252.10 1,935 \n\nSeptember 242.10 1,937 \n\nDecember 172.10 1,932 \n\n11.    Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 48 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were 16 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. \n\nStock Options\n\nStock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\n\nSharesWeighted-AverageExercisePriceWeighted-AverageRemainingContractual LifeAggregateIntrinsic Value\n\n (in millions) (in years)(in millions)\n\nOutstanding at beginning of period21 $320 \n\nGranted3 522 \n\nExercised(6)253 \n\nForfeited(1)480 \n\nOutstanding at end of period17 370 5.6$2,338 \n\nExercisable at end of period10 298 4.22,115 \n\nVested and expected to vest, end of period17 368 5.52,335 \n\n61\n\n\nRestricted Shares\n\nRestricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\n\n(shares in millions)SharesWeighted-AverageGrant DateFair Valueper Share\n\nNonvested at beginning of period4 $449 \n\nGranted2 523 \n\nVested(2)435 \n\nNonvested at end of period4 489 \n\nOther Share-Based Compensation Data\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)For the Years Ended December 31,\n\n202420232022\n\nStock Options\n\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share$138 $134 $116 \n\nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised1,886 1,325 1,419 \n\nRestricted Shares\n\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share523 493 483 \n\nTotal fair value of restricted shares vested690 803 760 \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nNumber of shares purchased1 1 1 \n\nShare-Based Compensation Items\n\nShare-based compensation expense, before tax$1,018 $1,059 $925 \n\nShare-based compensation expense, net of tax effects896 937 836 \n\nIncome tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises216 231 207 \n\n(in millions, except years)December 31, 2024\n\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to share awards$1,099 \n\nWeighted-average years to recognize compensation expense1.3\n\nShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates\n\nThe principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows:\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n 202420232022\n\nRisk-free interest rate3.6% - 4.4%\n\n3.8% - 4.6%\n\n1.9% - 4.3%\n\nExpected volatility25.5% - 30.7%\n\n29.7% - 30.6%\n\n30.6% - 30.8%\n\nExpected dividend yield1.4% - 1.5%\n\n1.3% - 1.5%\n\n1.2%\n\nForfeiture rate5.0%5.0%5.0%\n\nExpected life in years4.64.64.7\n\nRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represent the periods of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns.\n\nOther Employee Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments \n\n62\n\n\nwith an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.",

When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health’s fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our data and information systems, including systems powered by or incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences. \n\nThe volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. We depend on the integrity of the data in our information systems to implement new and innovative services, automate and deploy new technologies to simplify administrative processes and clinical decision making, price our products and services adequately, provide effective service to our customers and consumers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, provide timely payments to care providers, and accurately report our results of operations. In addition, increasing connectivity among technologies and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices and new tools and products that leverage AI/ML to improve the customer experience. We anticipate that fast-evolving AI/ML technologies, including generative AI, will play an increasingly important role in our information systems and customer-facing technology products. Our ability to protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with changes in information processing technology (including AI/ML), regulatory standards and changing customer preferences will require an ongoing commitment of significant development and operational resources. If these commitments fail to provide the anticipated benefits, if we are unable to successfully anticipate future technology developments, or if the cost to keep pace with the technological changes exceeds our estimates, we could be exposed to reputational harm and experience adverse effects on our business. \n\nWe may not successfully implement our initiatives to consolidate the number of systems we operate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities, integrate and enhance our systems and develop new systems to keep pace with recent regulations and changes in information processing technology. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs.\n\nSome of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nUncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and  health information technologies, including those powered by or incorporating AI/ML, may alter the competitive landscape or impose new compliance requirements and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in our markets.\n\nIf we or third parties we rely on sustain cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in disruption to our operations or the disclosure of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, negative operational effects, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.\n\nWe routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks  and other security threats and have previously been, and may in the future be, subject to compromises of the information technology systems we use, information we hold, or information held on our behalf by third parties. For example, we previously reported our Change Healthcare business, which we had recently acquired, was subject to a cyberattack in 2024, in which the data involved contained protected health information or personally identifiable information.\n\nWhile we have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber threats to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents, we expect that we will continue to experience these incidents, some of which may negatively affect our business. Further, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, in part due to use of evolving AI/ML technologies (including generative AI), and because our businesses are changing as well, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and threats, timely detect data security \n\n11\n\n\nincidents or implement adequate preventive measures. Threat actors and hackers have previously been, and may in the future be, able to negatively affect our operations by penetrating our security controls and causing system and operational disruptions or shutdowns, accessing, misappropriating or otherwise compromising protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, and developing and deploying viruses, ransomware and other malware that can attack our systems, exploit any security vulnerabilities, and disrupt or shutdown our systems and operations. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise our information security controls. Our systems may also be vulnerable to financial fraud schemes, misplaced or lost data, error, malicious social engineering, or other events which could negatively affect the data or financial accounts, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. There have previously been and may be in the future heightened vulnerabilities due to recently-acquired or non-integrated businesses. We rely in some circumstances on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business. The operations of these vendors are subject to similar risks, but are outside our direct oversight and control.\n\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cybersecurity incident could be material. We have business continuation and resiliency plans which we maintain, update and test regularly in an effort to contain and remediate potential disruptions or cybersecurity events. If our remediation efforts are not successful, we may experience operational interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, compromises of our security measures or the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties, previously and in the future, could expose us or them to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, negative operational impacts, and loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\n\nIf we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other care and service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, some of our activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly and attract negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions which could diminish our bargaining power. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations in an effort to mitigate these impacts. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care providers. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. They may also fail to provide us with the information we need to effectively conduct our businesses, such as information enabling us to estimate costs of care. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. \n\nSome providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these services and may institute litigation or arbitration relying on state and federal laws that define the compensation that must be paid to out-of-network providers in some circumstances.\n\n12\n\n\nThe success of some of our businesses depends on maintaining satisfactory relationships with employed, affiliated, and independently contracted physicians and joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. Our revenues could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or expand satisfactory relationships with physicians, to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following physician departures. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payer competitors.\n\nFurther, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nIf we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur businesses face significant competition in all of the markets in which we operate. In many geographies or product segments, our competitors have and may continue to have certain competitive advantages. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, among both our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among competitors may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, maintain or improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase our profitability. \n\nIn addition, our success in the health care marketplace and future growth depends on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. We may face risks from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in the affected markets. We could sustain competitive disadvantages and loss of market share if we fail to continue developing innovative care models, including by accelerating the transition of care to value-based models that achieve higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expand access to virtual and in-home care. If health care payers or providers are unwilling or unable to enter into value-based agreements with us, we may be unable to successfully establish or maintain the contractual or employment relationships necessary to achieve the quality and cost objectives we have for value-based contracting. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by any failure to develop and apply innovative technologies and other effective data and analytics capabilities or to provide services to our clients focused on these technologies and capabilities.\n\nOur business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if our reputation suffers harm, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.\n\nWe are routinely subject to various private party and governmental legal actions and investigations, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nWe are routinely made party to a variety of private party and governmental legal actions and investigations related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nLegal actions to which we are a party have included and in the future could include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by personnel at our affiliates’ facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the \n\n13\n\n\nenforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), matters related to our use of or alleged failure to adequately safeguard personal information or other proprietary data, claims related to alleged failure of our technology products to operate properly or fairly, contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, some of our pharmacy services operations are subject to clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. \n\nWe are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities.  Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. These actions involve significant defense costs and could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation. \n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved. Even in situations where we engage external insurers, our coverage may be disputed or may not be sufficient to cover the entirety of certain claims. We incur expenses to resolve these matters and current and future legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business, require us to potentially change the way we conduct our business, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses.\n\nOur business could suffer, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, if we fail to successfully manage our strategic alliances, or to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic objectives, including as a result of antitrust regulatory enforcement actions, such as those that have been brought against us in the past, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nSuccessful acquisitions also require us to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present risks different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. For example, we have experienced and in the future may encounter more acute information technology system vulnerabilities or different litigation risk profiles in recently acquired business than we have historically managed. We may be unable to address such vulnerabilities, inadequacies, differences, or failures soon after acquiring a business, which could undermine integration activities, delay launch of acquired products, and increase infrastructure risk. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business have exposed us in the past and may expose us in the future to legal challenges and investigations that could subject us to criminal fines or reputational harm. Even if we are ultimately successful in resolving these matters, defending such claims may be costly and result in negative publicity. If we cannot successfully integrate our acquired businesses and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n14\n\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events, which have had and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. \n\nLarge-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters, public health crises and other extreme events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and impair our ability to provide services to our clients and customers. In addition, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, and our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be affected and sustain a reduced capacity to handle demand for care. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enactment of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting availability of, or our ability to deliver, pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. \n\nOur sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. \n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be impaired by changes in our business practices and the terms of our relationships, including commission levels.\n\nOur businesses are subject to risks associated with unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have a range of impacts on the demand for our products and services. Such conditions also have caused and in future periods could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer particular coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and in the premium and fee revenues we generate. \n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could constrain state and federal budgets and result in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could negatively affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by impacting the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others.\n\nOur failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. \n\nWe depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse talents, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, to operate and expand our business. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. \n\n15\n\n\nOur investment portfolio may sustain losses which could adversely affect our profitability. \n\nMarket fluctuations could impair the value of our investment portfolio and our profitability. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the substantial majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2024. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. \n\nOur investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial or market conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it should become necessary for us to liquidate a material portion of our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. \n\nIf the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $130 billion, representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. \n\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, or other intellectual property, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could suffer. \n\nWe rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, intellectual property rights inherent in software are the subject of substantial litigation, and we expect our software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the health care-focused software industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing and operating costs. \n\nClaims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs.\n\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Business\n\nOur business activities in the United States and other countries are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nWe are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including regulations and licensure requirements related to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPAs. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our \n\n16\n\n\ninsurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations.\n\nSome of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of our contracts with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed to involve an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nSome of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine restrictions; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to achieve targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\n\nThe laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent and often unpredictable change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Additionally, changes in tax laws or unfavorable resolutions of exams could create additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe integration of entities we acquire into our businesses may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could compel us to change how we do business, renegotiate existing contracts and other arrangements, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, resolution of commercial disputes and other actions.\n\nWe also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for some regulated products and services and complete or integrate strategic transactions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on proposed rate increases to HHS on many of our products for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe also currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relationships with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-U.S. regulatory regimes, which vary by jurisdiction, encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers). Any foreign regulator or court may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators or courts. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating outside the United States, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage.\n\nThe health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate concerning industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation, and expose us to unexpected or unwarranted regulatory scrutiny.\n\n17\n\n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our expansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for \n\n18\n\n\npurposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Some of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in future periods could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS.\n\nWe have been and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers regarding, among other allegations, claims that we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Government investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted and in future periods could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nOur pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses.\n\nWe provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and in future periods may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration and Boards of Pharmacy. \n\nWe could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, as well as claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into prohibited transactions.\n\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements of our customer contracts. Additionally, legislative and regulatory action in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, as well as internationally, is emerging in the areas of AI/ML and automation. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. \n\nInternationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security, and AI/ML and automation in the European Union, UK, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers.\n\n19\n\n\nSome of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. \n\nHIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with specified privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. If HHS alleges or finds noncompliance with HIPAA privacy or security requirements, the allegations or findings could damage our reputation and subject us to monetary and other sanctions.\n\nThrough our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to affected customers and the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and could also result in significant fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nAs an enterprise, we increasingly rely on new and evolving technologies, including those powered by or incorporating AI/ML, as part of our internal operations and in the delivery of our products and services.  New technologies have potential and power to improve and optimize operational processes and clinical outcomes across the healthcare system, but also present ethical, technological, legal, regulatory and other risks. With respect to AI/ML, we have developed and implemented policies and procedures intended to promote and sustain responsible design, development, and use of AI/ML, consistent with industry best practices. Any inadequacy or failure in compliance with our responsible use of AI/ML policies and procedures or emerging laws, regulations and standards governing AI/ML use could cause our technology products not to operate as intended or to produce outcomes, including possible regulatory enforcement action or litigation that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. \n\nBecause we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \n\nNone. \n\n20\n\n\nITEM 1C.    CYBERSECURITY\n\nUnitedHealth Group manages cybersecurity and data protection through a continuously evolving framework. The framework allows us to identify, assess and mitigate the risks we face, and assists us in establishing policies and safeguards to protect our systems and the information of those we serve. \n\nOur cybersecurity program is managed by our Chief Digital and Technology Officer and our Chief Security Officer. The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of our cybersecurity program and is responsible for reviewing and assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity and data protection policies, procedures and resource commitment, including key risk areas and mitigation strategies. As part of this process, the Audit and Finance Committee receives regular updates from the Chief Digital and Technology Officer and the Chief Security Officer on critical issues related to our information security risks, cybersecurity strategy, supplier risk and business continuity capabilities. The Audit and Finance Committee has also added a leading cybersecurity incident and response firm to serve as its advisor on cybersecurity matters.\n\nThe Company’s framework includes an incident management and response program that continuously monitors the Company’s information systems for vulnerabilities, threats and incidents; manages and takes action to contain incidents that occur; remediates vulnerabilities; and communicates the details of significant threats and incidents to management, including the Chief Digital and Technology Officer and the Chief Security Officer, as deemed necessary or appropriate. Pursuant to the Company’s incident response plan, incidents are reported to the Audit and Finance Committee and appropriate government agencies and other authorities, as deemed necessary or appropriate, considering the actual or potential impact, significance and scope. \n\nWe require our third-party partners and contractors to handle data in accordance with our data privacy and information security requirements and applicable laws. We regularly engage with our suppliers, partners, contractors, service providers and internal development teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner and monitor system upgrades to mitigate future risk, and evaluate whether they employ appropriate and effective controls and continuity plans for their systems and operations. \n\nTo ensure that our program is designed and operating effectively, our infrastructure and information systems are audited periodically by internal and external auditors. We have obtained various certifications from industry-recognized certifying organizations as a result of certain external audits. We also perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to improve system security and address emerging security threats. Our internal audit team independently assesses security controls against our enterprise policies to evaluate compliance and leverages a combination of auditing and security frameworks to evaluate how leading practices are applied throughout our enterprise. Audit results and remediation progress are reported to and monitored by senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee. We also periodically partner with industry-leading cybersecurity firms to assess our cybersecurity program. These assessments complement our other assessment work by evaluating our cybersecurity program as a whole.\n\nWe complete an enterprise information risk assessment as part of our overall enterprise information security risk management assessment, which is overseen by our Chief Security Officer. This risk assessment is a review of internal and external threats that evaluates changes to the information risk landscape to inform the investments and program enhancements to be made in the future to rapidly respond and recover from potential attacks, including rebuild and recovery protocols for key systems. We evaluate our enterprise information security risk to address unexpected or unforeseen changes in the risk environment or our systems and the resulting impacts are communicated to the Company’s overall enterprise risk management program.\n\nWe believe our Chief Digital and Technology Officer and our Chief Security Officer have the appropriate knowledge and expertise to effectively manage our cybersecurity program. The Chief Digital and Technology Officer has experience leading enterprise digital transformation efforts for a large multinational corporation and held several leadership and growth positions at a global technology consulting and services firm before joining UnitedHealth Group. Our Chief Security Officer has more than 30 years of experience as a security professional in both the private and public sectors, including in law enforcement. Prior to joining UnitedHealth Group, he served in security leadership roles at several large multinational corporations and has additionally served on cybersecurity advisory boards for some of the largest corporations in the country.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, but there can be no assurance that any such risk will not materially affect the Company in the future. For further information about the cybersecurity risks we face, and potential impacts, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\n21\n\n\nITEM 2.    PROPERTIES \n\nWe own and lease real properties to support our business operations in the United States and other countries.

Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n•Optum Health;\n\n•Optum Insight;\n\n•Optum Rx; and\n\n•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nChange Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers. \n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser extent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals’ information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n24\n\n\nBusiness Trends\n\nOur businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\n\nPricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\n\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\n\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends.” Our 2025 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\n\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\n\nMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As expected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, which may continue in future periods. We also observed an upshift in hospital coding intensity and an acceleration in the prescribing of certain high-cost medications in early response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We expect these additional factors to continue into future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\n\nAs a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were approximately $640 million.\n\nMedicaid Redeterminations. Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remained well short of current care activity. We expect this gap between people’s health status and rates will narrow in 2025.\n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration. \n\nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the experience and health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.\n\n25\n\n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\nFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\nMedicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend. The Advance Notice for 2026 rates proposes an industry base rate increase also well short of forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\n\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\n\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023 and other financial results.\n\n•Consolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%. \n\n•UnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in commercial offerings, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations.\n\n•Earnings from operations of $32.3 billion compared to $32.4 billion last year.\n\n•Diluted earnings per common share was $15.51, impacted by the loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale.\n\n•Cash flows from operations were $24.2 billion.\n\n26\n\n\nRESULTS SUMMARY\n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:\n\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nRevenues:\n\nPremiums$308,810 $290,827 $257,157 $17,983 6 %\n\nProducts50,226 42,583 37,424 7,643 18 \n\nServices36,040 34,123 27,551 1,917 6 \n\nInvestment and other income5,202 4,089 2,030 1,113 27 \n\nTotal revenues400,278 371,622 324,162 28,656 8 \n\nOperating costs:\n\nMedical costs264,185 241,894 210,842 22,291 9 \n\nOperating costs53,013 54,628 47,782 (1,615)(3)\n\nCost of products sold46,694 38,770 33,703 7,924 20 \n\nDepreciation and amortization4,099 3,972 3,400 127 3 \n\nTotal operating costs367,991 339,264 295,727 28,727 8 \n\nEarnings from operations32,287 32,358 28,435 (71)— \n\nInterest expense(3,906)(3,246)(2,092)(660)20 \n\nLoss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale(8,310)— — (8,310)nm\n\nEarnings before income taxes20,071 29,112 26,343 (9,041)(31)\n\nProvision for income taxes(4,829)(5,968)(5,704)1,139 (19)\n\nNet earnings15,242 23,144 20,639 (7,902)(34)\n\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(837)(763)(519)(74)10 \n\nNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$14,405 $22,381 $20,120 $(7,976)(36)%\n\nDiluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$15.51 $23.86 $21.18 $(8.35)(35)%\n\nMedical care ratio (a)85.5 %83.2 %82.0 %2.3 %\n\nOperating cost ratio13.2 14.7 14.7 (1.5)\n\nOperating margin8.1 8.7 8.8 (0.6)\n\nTax rate24.1 20.5 21.7 3.6 \n\nNet earnings margin (b)3.6 6.0 6.2 (2.4)\n\nReturn on equity (c)15.9 %27.0 %27.2 %(11.1)%\n\n________ \n\nnm = not meaningful\n\n(a)Medical care ratio (MCR) is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.\n\n(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders.\n\n(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people’s health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\n\n27\n\n\nOperating Cost Ratio\n\nThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to operating cost management and gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, partially offset by the impact of our direct response efforts to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and investments to support future growth.\n\nLoss on Sale of Subsidiary and Subsidiaries Held for Sale\n\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Brazil operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $7.1 billion, of which $4.1 billion related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a plan to sell its remaining South American operations, which were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of $1.2 billion, of which $855 million related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses. \n\nReportable Segments\n\nSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information:\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nRevenues\n\nUnitedHealthcare$298,208 $281,360 $249,741 $16,848 6 %\n\nOptum Health105,358 95,319 71,174 10,039 11 \n\nOptum Insight18,757 18,932 14,581 (175)(1)\n\nOptum Rx133,231 116,087 99,773 17,144 15 \n\nOptum eliminations(4,389)(3,703)(2,760)(686)19 \n\nOptum\n\n252,957 226,635 182,768 26,322 12 \n\nEliminations(150,887)(136,373)(108,347)(14,514)11 \n\nConsolidated revenues$400,278 $371,622 $324,162 $28,656 8 %\n\nEarnings from operations\n\nUnitedHealthcare$15,584 $16,415 $14,379 $(831)(5)%\n\nOptum Health7,770 6,560 6,032 1,210 18 \n\nOptum Insight3,097 4,268 3,588 (1,171)(27)\n\nOptum Rx5,836 5,115 4,436 721 14 \n\nOptum\n\n16,703 15,943 14,056 760 5 \n\nConsolidated earnings from operations\n\n$32,287 $32,358 $28,435 $(71)— %\n\nOperating margin\n\nUnitedHealthcare5.2 %5.8 %5.8 %(0.6)%\n\nOptum Health7.4 6.9 8.5 0.5 \n\nOptum Insight16.5 22.5 24.6 (6.0)\n\nOptum Rx4.4 4.4 4.4 — \n\nOptum\n\n6.6 7.0 7.7 (0.4)\n\nConsolidated operating margin8.1 %8.7 %8.8 %(0.6)%\n\n28\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare\n\nThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business:\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic$74,489 $67,187 $63,599 $7,302 11 %\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global3,667 9,307 8,668 (5,640)(61)\n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total78,156 76,494 72,267 1,662 2 \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\n\n139,482 129,862 113,671 9,620 7 \n\nUnitedHealthcare Community & State\n\n80,570 75,004 63,803 5,566 7 \n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare revenues$298,208 $281,360 $249,741 $16,848 6 %\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement:\n\n December 31,Change\n\n(in thousands, except percentages)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nCommercial - domestic:\n\nRisk-based8,845 8,115 8,045 730 9 %\n\nFee-based20,885 19,200 18,640 1,685 9 \n\nTotal commercial - domestic29,730 27,315 26,685 2,415 9 \n\nMedicare Advantage7,845 7,695 7,105 150 2 \n\nMedicaid7,435 7,845 8,170 (410)(5)\n\nMedicare Supplement (Standardized)4,335 4,355 4,375 (20)— \n\nTotal community and senior19,615 19,895 19,650 (280)(1)\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical49,345 47,210 46,335 2,135 5 \n\nCommercial - global1,330 5,540 5,360 (4,210)(76)\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare - medical50,675 52,750 51,695 (2,075)(4)%\n\nSupplemental Data:\n\nMedicare Part D stand-alone3,050 3,315 3,295 (265)(8)%\n\nUnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings, partially offset by decreased people served globally due to the sale of the Brazil operations and in Medicaid offerings due to redeterminations. Earnings from operations decreased due to Medicare Advantage funding reductions, the impacts of Medicaid redeterminations, member mix and incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, and the growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and domestic commercial offerings.\n\nOptum\n\nTotal revenues increased due to growth at Optum Rx and Optum Health. Earnings from operations increased with growth at Optum Health and Optum Rx, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at Optum Insight. The results by segment were as follows:\n\nOptum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements. Earnings from operations increased due to gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, increased investment income and cost management initiatives, partially offset by Medicare Advantage funding reductions, costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements and medical care activity. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2024 compared to 103 million people as of December 31, 2023. \n\n29\n\n\nOptum Insight\n\nRevenues at Optum Insight decreased primarily due the business disruption impacts from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by growth in technology services. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to direct response costs and business disruption impacts related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions.\n\nOptum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients and growth in pharmacy services. Earnings from operations also increased due to operating cost efficiencies and supply chain initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,623 million and 1,542 million adjusted scripts in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nLiquidity\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally derived from earnings before noncash expenses. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n\n30\n\n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n For the Years Ended December 31,Change\n\n(in millions)2024202320222024 vs. 2023\n\nSources of cash:\n\nCash provided by operating activities$24,204 $29,068 $26,206 $(4,864)\n\nIssuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments14,660 4,280 12,536 10,380 \n\nProceeds from common share issuances\n\n1,846 1,353 1,253 493 \n\nCustomer funds administered\n\n— — 5,548 — \n\nCash received for dispositions2,041 685 3,414 1,356 \n\nSales and maturities of investments, net of purchases525 — — 525 \n\nTotal sources of cash43,276 35,386 48,957 7,890 \n\nUses of cash:\n\nCash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, net of cash assumed(13,408)(10,136)(21,458)(3,272)\n\nCommon share repurchases(9,000)(8,000)(7,000)(1,000)\n\nCash dividends paid(7,533)(6,761)(5,991)(772)\n\nPurchases of property, equipment and capitalized software\n\n(3,499)(3,386)(2,802)(113)\n\nPurchases of investments, net of sales and maturities — (1,777)(6,837)1,777 \n\nPurchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests(280)(730)(176)450 \n\nLoans to care providers - cyberattack, net of repayments(4,519)— — (4,519)\n\nCustomer funds administered(1,560)(521)— (1,039)\n\nOther(3,312)(2,110)(2,737)(1,202)\n\nTotal uses of cash(43,111)(33,421)(47,001)(9,690)\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n\n(61)97 34 (158)\n\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents, including cash within businesses held for sale $104 $2,062 $1,990 $(1,958)\n\nLess: cash within businesses held for sale(219)— — (219)\n\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(115)$2,062 $1,990 $(2,177)\n\n2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023 Cash Flows\n\nDecreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by CMS Medicare funding reductions, Change Healthcare cyberattack response actions, increased medical costs and changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net sales and maturities of investments and cash received from dispositions, offset by loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, increased cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, decreased customer funds administered and increased share repurchases.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $77.1 billion included $25.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $800 million was available for general corporate use), $46.9 billion of debt securities and $4.9 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2024. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n31\n\n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. \n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n•Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n\n•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n\n•Purchase and other obligations. These include $11.5 billion, $2.4 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds, strategic transactions and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024.\n\n•Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n\n•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail. We do not have any material potential required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenants under our bank credit facilities.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nCredit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n\nMoody’sS&P GlobalFitchA.M. Best\n\n RatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlookRatingsOutlook\n\nSenior unsecured debtA2StableA+StableAStableAStable\n\nCommercial paperP-1n/aA-1n/aF1n/aAMB-1+n/a\n\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.\n\n32\n\n\nShare Repurchase Program. In June 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of Common Stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. As of December 31, 2024, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 33 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nDividends. In June 2024, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nPending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.\n\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs Payable\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.\n\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $700 million, $840 million and $410 million, respectively.\n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\n\nCompletion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.\n\n33\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2024: \n\nCompletion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\n\n(in millions)\n\n(0.75)%$973 \n\n(0.50)647 \n\n(0.25)322 \n\n0.25(321)\n\n0.50(640)\n\n0.75(958)\n\nMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2024: \n\nMedical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\n\n(in millions)\n\n3%$1,264 \n\n2843 \n\n1421 \n\n(1)(421)\n\n(2)(843)\n\n(3)(1,264)\n\nThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nManagement believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2024 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, 2024 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $260 million. \n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n\nGoodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\n34\n\n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.\n\nFinancial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2024, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\n\n35\n\n\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $33 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2024, $27 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, $46 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $49 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.\n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\n\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities \n\n2 %$666 $537 $(4,151)$(8,866)\n\n1333 268 (2,182)(4,828)\n\n(1)(333)(252)2,082 5,831 \n\n(2)(666)(503)4,311 12,935 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities \n\n2%$688 $393 $(3,642)$(8,142)\n\n1344 196 (1,871)(4,444)\n\n(1)(344)(180)1,954 5,391 \n\n(2)(688)(360)3,964 11,992 \n\nNote: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.9 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of venture investments and employee savings plan related investments.\n\n36\n\n\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nPage\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No 34)\n\n38\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n40\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n41\n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n\n42\n\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\n\n43\n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n44\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n45\n\n1.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nMedical Care Services Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR) using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles.\n\nWe identified medical care services IBNR as a critical audit matter because it requires significant management assumptions in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methods, assumptions, and judgments in developing estimates for medical care services IBNR.\n\n38\n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to medical care services IBNR included the following, among others:\n\n•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the IBNR for these services, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.\n\n•We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.\n\n•With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate IBNR for these services by:\n\n–Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management’s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods.\n\n–Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR for these services and comparing our estimate to management’s estimate.\n\n–Performing a retrospective review comparing management’s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2024 with dates of service in 2023 or prior.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nWe have

Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and “the Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n2.Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\nRevenues \n\nPremiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers’ health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.\n\n45\n\n\nProducts and Services\n\nFor the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\nMedical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and \n\n46\n\n\ndemographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\nCost of Products Sold \n\nThe Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments \n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. \n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. \n\nAssets Under Management \n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\nOther Current Receivables \n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. \n\n47\n\n\nThe Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $12.5 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.\n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets included pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $3.8 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software \n\nProperty, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. \n\nThe Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: \n\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment3 to 10 years\n\nBuildings35 to 40 years\n\nCapitalized software3 to 5 years\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nThe Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. \n\nThe Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nGoodwill \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital levels and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\nThere was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nOther Current Liabilities \n\nOther current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($13.7 billion and $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances.\n\n48\n\n\nPolicy Acquisition Costs\n\nThe Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred.\n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company’s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests’ activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n(in millions)20242023\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period$4,498 $4,897 \n\nNet earnings174 188 \n\nAcquisitions33 122 \n\nRedemptions(280)(730)\n\nDistributions (125)(144)\n\nFair value and other adjustments23 165 \n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period$4,323 $4,498 \n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee’s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nNet Earnings Per Common Share \n\nThe Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares. \n\n49\n\n\n3.    Investments\n\nA summary of debt securities by major security type is as follows:\n\n(in millions)AmortizedCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValue\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$4,600 $1 $(274)$4,327 \n\nState and municipal obligations7,357 2 (375)6,984 \n\nCorporate obligations24,391 56 (1,140)23,307 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities10,577 1 (994)9,584 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities2,890 2 (175)2,717 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale49,815 62 (2,958)46,919 \n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations444 — (2)442 \n\nState and municipal obligations28 — (2)26 \n\nCorporate obligations40 — — 40 \n\nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity512 — (4)508 \n\nTotal debt securities$50,327 $62 $(2,962)$47,427 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$4,674 $3 $(234)$4,443 \n\nState and municipal obligations7,636 39 (322)7,353 \n\nCorporate obligations23,136 67 (1,186)22,017 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities8,982 22 (708)8,296 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities3,023 3 (240)2,786 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale47,451 134 (2,690)44,895 \n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations506 1 (6)501 \n\nState and municipal obligations28 — (2)26 \n\nCorporate obligations69 — — 69 \n\nTotal debt securities - held-to-maturity603 1 (8)596 \n\nTotal debt securities$48,054 $135 $(2,698)$45,491 \n\nNearly all of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities were rated “Double A” or better as of December 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company held $4.9 billion of equity securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily consist of venture investments and employee savings plan related investments. Additionally, the Company’s investments included $3.8 billion and $1.4 billion of equity method investments primarily in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material. \n\n50\n\n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of December 31, 2024, by contractual maturity, were as follows:\n\nAvailable-for-SaleHeld-to-Maturity\n\n(in millions)AmortizedCostFairValueAmortizedCostFairValue\n\nDue in one year or less$3,952 $3,932 $320 $319 \n\nDue after one year through five years14,845 14,384 161 161 \n\nDue after five years through ten years12,110 11,213 14 13 \n\nDue after ten years5,441 5,089 17 15 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities10,577 9,584 — — \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities2,890 2,717 — — \n\nTotal debt securities$49,815 $46,919 $512 $508 \n\nThe fair value of available-for-sale debt securities with gross unrealized losses by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows:\n\n Less Than 12 Months12 Months or Greater Total\n\n(in millions)FairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueGrossUnrealizedLosses\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$1,475 $(51)$2,152 $(223)$3,627 $(274)\n\nState and municipal obligations2,593 (58)4,085 (317)6,678 (375)\n\nCorporate obligations7,402 (213)11,449 (927)18,851 (1,140)\n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n\n4,791 (191)4,674 (803)9,465 (994)\n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n\n416 (5)1,863 (170)2,279 (175)\n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale$16,677 $(518)$24,223 $(2,440)$40,900 $(2,958)\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations$1,270 $(7)$2,077 $(227)$3,347 $(234)\n\nState and municipal obligations907 (7)4,063 (315)4,970 (322)\n\nCorporate obligations1,826 (17)14,696 (1,169)16,522 (1,186)\n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n\n1,337 (12)5,069 (696)6,406 (708)\n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities\n\n279 (6)2,202 (234)2,481 (240)\n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale$5,619 $(49)$28,107 $(2,641)$33,726 $(2,690)\n\nThe Company’s unrealized losses from all securities as of December 31, 2024 were generated from approximately 34,000 positions out of a total of 43,000 positions. The Company believes it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectibility of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material.\n\n4.    Fair Value\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. \n\n51\n\n\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:\n\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. \n\nLevel 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:\n\n•Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;\n\n•Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time);\n\n•Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and\n\n•Inputs corroborated by other observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $710 million, $276 million and $211 million respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in the Company’s venture portfolio, based upon transactions of the same or similar security. The assets and liabilities within our South American operations held for sale as of December 31, 2024 were measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is measured based upon unobservable amounts, such as estimated selling price derived from Company-specific information and market conditions. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below:\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.\n\nDebt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service.\n\nFair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. \n\nFair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. \n\nThe fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. \n\nThroughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding.\n\n52\n\n\nLong-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company’s investments in debt securities.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n(in millions)Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets(Level 1)OtherObservableInputs(Level 2)UnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalFair and CarryingValue\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nCash and cash equivalents$25,248 $64 $— $25,312 \n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations4,194 133 — 4,327 \n\nState and municipal obligations— 6,984 — 6,984 \n\nCorporate obligations29 22,841 437 23,307 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 9,584 — 9,584 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 2,717 — 2,717 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale4,223 42,259 437 46,919 \n\nEquity securities1,859 24 65 1,948 \n\nTotal assets at fair value$31,330 $42,347 $502 $74,179 \n\nPercentage of total assets at fair value42 %57 %1 %100 %\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nCash and cash equivalents$25,345 $82 $— $25,427 \n\nDebt securities - available-for-sale:\n\nU.S. government and agency obligations4,167 276 — 4,443 \n\nState and municipal obligations— 7,353 — 7,353 \n\nCorporate obligations15 21,800 202 22,017 \n\nU.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 8,296 — 8,296 \n\nNon-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities— 2,786 — 2,786 \n\nTotal debt securities - available-for-sale4,182 40,511 202 44,895 \n\nEquity securities2,468 16 69 2,553 \n\nAssets under management1,505 2,140 110 3,755 \n\nTotal assets at fair value$33,500 $42,749 $381 $76,630 \n\nPercentage of total assets at fair value44 %55 %1 %100 %\n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n(in millions)Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets(Level 1)OtherObservableInputs(Level 2)UnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalFairValueTotal Carrying Value\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity$482 $26 $— $508 $512 \n\nLong-term debt and other financing obligations$— $70,565 $— $70,565 $75,604 \n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDebt securities - held-to-maturity$524 $72 $— $596 $603 \n\nLong-term debt and other financing obligations$— $59,851 $— $59,851 $61,449 \n\nThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Substantially all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2025 through 2044, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has historical non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for which a deferred tax asset and valuation allowance of $4.1 billion are not established because realization of the loss carryforwards is remote.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, except for subsidiaries held for sale, the Company’s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal.\n\n59\n\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: \n\n(in millions)202420232022\n\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period$3,716 $3,081 $2,310 \n\nGross increases:   \n\nCurrent year tax positions\n\n578 782 586 \n\nPrior year tax positions\n\n10 97 206 \n\nGross decreases:   \n\nPrior year tax positions\n\n(121)(212)(21)\n\nStatute of limitations lapses and settlements(60)(32)— \n\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period$4,123 $3,716 $3,081 \n\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $101 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\nThe Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $210 million, $177 million and $64 million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $637 million and $430 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2024, there were $2.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company’s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations prior to the 2015 tax year. The Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward.\n\n10.    Shareholders' Equity\n\nRegulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions\n\nThe Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $9.2 billion, including $2.6 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion, including $4.9 billion of extraordinary dividends.\n\nThe Company's financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $37.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nOptum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2024, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.”\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nUnder its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s share repurchase program to authorize the \n\n60\n\n\nrepurchase of up to 35 million shares of its common stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.\n\nA summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n(in millions, except per share data)20242023\n\nCommon share repurchases, shares17 16 \n\nCommon share repurchases, average price per share$529.85 $493.79 \n\nCommon share repurchases, aggregate cost$8,942 $8,000 \n\nBoard authorized shares remaining33 15 \n\nDividends\n\nIn June 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.40 compared to $7.52 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2023. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\n\nThe following table provides details of the Company’s 2024 dividend payments:\n\nPayment DateAmount per ShareTotal Amount Paid\n\n(in millions)\n\nMarch 19$1.88 $1,729 \n\nJune 252.10 1,935 \n\nSeptember 242.10 1,937 \n\nDecember 172.10 1,932 \n\n11.    Share-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company’s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 48 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were 16 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. \n\nStock Options\n\nStock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\n\nSharesWeighted-AverageExercisePriceWeighted-AverageRemainingContractual LifeAggregateIntrinsic Value\n\n (in millions) (in years)(in millions)\n\nOutstanding at beginning of period21 $320 \n\nGranted3 522 \n\nExercised(6)253 \n\nForfeited(1)480 \n\nOutstanding at end of period17 370 5.6$2,338 \n\nExercisable at end of period10 298 4.22,115 \n\nVested and expected to vest, end of period17 368 5.52,335 \n\n61\n\n\nRestricted Shares\n\nRestricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is summarized in the table below:\n\n(shares in millions)SharesWeighted-AverageGrant DateFair Valueper Share\n\nNonvested at beginning of period4 $449 \n\nGranted2 523 \n\nVested(2)435 \n\nNonvested at end of period4 489 \n\nOther Share-Based Compensation Data\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)For the Years Ended December 31,\n\n202420232022\n\nStock Options\n\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share$138 $134 $116 \n\nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised1,886 1,325 1,419 \n\nRestricted Shares\n\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share523 493 483 \n\nTotal fair value of restricted shares vested690 803 760 \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nNumber of shares purchased1 1 1 \n\nShare-Based Compensation Items\n\nShare-based compensation expense, before tax$1,018 $1,059 $925 \n\nShare-based compensation expense, net of tax effects896 937 836 \n\nIncome tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises216 231 207 \n\n(in millions, except years)December 31, 2024\n\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to share awards$1,099 \n\nWeighted-average years to recognize compensation expense1.3\n\nShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates\n\nThe principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows:\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n 202420232022\n\nRisk-free interest rate3.6% - 4.4%\n\n3.8% - 4.6%\n\n1.9% - 4.3%\n\nExpected volatility25.5% - 30.7%\n\n29.7% - 30.6%\n\n30.6% - 30.8%\n\nExpected dividend yield1.4% - 1.5%\n\n1.3% - 1.5%\n\n1.2%\n\nForfeiture rate5.0%5.0%5.0%\n\nExpected life in years4.64.64.7\n\nRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company’s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represent the periods of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns.\n\nOther Employee Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments \n\n62\n\n\nwith an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.",
