      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\n  Corporate Information\n\n  Our principal executive offices are located at 3025 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, California. Our telephone number is 408-473-2500. We maintain a corporate website at www.adeia.com. The reference to our website does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on this website. Adeia and the Adeia logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Adeia Inc. or its affiliated companies in the U.S. All other company, brand and product names may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective companies.\n\n  Overview\n\n  We (the “Company,” “Adeia,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) are a technology company and an innovation incubator. We have spent decades investing in advanced research and development to create market-leading technologies for the entertainment, media, consumer electronics, and semiconductor industries. Our innovative solutions support practically every aspect of consumers’ day-to-day interaction with media, consumer electronics and entertainment, enabling our customers to build customized, next-generation solutions for users around the globe. Our commitment to and investment in innovation has resulted in a leading intellectual property (“IP”) licensing platform in these industries, with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor IP. In order to serve an increasingly connected world, we invent, develop, acquire and license fundamental innovations that enhance billions of devices and shape the way millions of people explore and experience entertainment and technology across a variety of platforms.\n\n  Ideas are at the heart of our business and are embedded in our name, which means “to license” in Greek. Licensing these ideas is how we go to market – by making our ideas broadly available to the media and semiconductor industries. Our innovations address one of the biggest consumer trends in entertainment today – the massive proliferation of entertainment content and the rapidly changing habits of how consumers are finding, engaging with and enjoying entertainment and evolving technology, such as AI.\n\n  Our IP licensing platform provides access to innovations that allow our customers, who are some of the largest media, entertainment, consumer electronics, social media and semiconductor companies in the world, to create cutting-edge technology solutions and products. Our engineers and scientists are focused on innovating and creating the most advanced and forward-thinking solutions to help solve challenges facing the media and semiconductor industries. Our internal innovation engine accounts for approximately 85% of our combined patent portfolio and generates ideas that are converted into our powerful IP, which enables fundamental technologies in our target markets.\n\n  We have a long history of innovation across a diverse set of applications and technologies and have grown an IP portfolio of approximately 12,250 media and semiconductor patent assets, which are specifically designed to meet the evolving needs of businesses and consumers. Our media portfolio covers fundamental aspects of the entertainment experience across platforms, including how users search, save, stream, discover, consume, personalize and interact with content. Many of our media solutions have become ubiquitous across the industry and are being incorporated into emerging solutions that span new and adjacent markets. Our semiconductor portfolio is comprised of patents and technology know-how that enable the new era in semiconductors, including the next generation of logic and memory semiconductors that are powering the increasing demand for generative artificial intelligence applications. Our semiconductor portfolio generally covers three fundamental technology areas, hybrid bonding (or Direct Bond Interconnect (DBI)), advanced processing nodes, and advanced packaging solutions. Specifically, our portfolio enables us to address the semiconductor market demands of higher bandwidth, improved compute performance and cost management in heterogeneous integration. \n\n  Business Separation\n\n  In February 2022, Xperi Holding Corporation (“Xperi Hold Co”) introduced “Adeia” as the new brand for its IP licensing business. On October 1, 2022, Xperi Hold Co’s product business was separated from Xperi Hold Co through a tax-efficient spin-off transaction (the “Separation”) and became an independent, publicly-traded company named Xperi Inc. The IP licensing business was retained by Xperi Hold Co, which was renamed Adeia Inc.\n\n  4\n\n  Following the Separation, Xperi Inc. became an independent, publicly-traded company, and we retain no ownership interest in Xperi Inc. Xperi Inc.’s historical financial results for periods prior to the Separation are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for the periods presented. For further details, refer to “Note 9 – Discontinued Operations”, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n  Our Strategy \n\n  We have adopted a proactive strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and IP. We continue to grow our patent portfolios in size and relevance through ongoing investment in internal innovation, strategic management and targeted acquisitions within our expanding addressable markets. \n\n  We conduct our business primarily by licensing our innovations to leading companies in the broader media and semiconductor industries and companies adopting new technologies that will help drive these industries forward. License arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational IP portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how.\n\n  Media Strategy\n\n  We invent, develop, and license fundamental innovations that shape the way millions of people explore and experience entertainment and enhance media services that span billions of devices in an increasingly connected world. From TVs to smartphones, in almost any place you can think of, from home to work to on the go, and in all types of entertainment experiences, from Pay-TV to over-the-top (“OTT”) to social media and to the metaverse, managing content and connections in a way that is smart, immersive, and personal is precisely what our innovations do.\n\n  Our patented innovations broadly cover all aspects of the entertainment experience, including (i) guidance, (ii) discovery, (iii) search, (iv) recommendations, (v) multi-screen, (vi) personalization, (vii) data analytics, (viii) advertising, (ix) computer vision, (x) content storage and (xi) high-performance computing.\n\n  5\n\n  We license our patented media innovations for use with traditional linear television, both in North America and internationally, as well as in connection with OTT and social media services that provide access to entertainment inside and outside the home on a broad array of devices. We believe the continued growth of video consumption, the evolution of how consumers explore and experience video, and the need for content storage and high-performance computing present new opportunities for us to continue to develop patentable innovations, expand the industries we serve and license additional patent rights.\n\n  Semiconductor Strategy\n\n  Our semiconductor business invents, develops, and licenses the fundamental technologies that enable the current and next generation devices that we use to watch and enjoy entertainment. We are focused on two emerging technologies, hybrid bonding and advanced processing nodes, both of which address semiconductor market demands for higher bandwidth, improved compute performance and cost management with 2.5 and 3D heterogeneous integration. We license our patented innovations to leading semiconductor companies, and partner with the industry to accelerate the adoption of these technologies. We believe that the multi-generational nature of our DBI platforms will be beneficial to the greater semiconductor sector for years to come.\n\n  Recently, we have also launched a co-optimization effort that builds on our core fundamental semiconductor IP. Co-optimization is a holistic approach whereby the circuit design, process design and system design are optimized simultaneously. We believe that co-optimization is necessary given the limitations of Moore’s Law and that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this need given our existing portfolio of semiconductor technologies.  \n\n  IP Portfolio Licensing Markets\n\n  Our business has a strong foundation of recurring, annual revenue. That revenue is derived from licensing our patent portfolios across multiple markets, including:\n\n  •Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (“MVPD”): includes cable, satellite and telecommunications television providers that aggregate and distribute linear content over their own networks (MVPDs), as well as television providers that aggregate and stream linear content over broadband networks (virtual MVPDs). Customers typically pay us a monthly per-subscriber fee and include many of the leading MVPDs and virtual MVPDs such as Altice USA (including Optimum), AT&T (including DirecTV and DirecTV Stream), Charter, Comcast (including Sky), Cox, DISH Network (including Sling TV), Google (including YouTube TV), Verizon and Vodafone.\n\n  •OTT Video Service Providers: includes subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) and free advertising-supported streaming service (FAST) providers that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows, music and other types of media content, as well as content providers, networks and media companies that provide content directly to consumers through a variety of business models. Customers have typically paid us fixed fees for specified periods of time and include some of the leading media companies and services including Amazon (including Amazon Prime), DAZN, Google (including YouTube), Starz and Peacock.\n\n  •Consumer Electronics (“CE”) Manufacturers: includes producers of content access points such as smart televisions, streaming media devices, video game consoles, mobile devices, content storage devices and other connected media devices. Our CE licenses are typically structured as license fees based on the number of units licensed, for specified products, in defined territories. Our agreements with some of the larger CE manufacturers generally allow customers to ship an unlimited number of units, provided they pay us fixed fees for specified periods of time. Select customers include LG, Panasonic, Roku, Samsung, Sharp, TCL, and Vizio. \n\n  6\n\n  •Social Media Companies: includes social media companies that allow users to stream and upload user-generated content, often leveraging a variety of computer vision technologies. Customers have typically paid us fixed fees for specified periods of time and include several of the leading social media companies. \n\n  •Semiconductors: includes providers of memory, logic, sensors, and radio frequency (“RF”) devices commonly used in electronic products such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, game consoles and servers. Our agreements with our semiconductor customers can include fixed fees, per-unit fees, milestone based fees, or a combination of these fees. These agreements are typically for specified periods of time, and our customers include Kioxia, Micron, OmniVision, Samsung, SK hynix, Sony, UMC and Western Digital.\n\n  We continue to grow our business with several specific opportunities, including:\n\n  •Greater penetration in OTT: The OTT market is currently experiencing explosive growth. For example, the leading provider of SVOD now has worldwide subscribers in excess of 200 million. While these services have significantly lower ARPUs as compared to traditional Pay-TV, the scale of the overall OTT video market continues to grow and presents an increasingly important licensing opportunity for our business. In December of 2024 we announced that Amazon signed a multi-year license agreement for access to our media portfolio. Amazon is a top five provider of OTT services and we believe represents a significant proof point that our fundamental innovations from our patent portfolios are similarly relevant to these new and widely-adopted OTT video services.\n\n  •Accelerate the Semiconductor licensing business: With the rising cost and complexity of developing cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, the industry is increasingly looking beyond Moore’s Law towards advanced packaging and 3D integration technologies. Leveraging the combination of our highly-experienced technologists, scientists and engineers and our advanced research and development (“R&D”) labs, we continue to develop industry-leading 3D integration solutions such as hybrid bonding that meet the demand for greater functionality, higher performance and smaller size for the next generation of electronics.\n\n  •Expand into new and adjacent markets: With the proliferation of media discovery and distribution and computer vision technologies into new and adjacent markets outside of our current MVPD, OTT, and social media markets, new opportunities have emerged for us to leverage our existing IP portfolios to seek license arrangements with many new companies. Some of these new markets include companies that provide advertising technology, automotive, e-commerce, gaming, and music streaming products and services. We have begun to see traction in these adjacent markets and announced a new e-commerce deal with a leading luxury retailer in November of 2024.  \n\n  •Expansion of MVPD licensing internationally: We continue to license MVPDs internationally and have already successfully licensed several leading providers. Licensing unlicensed international MVPD providers presents a significant opportunity for expanding our business.\n\n  Research & Development \n\n  As demonstrated by our portfolio of industry recognized, widely-deployed, advanced technologies and IP, we have a long track record of innovating in the fields of media and semiconductors. We believe that ongoing investment in R&D is required for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve. Today, we have a collection of world-class talent and strong R&D capabilities. Our ongoing investment in R&D, which is supported by a strong industry network of partners, enables us to create original inventions which shape and anticipate future market trends in markets we serve. We continue to focus our R&D efforts on IP development and next generation technology solutions, including semiconductor hardware research, machine learning, generative AI and advanced algorithm development. Our R&D projects follow a forward-looking technology roadmap and execute a pragmatic technology strategy to position us with a sustainable competitive advantage for decades to come.\n\n  Competition\n\n  Due to the exclusionary nature of patent rights, we do not compete, in a traditional sense, with other patent holders for patent licensing relationships. Other patent holders do not have the same rights to the inventions and technologies encompassed by our patent portfolio. In any service, device, or piece of equipment that contains IP, the provider or manufacturer may need to obtain licenses from multiple holders of the IP. In licensing our patent portfolios, we compete with other patent holders for a share of the licensing fees that comprise the total potential revenue that is supported by a certain service or product. \n\n  7\n\n  Protecting Our Investment\n\n  We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our IP rights are critical for success. We protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including applying for patent protection domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately 12,250 patent and patent applications worldwide, including approximately 5,400 United States issued patents and 1,870 patent applications, as well as approximately 3,725 foreign issued patents and 1,250 patent applications. The last of our currently issued patents are set to expire in May 2044. From time to time, we acquire complementary IP portfolios. Our criteria for patent acquisitions include: compatibility with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the technical and legal strength of the patents, the actual or likely adoption by the industry and the economic value of the inventions.\n\n  Litigation\n\n  Although we are engaged with and have successfully licensed and transferred our technologies to many companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter into license agreements with us. Consequently, we have, at times, initiated litigation to enforce our IP rights and protect our investment. We view litigation as an instrument of last resort, and we use it only when our efforts to reach negotiated licenses have stalled or failed. If we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights.\n\n  Human Capital Resources\n\n  The opportunities for our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain a talented and engaged workforce. In particular, we are competing for technical talent and we need to offer not only robust and attractive compensation packages but also provide broad opportunities for our employees to make an impact, grow and develop. As of December 31, 2024, we had a talent base consisting of approximately 150 full-time employees, with substantially all of our employees located in the U.S.  \n\n  To enable our talent to actively contribute to, and have a positive impact on, our overall business and culture, we develop and maintain a set of programs and initiatives. These programs and initiatives include competitive compensation and benefits offerings, company culture initiatives, diversity and inclusion initiatives and goal and performance management. In support of these efforts, our Board of Directors monitors many of these programs and initiatives and provides guidance and feedback as appropriate. Our goal is to provide a work environment that empowers our teams and enables employees to enjoy a healthy and productive work-life balance for themselves, their families and our community.\n\n  Our incentives are based on merits, and we have a strong pay-for-performance culture. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with industry peers. Our compensation framework for employees reflects a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards and stock-based compensation. We offer competitive employee benefits that are designed to meet or exceed local laws.\n\n  We invest in the career growth of our employees by providing a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face (where possible), virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, training and external development. We also conduct annual assessments of employees to identify development needs based on department goals. We believe in the principles of a learning organization and strive to provide continuous educational opportunities for our employees. \n\n  We leverage our manager ecosystem to align corporate goals with employee objectives. We have delivered management training and supplementary resources to enable our management community to provide excellent support and guidance to their teams.  Employees are encouraged to create and align individual, functional and team-based goals, track performance against goals, write self-evaluations and provide feedback to supervisors or management members.\n\n  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.\n\n  Available Information\n\n  Our internet address is www.adeia.com, where we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our SEC reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of our website.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\n  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. \n\n  Risk Factor Summary\n\n  The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\n\n  Risks Relating to Our Business Operations\n\n  •The success of our IP licensing business is dependent on the strength of our patent portfolios.\n\n  •We enter into IP license agreements that have fixed expiration dates and if, upon expiration or termination, we are unable to renew or replace such license agreements on terms favorable to us, our results of operations could be harmed.\n\n  •If we fail to protect and enforce our IP rights, contract rights, and our confidential information, our business will suffer.\n\n  •If we fail to use adequate mechanisms to protect our technology and IP, or if a court fails to enforce our IP rights, our business will suffer. We cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged.\n\n  •Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our IP rights and to defend our licensing practices.\n\n  •Some of our IP license agreements contain “most favored nations” clauses, which may restrict our ability to offer more competitive terms to other customers in the future.\n\n  •We regularly make strategic decisions about our patent portfolios. Although we seek to focus our operations in areas where we see the potential for growth and to divest assets where we see more limited opportunities, dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks, and the anticipated benefits of such actions may not be realized.\n\n  •The structure and timing of our IP license agreements may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results.\n\n  •Some of our IP license agreements may convert to fully paid-up licenses at the expiration of their terms, or upon the occurrence of certain events, and in such event, we will not receive fees thereafter.\n\n  •The long-term success of our business is partially dependent on a royalty-based business model, which is inherently risky.\n\n  •A portion of our revenue and cash flow is dependent upon our customers’ sales and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.\n\n  Risks Related to Financial Matters\n\n  •We have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\n  •Our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly.\n\n  •We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations.\n\n  •Repayment of debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\n\n  •Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and negatively affect our business and financial condition.\n\n  •Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\n\n  9\n\n  Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\n\n  •New governmental regulations, new interpretations of existing laws, including legislative initiatives, or judicial or regulatory decisions regarding IP rights or the internet could cause uncertainties and result in harm to our business.\n\n  •Further deterioration of trade relations between the United States and China, other trade conflicts and barriers, economic sanctions, and national security protection policies could limit or prevent existing or potential customers from doing business with us.\n\n  Risks Related to the Separation\n\n  •We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Separation, and we may not enjoy the same benefits of diversity, leverage and market reputation that we previously enjoyed as a combined company.\n\n  •If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liability.\n\n  •In connection with the Separation, we assumed, and indemnified Xperi Inc. for certain liabilities. If we are required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, Xperi Inc. assumed, and must indemnify us for certain liabilities. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which we will be allocated responsibility, and Xperi Inc. may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\n\n  Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\n  •Our financial and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\n  •We may not pay dividends or pay dividends at a consistent rate, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n  •Our stock repurchase program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\n\n  •Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might delay or prevent a change of control transaction and depress the market price of our stock.\n\n  Risks Relating to Our Business Operations\n\n  The success of our IP licensing business is dependent on the strength of our patent portfolios.\n\n  We derive our revenue from patent licenses and technology transfer agreements. The success of our business depends on our ability to continue to develop, acquire, and enforce patents that address the evolving needs of the industries in which our current or future customers operate. We devote significant resources to developing and acquiring such patents and we must continue to do so in the future to remain competitive. Competition for acquiring such patents is intense and there is no assurance that we can continue to acquire such patents on favorable terms or develop such patents in a timely or economical fashion. Furthermore, our patents will expire in the future, the timing of which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current U.S. issued patents expire at various times through the next two decades. Consequently, we need to develop or acquire successful innovations and obtain patents on those innovations, or acquire new patents from third parties, before our current patents expire. Our failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n  We enter into IP license agreements that have fixed expiration dates and if, upon expiration or termination, we are unable to renew or replace such license agreements on terms favorable to us, our results of operations could be harmed.\n\n  We enter into IP license agreements that have fixed expiration dates. Upon expiration of such agreements, we need to renew or replace these agreements in order to maintain our revenue base. If we are unable to replace the revenue from an expiring license, either through a renewal of such license or with licenses from other customers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted as compared to periods prior to such expiration.\n\n  In addition, we may not be able to continue entering into licenses on terms that are favorable to us, which could harm our results of operations. While we have expanded our licensable technology portfolio through internal development and third-party acquisitions, there is no guarantee that these measures will lead to continued revenue. If we fail to continue to do business with our current customers, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n  10\n\n  Furthermore, a small number of our customers represent a significant percentage of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2024, five customers represented 49.6% of aggregate revenue. Agreements with some of these customers do not require any minimum license fees. Consumer demand for our technologies can shift quickly as many of the markets in which we serve are rapidly evolving. As a result, these customers may lose subscribers, which would reduce our revenue. Accordingly, the possibility that a customer, including a customer that represents a significant portion of our revenue, may reduce or eliminate its use of our technologies, presents a risk to our business.\n\n  If we fail to protect and enforce our IP rights, contract rights, and our confidential information, our business will suffer.\n\n  We rely primarily on a combination of license, development and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as IP laws, to protect our technology and IP. If we fail to protect our technology or IP, including by failing to enforce the terms of our contracts or IP rights through litigation, our customers and others may seek to use our technology and IP without a license or without the payment of license fees, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation. \n\n  Others may also develop new technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around our technologies. The growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to secure IP rights in a timely manner, our ability to convince third parties of the applicability of our IP rights to their products and services, and our ability to enforce our IP rights.\n\n  We attempt to obtain patent protection for our innovations, and our license agreements typically include both issued patents and pending patent applications. If we fail to file for patents in a timely manner or if the patents issued to us do not cover all of the inventions disclosed in our patent applications, others could use portions of our technology and IP without a license or without the payment of license fees. For example, our business may suffer if we are unable to obtain patent protection in a timely manner from the US Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n  If we fail to use adequate mechanisms to protect our technology and IP, or if a court fails to enforce our IP rights, our business will suffer. We cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged.\n\n  Further, the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries may not protect our technology and IP to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement regimes of the U.S. In certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our technology and IP adequately against unauthorized use, which could adversely affect our business. \n\n  At times, we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our IP rights, including matters related to our license fees and other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our customers, prospective customers, or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. Any such disputes, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend or settle and could adversely impact our revenue. Damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in disputes like these could be significant and could be disruptive to our business.\n\n  Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our IP rights and to defend our licensing practices.\n\n  While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling products, services or solutions that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we proactively approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies, including those that may be reluctant to pay for licenses to our IP. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products and services, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. For example, in November 2024, our affiliates filed complaints against The Walt Disney Company and certain of its affiliates in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware as well as in courts in Germany, The Netherlands and Brazil alleging infringement of our patents. This and other legal or administrative actions may prove costly. In addition, in connection with such legal or administrative actions to defend our IP rights and our licensing practices, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as Inter Partes Review proceedings in the USPTO, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity. Further, in certain jurisdictions where we may pursue protections of our IP rights, if we are unsuccessful in litigation, we may be liable for the costs of defendants that receive favorable rulings. Given the nature of our business, such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n  11\n\n  Some of our IP license agreements contain “most favored nations” clauses, which may restrict our ability to offer more competitive terms to other customers in the future.\n\n  Some of our license agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses, which typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another customer on more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing customers. We have entered into a number of license agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements. These agreements may obligate us to provide different, more favorable, terms to customers, which could, if applied, result in lower revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation terms included in our license agreements, these contracts are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that, if enforced, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Disputes over such terms may be costly, difficult and time-consuming to resolve, and could divert our management’s attention and resources. \n\n  We regularly make strategic decisions about our patent portfolios. Although we seek to focus our operations in areas where we see the potential for growth and to divest assets where we see more limited opportunities, dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks, and the anticipated benefits of such actions may not be realized.\n\n  From time to time, we intend to make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio, whether through a formal portfolio review or opportunistic dispositions. Cost savings expectations of any portfolio review are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected or actual cost savings from any such action. Our portfolio review activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities. Any assets that we divest could turn out to be more valuable than we had anticipated, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic decision about our patent portfolio.\n\n  The structure and timing of our IP license agreements may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results.\n\n  From time to time, we enter into IP license agreements that include pricing or payment terms that may result in quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year fluctuations in our revenue and cash flows. Further, we recognize both recurring and non-recurring revenue in various periods depending on the timing and content of the contractual arrangements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition.” As a result, the effects of these terms may cause our aggregate annual revenue to fluctuate significantly or to grow less rapidly than annual growth in the applicable end market. Additionally, our customers may fail to pay, delay payment of, or underpay what they owe to us under our IP license agreements, which may in turn require us to enforce our contractual rights through legal proceedings, resulting in payment amounts and timing different than expected based on the terms of our license agreements. This also may cause our revenue and cash flows to fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year basis.\n\n  Some of our IP license agreements may convert to fully paid-up licenses at the expiration of their terms, or upon the occurrence of certain events, and in such event we will not receive fees thereafter.\n\n  We have entered and may continue to enter into semiconductor IP license agreements that automatically convert to fully paid-up licenses upon expiration of a specified term or upon the occurrence of certain events. We may not receive further fees from customers for any licensed technology under those agreements if they convert to fully paid-up licenses because such customers will be entitled to continue using some, if not all, of the relevant IP or technology under the terms of the license agreements without further payment, even if relevant patents or technologies are still in effect. If we cannot find another source of fees to replace the fees from these license agreements converting to fully paid-up licenses, our results of operations following such conversion would be materially adversely affected. \n\n  The long-term success of our business is partially dependent on a royalty-based business model, which is inherently risky.\n\n  The long-term success of our business is partially dependent on royalties paid to us by customers. Fees under our licenses may be based upon, among other things, the number of subscribers for Pay-TV, a per-unit sold basis, or a fixed quarterly or annual amount. We are dependent upon our ability to structure, negotiate, and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of such fees, as well as upon our customers’ compliance with their agreements. We face risks inherent in a license-based business model, many of which are outside of our control, such as the following:\n\n  •the number of subscribers our Pay-TV customers have;\n\n  •the rate of adoption and incorporation of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers, assemblers, foundries, and manufacturers of consumer and communication electronics;\n\n  12\n\n  •the demand for products that incorporate our licensed technology;\n\n  •the cyclicality of supply and demand for products using our licensed technology;\n\n  •the impact of economic downturns; and\n\n  •the impact of poor financial performance of our customers.\n\n  A portion of our revenue and cash flow is dependent upon our customers’ sales and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.\n\n  A portion of our revenue is dependent on sales by our customers that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns, outbreaks or pandemics, country-specific natural disasters, hostilities, or armed conflicts impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our customers’ products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our customers receive for their covered products and services. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.\n\n  We depend on our customers to continue paying their obligations under their license agreements to provide us cash flow, and our customers may delay, refuse to or be unable to make payments to us due to financial difficulties or otherwise.\n\n  Most of our customers sign multi-year agreements with us providing for periodic payments through the term of the agreement. As such, we are dependent upon our customers to make timely payments to provide us with our cash flows. A number of our customers may face severe financial difficulties from time to time, which may result in their inability to make payments to us in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, we have had a history of, and we may in the future experience, customers that delay or refuse to make payments owed to us under IP license or settlement agreements, which may result in us filing lawsuits to enforce our rights. For example, in October of 2023, our affiliates filed a complaint against Shaw Cablesystems G.P. and Shaw Satellite G.P. (together “Shaw”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging breach of contract for failure to pay royalties under a license agreement. Such lawsuits can require us to devote significant time and resources to enforce our rights. Our customers may also merge with or may shift the manufacture of licensed products to companies that are not currently customers of our technology. This could make the collection process complex, difficult and costly, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n  It is difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our IP license agreements, and this may cause us to lose revenue.\n\n  The terms of our IP license agreements often require our customers to report on the number of subscribers or unit sales on a periodic basis. However, we may have difficulty independently determining whether our customers are reporting such data accurately. In addition, although our license terms generally give us the right to audit books and records of our customers to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our customers and, in some cases, may not be cost justified based on our understanding of our customers’ businesses. \n\n  We face competitive risks in the provision of IP licenses to the industries that we serve, including the entertainment industry and electronic industries.\n\n  Due to the exclusionary nature of patent rights, we do not compete, in a traditional sense, with other patent holders for patent licensing relationships. Other patent holders do not have the same rights to the inventions and technologies encompassed by our patent portfolio. However, our future success depends on our ability to establish and maintain licensing relationships with companies in the industries that we currently serve and may enter in the future, including Pay-TV service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, semiconductor and equipment manufacturers, and the entertainment and electronics businesses.\n\n  Our pursuit of acquisitions and divestures may adversely affect our business operations or stock price if we cannot successfully execute our strategies.\n\n  We have made several acquisitions and it is our current plan to continue to acquire assets, patents or companies that we believe are strategic to our future business. Acquisitions involve challenges in terms of successful integration of IP, technologies, and employees.\n\n  13\n\n  Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively, requiring our management to:\n\n  •recruit, hire, and train additional personnel;\n\n  •implement and improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls;\n\n  •maintain our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the revenue and cash we forecast and generate;\n\n  •manage multiple concurrent IP development projects; and\n\n  •manage operations in multiple time zones with different cultures and languages.\n\n  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the other acquisitions we may complete in the future, and we may not be able to incorporate any acquired IP or technologies with our existing operations, or integrate personnel, systems, processes and operations from the acquired businesses, in which case our business could be harmed.\n\n  Financing for future acquisitions may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we use our equity securities to fund the acquisition, it may result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate for any of our businesses, we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully, finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired technologies or employees into our existing business and operations. Future acquisitions and divestitures may not be well-received by the investment community, which may cause the value of our stock to fall. We cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully complete any acquisition or divestiture in the future. Further, the terms of our indebtedness constrain our ability to make and finance additional acquisitions or divestitures.\n\n  We are exposed to the risks related to international sales and operations.\n\n  We derive a portion of our total revenue from operations outside of the United States. Therefore, we face exposure to risks of operating in many foreign countries, including:\n\n  •difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties, regulations and compliance requirements;\n\n  •unexpected changes in political or regulatory environments;\n\n  •earnings and cash flows that may be subject to tax withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs;\n\n  •exchange controls or other restrictions;\n\n  •political and economic instability and trade conflict; \n\n  •import and export restrictions and other trade barriers;\n\n  •difficulties in maintaining overseas subsidiaries;\n\n  •difficulties in obtaining approval for significant transactions; and\n\n  •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n  Any one or more of the above factors could adversely affect our international operations and could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The results of our operations will be dependent to a large extent upon the global economy. Geopolitical factors such as terrorist activities, armed conflict, global health conditions, outbreaks or pandemics that adversely affect the global economy may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\n  We are also subject to risks associated with compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits companies and their employees and intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining an advantage or benefits, and requires public companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Under these laws, companies may be held liable for actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other partners or representatives. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar laws, governmental authorities could commence an investigation or seek to impose civil and criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n  14\n\n  Our systems, networks and business activities and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations are subject to cybersecurity and stability risks, including information technology system failures, and security breaches.\n\n  Despite our provisions for system redundancy and the implementation and integration of security and risk management measures within our internal and external information technology and networking systems, our information technology systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations may be subject to security breaches, unauthorized access (malicious or accidental), misuse of information by authorized users, data leaks or unintentional exposure of information, failed processes or other bugs, loss of data, damages from computer viruses or malware, natural disasters, terrorism, telecommunication failures or disruption of service. In addition, our business activities depend on the ability to store and transmit confidential or proprietary information and data securely on our systems and third-party systems and over private, and public networks. \n\n  Any compromise of our ability to store or transmit such information and data securely or reliably, and any costs associated with preventing, assessing or eliminating such problems, could harm our business. Our activities are subject to a number of cybersecurity and stability risks:\n\n  •our own or licensed encryption and authentication technology, or access or security procedures, may be compromised, breached or otherwise be insufficient to ensure the security of confidential or proprietary information or data, including customer information;\n\n  •we could experience damage from unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware, system interference or destruction, “denial of service” attacks and other disruptive problems, whether intentional or accidental, that may inhibit or prevent access to our websites and infrastructure, or cause confidential or proprietary information to be disclosed to a perpetrator, others or the general public;\n\n  •hackers could circumvent our integrated risk management processes and security measures and misappropriate our information, or our customers’ proprietary information or content, interrupt operations, or jeopardize our licensing arrangements, many of which are contingent on our sustaining appropriate security protections; or\n\n  •we could inadvertently disclose confidential or proprietary information.\n\n  Each of the foregoing risks also applies to the computer systems of third parties that we rely upon in our operations, including providers of cloud storage and services. The occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business, hurt our ability to license IP and collect revenue, threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology, harm our reputation, increase the costs of our ongoing cybersecurity monitoring, protections and enhancements, require us to incur significant expenses to evaluate, address, remediate or resolve such issues and expose us to litigation and other liabilities. Because some of our technologies are intended to inhibit use of or restrict access to our customers’ IP, we may become the target of hackers or other persons whose use of, or access to, our customers’ IP is affected by our technologies. Also, hackers may, for financial gain or other motives, seek to infiltrate or damage our systems, or obtain sensitive business information or customer information from our systems. Further, the use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients. We also may be exposed to customer claims, or other liability, in connection with any security breach or inadvertent disclosure. We may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches, hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate and remediate problems caused by such breaches, attacks or failures.\n\n  If we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\n\n  Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our key management, IP, sales, marketing, legal and finance personnel, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. None of our senior management or key sales personnel are bound by written employment contracts that require them to remain with us for a specified period. In addition, we do not currently maintain key-person life insurance covering our key personnel or have restrictions on their post-employment ability to solicit our employees, contractors or customers if key personnel voluntarily terminate their employment. The loss of any of our senior management or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of these executives to effectively drive execution of our business strategy, and on the ability of our management team to work together effectively.\n\n  15\n\n  Our success also depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing, legal and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively, both individually and as a group. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the technology industry in which we operate, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we fail to attract and retain qualified employees, including internationally, our ability to grow our business could be harmed. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment to potential candidates. Volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. \n\n  Risks Related to Financial Matters\n\n  We have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\n  As of December 31, 2024, we had $487.1 million of total debt outstanding under our 2024 Term Loan B. Our 2024 Term Loan B is guaranteed by us and our wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors’ assets. \n\n  Our indebtedness may:\n\n  •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n  •limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n  •require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\n  •limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\n  •increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\n\n  Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n  Our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly.\n\n  As of December 31, 2024, we had $487.1 million of outstanding indebtedness that is subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. At December 31, 2024, a 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt throughout a one-year period would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of approximately $4.8 million. Any significant increase in our interest expense could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and also our ability to pay dividends in the future. If the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate through one or more rate hikes, the increases would likely impact the borrowing rate on our outstanding indebtedness and increase our interest expense.\n\n  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations.\n\n  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due.\n\n  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to timely fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets, use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to maximize the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\n\n  16\n\n  Repayment of debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\n\n  Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Additionally, distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and would be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax which could reduce the net cash available for principal and interest payments.\n\n  If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could increase our operating costs and affect our ability to operate our business.\n\n  Ensuring that we have adequate internal controls and procedures in place to facilitate the production of accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We are continually in the process of documenting, reviewing and, if appropriate, improving our internal controls and procedures in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify areas for further attention or improvement, implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant amount of time to complete. We have in the past identified, and may in the future identify, significant deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls, which have been or will in the future need to be remediated.\n\n  Finally, in the event we make a significant acquisition, we may face significant challenges in implementing the required processes and procedures in the acquired operations. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to investors’ perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements.\n\n  Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and negatively affect our business and financial condition.\n\n  We are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, as well as taxes in various international jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax to accrue in each tax jurisdiction. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including from the passage of new tax laws, changes in the mix of our profitability from state to state and from country to country, the amount of payments from the Company’s U.S. entities to related foreign entities, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities and changes in accounting for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, by changes in the amount of pre-tax income derived from countries with high statutory income tax rates, or by changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including changes in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rate could be unfavorably affected by changes in the amount of sales to customers in countries with high withholding tax rates. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\n\n  Further, U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax jurisdictions may examine our income tax returns, including income tax returns of acquired companies and acquired tax attributes included therein. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. In making such assessments, we exercise judgment in estimating our provision for income taxes. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination from these examinations will not be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome from these examinations may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\n  For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminated the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal or defer this capitalization and amortization requirement, it is not certain that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. The new requirement adversely impacts our cash tax liability for 2024, although the negative cash impact is expected to decline annually over the amortization period.\n\n  17\n\n  Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\n\n  As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating losses of approximately $2.3 million and $861.2 million, respectively, on a tax return basis. A portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in 2025. Net operating losses that expire unused will be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than fifty-percent (50%) change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. \n\n  We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed by us.\n\n  If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to payment of income taxes in the various states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, we could be exposed to unexpected costs, expenses, penalties and fees as a result of our noncompliance in which case our business could be harmed.\n\n  As our business grows and expands, we will continue to do business in an increasing number of states nationally and in new foreign jurisdictions. By engaging in business activities in these states and foreign jurisdictions, we become subject to their various laws and regulations, including the payment of income taxes on revenue generated from activities in those states and foreign jurisdictions.\n\n  The laws and regulations governing the payment of income taxes are numerous, complex, and vary among states and foreign jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations requiring the payment of income taxes in one or more states and foreign jurisdictions where we do business, we could be subject to significant costs, expenses, penalties and fees in which case our business would be harmed.\n\n  Our subsidiaries have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, significant valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, and the recording and release of such allowances may have a material impact on our results of operations.\n\n  The need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets are realizable. In making such assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. New facts and circumstances, historic profits or losses, and future financial results may require us to reevaluate our valuation allowance positions which could potentially affect our effective tax rate.\n\n  We continue to monitor the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets, including those for which a valuation allowance is recorded. There can be no assurance that we will generate profits in future periods enabling us to fully realize our deferred tax assets. We have applied a valuation allowance on certain state, and foreign deferred tax assets to the extent they are not realizable by utilizing deferred tax liabilities as sources of income. The timing of recording a valuation allowance or the reversal of such valuation allowance is subject to objective factors that cannot be readily predicted in advance. Both the establishment of a valuation allowance and the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance may have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n  The investment of our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt and equity securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\n\n  At December 31, 2024, we held approximately $78.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $31.6 million in short-term investments. Short-term investments typically include various financial securities such as corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes, commercial paper, treasury and agency notes and bills, and money market funds. Although we invest in high quality securities, ongoing financial events have at times adversely impacted the general credit, liquidity, market and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities. Changes in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, government fiscal policies, and global economic and market conditions may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. We may in the future have a need to sell investments before their maturity dates, which could result in losses on the sale of those investments. The financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n  18\n\n  Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\n\n  New governmental regulations, new interpretations of existing laws, including legislative initiatives, or judicial or regulatory decisions regarding IP rights or the internet could cause uncertainties and result in harm to our business.\n\n  Our business relies in part on the uniform and historically consistent application of U.S. patent laws, rules, and regulations. The standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may evolve, particularly as new technologies develop. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States has modified some legal standards applied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the examination of U.S. patent applications, which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and may increase the likelihood of challenges to patents we obtain or license. For example, our patents continue to face challenges in the U.S. from Inter Partes Review proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Historically these types of proceedings have a high rate of invalidation of patents, and patents we have asserted in litigation have been and may continue to be invalidated in such proceedings. Additionally, there have been and may be bills introduced in the U.S. Congress relating to patent law that could adversely impact our business depending on the scope of any bills that may ultimately be enacted into law. Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection, or to enforce our patents against parties using them without a license or payment of royalties. These changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement of our patent rights. In addition, potential changes in the law, such as with respect to patent exhaustion and permissible licensing practices, could have a negative effect on our ability to license our patents and, therefore, on the royalties we can collect. We may be required to reevaluate and modify our licensing practices and strategies in response to such changes and, given the nature of our business, any resulting modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n  Many laws and regulations are pending and may be adopted by the U.S. federal government, individual states and local jurisdictions and other countries with respect to the internet. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including IP rights, privacy and taxation. These types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions. Changes to these laws, or the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, expose us to increased litigation risk, substantial defense costs and other liabilities or require us or our customers to change business practices. It is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business. We may have significant expenses associated with staying apprised of and in compliance with local, state, federal, and international legislation and regulation of our business and in presenting the Company’s positions on proposed laws and regulations.\n\n  Further deterioration of trade relations between the United States and China, other trade conflicts and barriers, economic sanctions, and national security protection policies could limit or prevent existing or potential customers from doing business with us.\n\n  The increased trade conflicts between the United States and its major trading partners in recent years, evidenced by trade restrictions such as tariffs, taxes, export controls, economic sanctions, foreign investment controls and enhanced policies designed to protect national security, have had and may continue to have adverse impact on our revenue if such policies continue. In particular, our business has been impacted due to increased and ongoing trade conflicts between the United States and China. Further United States government actions to protect domestic economic and security interests could lead to further restrictions or additional or increased conflicts. Moreover, growing trade conflicts and uncertainties and foreign investment controls may lead to decreased use of foreign-owned technologies in China and other countries, due to efforts by foreign governments and enterprises to find alternative sources of supply, the development of proprietary domestic technologies, and the reduction of reliance on foreign technology sources. Any such conflicts or trends could have a material adverse impact on our revenue. In addition, any failure by us to comply with these complex restrictions, or other restrictions that may be imposed in the future, in the United States or internationally, could subject us to fines and penalties, require changes to our business practices and result in reputational harm.  \n\n  Risks Related to the Separation\n\n  We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Separation, and we may not enjoy the same benefits of diversity, leverage and market reputation that we previously enjoyed as a combined company. \n\n  On October 1, 2022, we completed the separation of our product business from our intellectual property (“IP”) licensing business, resulting in two independently traded companies: Xperi Inc., the new holding company for the spun-out product business, and Adeia Inc., our company. We undertook the Separation to achieve certain intended benefits including:\n\n  •eliminating competing priorities for capital allocation between the product and IP licensing businesses;\n\n  •enabling the respective management teams to better focus on strengthening their core businesses and operations;\n\n  19\n\n  •enhancing operational flexibility for both businesses, particularly in dealing with suppliers and customers;\n\n  •streamlining the investment profiles of both businesses and enhancing their marketability; and\n\n  •improving access to talent by allowing each company to capitalize on their distinct cultures and recruitment strategies.\n\n  Our business (or portions thereof) has historically benefited from our (and, prior to the Mergers, TiVo Corporation and Xperi Corporation’s) operating diversity and purchasing power, as well as opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with our other businesses, including those businesses that were allocated to Xperi Inc. in connection with the Separation. Accordingly, as a result of the Separation and distribution, we will not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and may not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets. Additionally, as a result of the Separation and distribution, we may become more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if Xperi Inc. had remained part of our organizational structure. \n\n  If the Separation does not continue to provide the benefits we intend, there could be a disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our business and impairment of our key customer relationships. Furthermore, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events.  \n\n  If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liability.\n\n  The distribution was conditioned on a tax opinion from outside counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to us, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the “Tax Opinion”). Additionally, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the “IRS Ruling”). The IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from us and Xperi Inc., regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters.\n\n  The Tax Opinion also relied on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling. Notwithstanding the Tax Opinion and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the Tax Opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\n\n  If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, then our stockholders that received shares of Xperi Inc. common stock in the distribution would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares (including any fractional shares sold on behalf of such stockholder) on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities, and we would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the distribution in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of Xperi Inc. common stock distributed to our stockholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such stock. In addition, if certain related transactions, including certain transactions undertaken pursuant to our internal reorganization and business realignment, through which we entered into a series of internal reorganization transactions with Xperi Inc. to align our respective product and IP licensing businesses (the “Internal Reorganization and Business Realignment”), that are intended to qualify for tax-free treatment, fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state, local tax and/or foreign tax law, we and Xperi Inc. could incur significant tax liabilities and/or lose significant tax attributes under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.\n\n  Even if the distribution otherwise constitutes a tax-free transaction to stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, we may be required to recognize corporate level tax on the distribution and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code if, as a result of the all-stock merger of equals transaction consummated on June 1, 2020 between TiVo Corporation and Xperi Corporation and their respective consolidated subsidiaries (the “Mergers”) or other transactions considered part of a plan with the distribution, there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in us or Xperi Inc. \n\n  20\n\n  Following the Mergers, and in anticipation of the distribution, we sought and received the IRS Ruling, which included a ruling from the IRS regarding the proper manner and methodology for measuring the common ownership of our stock and the stock of TiVo Corporation and Xperi Corporation for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under Section 355(e) of the Code. The Tax Opinion relied on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, as well as certain factual representations from us as to the extent of common ownership in the stock of TiVo Corporation and Xperi Corporation immediately prior to the Mergers. Based on the representations made by us as to the common ownership in the stock of TiVo Corporation and Xperi Corporation immediately prior to the Mergers and assuming the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, the Tax Opinion concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of Section 355(e) as a result of the Mergers. Notwithstanding the Tax Opinion and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine that the distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to us if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings provided by us are not correct or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the Tax Opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\n\n  Under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Xperi Inc. on October 1, 2022 (the “Tax Matters Agreement”), Xperi Inc. is generally obligated to indemnify us against taxes imposed on us that result from the failure of the distribution to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any taxes imposed on us due to the application of Section 355(e) to the distribution), to the extent such failure is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Xperi Inc. or its affiliates’ stock, assets or business, or any breach of Xperi Inc.’s representations, covenants or obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement (or certain other agreements it entered into in connection with the separation and distribution) or any breach by Xperi Inc. or its affiliates of representations made in any representation letter provided in connection with the Tax Opinion. \n\n  If the distribution fails to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the Mergers and the distribution, then under the Tax Matters Agreement, we and Xperi Inc. would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with our relative market capitalizations as of the distribution date (determined based on the average trading prices of each company’s stock during the ten trading days beginning on the distribution date).  \n\n  If the distribution or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. As described above, we may be entitled to indemnification from Xperi Inc. under the Tax Matters Agreement for all or a portion of such tax liabilities.  However, if Xperi Inc. fails to indemnify us, as required by the Tax Matters Agreement, or if we are required to recognize tax on the distribution or certain related transactions under circumstances where we are not entitled to indemnification, or if such indemnities are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of such tax, we could be subject to significant tax liability. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Xperi Inc. any amounts that are subject to indemnification, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\n  In connection with the Separation we assumed, and indemnified Xperi Inc. for, certain liabilities. If we are required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, Xperi Inc. assumed, and must indemnify us for certain liabilities. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which we will be allocated responsibility, and Xperi Inc. may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\n\n  Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, the employee matters agreement, and the tax matters agreement with Xperi Inc., we agreed to assume, and indemnify Xperi Inc. for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which could include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments. Payments pursuant to these indemnities could be significant and could negatively impact our business. \n\n  Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to Xperi Inc., including those related to Xperi Inc.’s business. Xperi Inc. agreed to indemnify us for such liabilities, but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Xperi Inc. any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n  21\n\n  Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\n  Our financial and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\n  Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. Because our operating results are difficult to predict, one should not rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period or that could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives include those listed in this “Risk Factors” section of this report and the following:\n\n  •the consequences of the separation transaction;\n\n  •the timing of, and compliance with the terms and conditions for, payment by third parties to us of fees (including royalties) under IP license agreements;\n\n  •fluctuations in our royalties caused by the pricing terms of certain of our IP license agreements;\n\n  •the amount of our revenue;\n\n  •changes in the level of our operating expenses;\n\n  •the substantial research and development expenses that we have incurred and will continue to incur in connection with the development of new IP, as well as the uncertainty that such new technologies will generate material revenue for the Company;\n\n  •our ability to protect or enforce our IP rights or the terms of our agreements;\n\n  •legal proceedings affecting our patents, patent applications or IP license agreements;\n\n  •the timing of the introduction of new technologies that replace technologies covered by our IP;\n\n  •the timing of establishing new IP license agreements and expiration of existing IP license agreements;\n\n  •changes in generally accepted accounting principles including new accounting standards which may materially affect our revenue recognition and the comparability between revenue recognition and cash flow from customer royalties;\n\n  •cyclical fluctuations in semiconductor and consumer electronics markets generally;\n\n  •supply chain constraints, and attendant effects, including but not limited to increased costs or shipping delays that may impact our customers;\n\n  •adverse labor market conditions, and any impacts on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\n  •inflation and/or changes in central bank interest rate policies;\n\n  •expenses related to and the financial impact of possible acquisitions of other businesses and the integration of such businesses;\n\n  •expenses related to and the financial impact of the disposition of assets, including post-closing indemnification obligations; and\n\n  •adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the U.S. or other major economies in which we do business as a result of the threat of terrorism, military actions taken by the U.S. or its allies, civil unrest, hostilities, global health concerns, outbreaks, pandemics, natural disasters or generally weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions.\n\n  Due to fluctuations in our operating results, reports from market and security analysts, litigation-related developments, and other factors including general market conditions, the price at which our common stock will trade may be volatile. In future periods, if our revenue, royalties, cash flows or operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.\n\n  We may not pay dividends or pay dividends at a consistent rate, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n  We anticipate that all dividends and stock repurchases will be paid out of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to the final determination by our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, actual and forecasted cash flows, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital including business combinations, economic condition and other factors considered relevant by management and the Board of Directors. Since July 2020, the Board has declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per share. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n  22\n\n  Our stock repurchase program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\n\n  In June 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock dependent on market conditions, share price, and other factors. In April 2021 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0 million of stock repurchases under this program, under which $172.2 million was utilized for stock repurchases, leaving the total authorized amount available for repurchase under the program at $77.8 million. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the existing share repurchase authorization up to a total of $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, the total amount available for repurchase under the plan was $180.0 million. The amount of repurchases under our stock repurchase program will vary depending on various factors. The timing of repurchases is at our discretion and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline. The timing of repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we effected repurchases. Furthermore, we may engage in mergers, acquisitions, or other activity that could result in us reducing or discontinuing share repurchases for a period of time.\n\n  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law might delay or prevent a change of control transaction and depress the market price of our stock.\n\n  Various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws might have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of our company. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Certain of these provisions eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors, authorize the board to issue “blank check” preferred stock, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, eliminate the right of stockholders to call special meetings, and establish advance notice procedures for director nominations by stockholders and the submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met. Any of these provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock.\n\n  Decreased effectiveness of stock-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\n\n  We have historically used stock options, restricted stock grants and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of employee compensation in order to align employees’ interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. We incur significant compensation costs associated with our stock-based compensation programs. Failure to obtain stockholder approval of equity compensation plans or changes to the plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant stock-based compensation to employees in the future. As a result, we may find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, and any such difficulty could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\n\n  Use of our common stock for future acquisitions may be limited.\n\n  Our ability to use common stock for future acquisitions without triggering an ownership change for the purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code will likely be limited for three-years following the Mergers. To the extent that we are unable to use our common stock to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital through debt, equity financings or operational growth.\n\n  Reliance on internally generated cash or debt to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we may be required to reduce the scope of any expansion or redirect resources committed to internal purposes. Inability to use our common stock in acquisitions may hinder our ability to actively make future acquisitions and recruit talent through acquisitions and restricts the flexibility in which we can make acquisition bids.\n\n  23\n\n  Stock transfer restrictions in our certificate of incorporation may act as an anti-takeover device.\n\n  Our certificate of incorporation includes certain transfer restrictions intended to preserve certain of our tax attributes. Such transfer restrictions will apply to future transfers made by 4.91% stockholders, transferees related to a 4.91% stockholder, transferees acting in coordination with a 4.91% stockholder, or transfers that would result in a stockholder becoming a 4.91% stockholder in order to avoid potential limitation of such tax attributes pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. Such transfer restrictions will expire on the earlier of (i) the repeal of Section 382 or any successor statute if our board of directors determines that such restrictions are no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of certain tax benefits, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year to which our board of directors determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward, (iii) the third anniversary of the Mergers, or (iv) such other date as our board of directors shall fix in accordance with the certificate of incorporation.\n\n  The transfer restrictions described above could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, a large block of our common stock. This may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging existing or potential investors from acquiring our stock or additional shares of our stock. It is also possible that the transfer restrictions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\n\n  Our certificate of incorporation contains forum limitations for certain disputes between us and our stockholders that could limit the ability of stockholders to bring claims against us and our directors, officers and employees in jurisdictions preferred by stockholders.\n\n  Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative lawsuit brought on our stockholders, (ii) any lawsuit against our current or former directors, officers, employees, stockholders or agents asserting a breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any such current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent to us or our stockholders, (iii) any lawsuit asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, stockholder or agent arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL, our charter or our bylaws (each, as in effect from time to time), or (iv) any lawsuit asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, stockholder or agent governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The foregoing forum provisions may prevent or limit a stockholder’s ability to file a lawsuit in a judicial forum that it prefers for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, stockholders or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits, make them more difficult or expensive to pursue, and result in outcomes that are less favorable to such stockholders than outcomes that may have been attainable in other jurisdictions.\n\n  In addition, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing forum provisions in the certificate of incorporation, courts may find the foregoing forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in certain cases that the foregoing forum provisions purport to address, including claims brought under the Securities Act. If this were to occur in any particular lawsuit, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such lawsuit in other jurisdictions or resolving lawsuits involving similar claims in multiple jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",
