      "text": "ITEM 1.     BUSINESS\n\nCompany Overview\n\nWe are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing, employment, and lifestyle needs of Californians and create value for our shareholders. Current operations consist of land planning and entitlement, land development, commercial land sales and leasing, leasing of land for mineral royalties, water asset management and sales, grazing leases, farming, and ranch operations. In 2025, our real estate operations will expand to include residential leasing tied to our multi-family project, Terra Vista at Tejon, which began development in 2024, further diversifying our portfolio and enhancing long-term recurring revenue streams.\n\nThese activities are performed through our five reporting segments:\n\nOur prime asset is approximately 270,000 acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is 15 miles east of Bakersfield. We create value by securing entitlements for our land, facilitating infrastructure development, strategic land planning, monetization of land through development and/or sales, and conservation in order to maximize the highest and best use for our land. We are involved in nine joint ventures that either own, develop, and/or operate real estate properties. We enter into joint ventures as a means to facilitate the development of portions of our land.\n\n4\n\nBusiness Objectives and Strategies\n\nOur primary business objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through the improvement and monetization of our land-based assets.  A key element of our strategy is to entitle and then develop large-scale mixed-use master planned residential and commercial/industrial real estate development projects to serve the growing populations of Southern and Central California. An active example of this strategy is the TRCC mixed-use development, which was entitled and prevailed in litigation in 2007. \n\nOur mixed-use master planned residential developments have been approved to collectively include up to 35,278 housing units, and more than 35 million square feet of commercial space.  We have obtained entitlements on MV and the first approved final map for the project consisting of 401 residential lots and parcels for hospitality, amenities, and public uses. The Grapevine at Tejon Ranch, or Grapevine, has approved entitlements for 12,000 units and 5 million square feet of commercial development. Centennial at Tejon Ranch, or Centennial, had entitlements approved in 2018, and received legislative approvals in 2019 from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.\n\nThe Centennial approvals were litigated in two lawsuits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in May 2019 and the Company has since worked on defending and addressing the ongoing litigation, including considering all options to address the Superior Court’s January 2022 decision and the Superior Court’s March 22, 2023 final judgment. On May 26, 2023, we filed a Notice of Appeal, thereby appealing the Superior Court’s decision to the Second District of the California Court of Appeal. On June 27, 2023, CBD/CNPS cross-appealed the Superior Court’s ruling. During the appeal process the Superior Court’s order of \n\n5\n\nthe rescission of project approvals have been placed on hold. The appeal has been fully briefed and a hearing has been scheduled for April 4, 2025.\n\nWe are actively executing our value creation strategy through construction, commercial sales, and leasing at our commercial and industrial center, TRCC.  As part of this strategy, we commenced construction in 2024 of the first phase of Terra Vista at Tejon, a multi-family community within TRCC. This development is located on a 22-acre site immediately north of the Outlets at Tejon. The first phase includes 228 multi-family residences across seven apartment buildings, along with a clubhouse featuring a pool and fitness facilities. The project was approved for a maximum of 495 multi-family residences. We remain on track to deliver the first phase on budget and on schedule, with residential leasing expected to begin in the second quarter of 2025. All of these efforts are supported by diverse revenue streams generated from other operations including: farming, mineral resources, ranch operations, and our various joint ventures.\n\nTerra Vista at Tejon\n\n6\n\n7\n\nPercentage of Total Revenue1 by Segment:\n\n1 Charts present segment revenues and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, which has been included in real estate, while other income components are excluded.\n\n8\n\nNote: Our Resort Residential reporting segment did not report revenues in the periods reported herein.\n\n9\n\nThe following table shows the revenues from continuing operations, segment operating results and identifiable assets of each of our continuing segments for the last three years:\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS\n\n(Amounts in thousands of dollars)\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n202420232022\n\nRevenues\n\nReal estate - commercial/industrial$12,552 $11,758 $40,515 \n\nMineral resources10,214 14,524 21,595 \n\nFarming13,925 13,950 13,001 \n\nRanch operations5,195 4,507 4,106 \n\nSegment revenues41,886 44,739 79,217 \n\nSegment Operating Results\n\nReal estate - commercial/industrial$15,523 $10,573 $31,911 \n\nReal estate - resort/residential(2,615)(1,528)(1,629)\n\nMineral resources3,162 5,839 8,626 \n\nFarming(3,626)(1,307)(6,810)\n\nRanch operations331 (536)(918)\n\nSegment operating results 1\n\n12,775 13,041 31,180 \n\nReconciling items:\n\nInvestment income2,273 2,557 634 \n\nOther (loss) income(292)(138)1,088 \n\nCorporate expenses(11,092)(9,872)(9,699)\n\nIncome before income taxes3,664 5,588 23,203 \n\nIdentifiable Assets by Segment 2\n\nReal estate - commercial/industrial$98,185 $73,105 $74,292 \n\nReal estate - resort/residential330,513 321,216 312,956 \n\nMineral resources54,658 52,068 48,780 \n\nFarming54,478 52,094 45,814 \n\nRanch operations2,658 2,072 1,945 \n\nCorporate67,506 76,968 83,004 \n\nTotal assets$607,998 $577,523 $566,791 \n\n1 Segment operating results are comprised of revenues and equity in earnings of unconsolidated  joint ventures, less segment expenses, excluding investment income, other income (loss), corporate expenses, and income taxes.\n\n2 Identifiable Assets by Segment include both assets directly identified with those operations and an allocable share of jointly used assets. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, refundable and deferred income taxes, land, buildings, and improvements.  Commercial/Industrial also includes buildings and improvements.\n\n10\n\nReal Estate Development Overview\n\nOur real estate operations consist of the following activities: real estate development, commercial land sales and leasing, land planning and entitlement, and conservation. During 2024 we began our first residential development, Terra Vista at Tejon, a multi-family project community at TRCC with leasing scheduled to begin during the second quarter of 2025.\n\nInterstate 5, one of the nation’s most heavily traveled freeways, brings in excess of 92,000 vehicles per day through our land, according to data from the California Department of Transportation. Our holdings include 16 miles of Interstate 5 frontage on each side of the freeway and the commercial land surrounding three interchanges. The strategic plan for real estate focuses on development opportunities along the Interstate 5 and Highway 138 corridors, which includes TRCC; MV, a resort and residential community; Grapevine, a mixed-use master planned community in Kern County; Grapevine North, a 7,655-acre development area; and Centennial, a mixed-use master planned community in Los Angeles County. TRCC includes developments east and west of Interstate 5 at TRCC-East and TRCC-West, respectively. \n\nThe chart below is a continuum of the real estate development process highlighting each project's current status and key milestones to be met in moving through the real estate development process in California.  During this process, we may experience delays arising from factors beyond our control.  Such factors include litigation and a changing regulatory environment.\n\nNote: Grapevine North's entitlement efforts have not yet begun. The Company regularly assesses its long-term growth strategy and capital resources when determining when to start this additional development.\n\n11\n\nReporting Segments\n\nReal Estate - Commercial/Industrial\n\nA primary focus of the Company is our real estate commercial/industrial segment that includes: planning and permitting of land held for development; construction of infrastructure; the construction of pre-leased buildings; the construction of buildings to be leased or sold; and the sale of land to third parties for their own development. The real estate commercial/industrial segment also includes activities related to communications leases, a power plant lease, and landscape maintenance fees.\n\nAt the heart of our real estate commercial/industrial segment is TRCC, a 20 million square foot commercial/industrial development on Interstate 5 just north of the Los Angeles basin. The Los Angeles industrial market is the largest in the country by many measures, sitting at the center of a 2 billion square-foot Southern California industrial market. It has been characterized by some of the highest asking rents and lowest vacancy rates of any market in the nation. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the primary industrial drivers and are responsible for over 30% of all inbound containers into the U.S. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our industrial portfolio, through our joint venture partnerships, consisted of 2.8 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, and our TRCC commercial portfolio consisted of 620,907 square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2024, our industrial portfolio was 100% leased and our commercial portfolio was 96% leased. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements.  A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.\n\nOver eight million square feet of industrial, commercial, and retail space has been developed and is either operational (by us or third parties that we sold to), under construction, or soon to be under construction at TRCC, including distribution centers for IKEA, Caterpillar, Nestlé, Famous Footwear, L'Oreal, Camping World, Sunrise Brands, Dollar General and RectorSeal. TRCC sits on both sides of Interstate 5, giving distributors immediate access to the west coast’s principal north-south goods movement corridor.\n\n12\n\nTRCC has an FTZ designation, of approximately 1,094 acres, which allows a user within the FTZ to secure the many benefits and cost reductions associated with streamlined movement of goods in and out of a trade zone. TRCC's attractiveness as a commercial/industrial location is further enhanced by AdvanceKern, formerly known as the Economic Development Incentive Policy, or EDIP, adopted by the Kern County Board of Supervisors. AdvanceKern is aimed to expand and enhance the County's competitiveness by taking affirmative steps to attract new businesses and to encourage the growth and resilience of existing businesses. AdvanceKern provides incentives such as assistance in obtaining state tax incentives, building supporting infrastructure, and workforce development.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nFor a discussion of business developments that occurred in 2024, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” later in this report. Certain summarized highlights are contained below.\n\nConstruction\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we began construction of the first phase of a multi-family community, Terra Vista at Tejon, within TRCC. The development is located on a 22-acre site immediately north of the Outlets at Tejon. Terra Vista at Tejon is our first residential development. This development will also begin TRCC’s transition to a mixed-use master-planned community. TRCC already includes a large employment base of industrial and retail users totaling over 8.8 million square feet of existing development, under construction or near construction, with an additional 11.1 million square feet of entitled space to be developed in the future.\n\nInvestments\n\nLeasing\n\nWithin our commercial/industrial segment, we lease land to various types of tenants. We currently lease land to two auto service stations with convenience stores, 12 fast-food operations, one service diner-style restaurant, a motel, an antique shop, and a post office.\n\nIn addition, the Company leases several microwave repeater locations, radio and cellular transmitter sites, fiber optic cable routes, and 32 acres of land to PEF for an electric power plant.\n\n13\n\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to lease expirations for our consolidated entities as of December 31, 2024.\n\nYear of Lease ExpirationNumber of Expiring LeasesRentable Square Footage of Expiring LeasesAnnualized Base Rent1\n\nPercentage of Annual Minimum Rent\n\n2025968,518 $90212.49%\n\n2026865,367 $5427.51%\n\n202731,201 $2323.21%\n\n2028690,131 $4616.39%\n\n 20302\n\n31,394,000 $4,64564.34%\n\n203213,750 $1522.11%\n\n20331125,453 $821.14%\n\n203411,801 $761.05%\n\nThereafter264,004 $1271.76%\n\n1 Annualized base rent is calculated as monthly base rent (cash basis) per the lease, as of the reporting period, multiplied by 12.  Annualized base rent shown in thousands.\n\n2 This amount includes 32 acres of the PEF ground lease.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we had three lease renewals.\n\nTerra Vista at Tejon\n\nIn 2021, the Kern County Board of Supervisors approved a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) which authorizes the development of a multi-family apartment complex within TRCC.  The approved CUP authorizes the Company to develop up to a maximum of 495 multi-family residences, in thirteen apartment buildings, as well as approximately 6,500 square feet of community amenity space and 8,000 square feet of community serving retail, collectively known as Terra Vista at Tejon. The multi-family apartment community will be located on a 22-acre site immediately north of the Outlets at Tejon. Terra Vista at Tejon will be the first residential community at TRCC and for the Company providing an ideal housing option for the thousands of employees currently working at the various distribution centers, retailers, hotels and fast-food restaurants at TRCC. \n\nJoint Ventures\n\nWe use joint ventures to advance our development projects at TRCC.  This allows us to combine our resources with other real estate companies and gain greater access to capital, share in the risks of real estate developments and share in the operating expenses. More importantly, we believe it allows us to better manage the deployment of our capital for entitlement and litigation efforts, and increase our leasing portfolio. \n\nOur joint venture with TravelCenters of America owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities, two restaurants, 13 fast-food operations, and five separate gas stations with convenience stores within TRCC-West and TRCC-East.\n\nWe are involved in five joint ventures with Majestic Realty Co., or Majestic, to develop, lease, manage, and/or acquire industrial buildings within TRCC.  These joint ventures currently operate five fully leased industrial buildings occupying over 2.8 million rentable square feet.\n\nWe formed one new joint venture with Dedeaux Properties in the fourth quarter of 2024 to develop, lease and manage an approximately 510,385 industrial building within TRCC - East, subject to the execution of construction financing.\n\nWe are involved in a joint venture with Rockefeller Development Group, or RDG, as of December 31, 2024. The TRCC/Rock Outlet Center LLC operates the Outlets at Tejon. \n\n14\n\nTRCC Entitlements\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company's commercial, retail and industrial real estate developments as of December 31, 2024:\n\n($ in thousands)\n\nProjectCost to DateEstimated Cost to CompleteTotal Estimated Cost at Completion\n\nTejon Ranch Commerce Center$112,841 $82,277 $195,118 \n\nLess: Reimbursements from TRPFFA1\n\n98,761 33,061 131,822 \n\nTRCC Development Costs, net$14,080 $49,216 $63,296 \n\n1TRPFFA is a joint powers authority formed by Kern County and TCWD to finance public infrastructure within the Company’s Kern County developments. TRPFFA, through bond sales, will reimburse the Company for qualifying infrastructure costs at TRCC.\n\nThe following table summarizes total entitlements for TRCC as of December 31, 2024:\n\n(in square feet)IndustrialCommercial Retail\n\nTotal entitlements received19,300,941956,309\n\nTotal entitlements used8,201,864674,246\n\nEntitlements available11,099,077282,063\n\nWe believe we are well positioned for long-term value creation as we continue with our current development plans at TRCC. This is evident in the 157% increase in land prices achieved over a seven-year period starting with $3.50 per square foot in 2017.  Industrial rents have increased 236% over the same seven-year period starting at $0.25 per square foot in 2017.  Current entitlements available at TRCC can facilitate alternative uses and further increase the per-acre value.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nCommercial/industrial Real Estate Development Market Overview\n\nThe logistics operators currently located within TRCC have demonstrated success in serving all of California and the western region of the United States, and we are building on their success in our marketing efforts. We will continue to focus our marketing strategy for TRCC on the significant labor and logistical benefits of our site, the pro-business approach of Kern County, and the success of the current tenants and owners within our development.  Our strategy fits within the logistics model that many companies are using, which favors large, centralized distribution facilities which have been strategically located to maximize the balance of inbound and outbound efficiencies, rather than several decentralized smaller distribution centers. Operators located within TRCC have demonstrated success through utilization of this model.  With access to markets of over 40 million people for next-day delivery service, they are also demonstrating success with e-commerce fulfillment. \n\nWe believe that our ability to provide fully-entitled, shovel-ready land parcels to support buildings ranging from 10,000 square feet to more than two million square feet, provides us with a marketing advantage.  Our marketing efforts target industrial users in the Santa Clarita Valley of northern Los Angeles County, and the northern part of the San Fernando Valley, for whom we may be an attractive location due to the limited availability of new product and high real estate costs in these locations.  Tenants in these geographic areas are typically users of smaller facilities, but often are looking to expand operations and cannot find larger size buildings in these markets.  We are also targeting larger users in the Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, that are looking to relocate to lower their operating costs.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor new construction, specifically speculative construction in comparison to pre-lease and build to suit. The commercial/industrial real estate sales market is highly competitive, with competition throughout California.  The principal factors of competition in this industry are price, availability of labor, proximity to the port complexes of Los Angeles and Long Beach and customer base.  A potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in comparison to the warehouses and distribution centers located in the West Inland Empire. \n\nOur most direct regional competitors are in the Inland Empire, a large industrial area located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, which continues its expansion eastward beyond Riverside and San Bernardino into the Perris, Moreno Valley, and Beaumont regions of Southern California.  We also face competition within Northern Los Angeles, which is comprised of the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley along with areas north of us in the San Joaquin Valley of California.  Strong demand for large distribution facilities is driving development farther east of these counties in the search for large, entitled parcels, often increasing transportation costs and lead times for companies reliant on port access.  As development in the Inland Empire continues to move east and farther away from the ports, we believe that our strategic location—with direct access to major transportation corridors and proximity to the ports—positions us as a competitive alternative for logistics, warehousing, and distribution operations.\n\nThe Inland Empire industrial market continues to witness elevated demand in the fourth quarter of 2024, with leasing activity surpassing 10 million square feet for the third quarter in a row. However, vacancy rates climbed to 6.8%, a 170-basis point increase year-over-year. Average asking rents declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, dropping by $0.07 per square foot (5.6%) quarter-over-quarter and $0.33 per square foot (22%) from one year ago to $1.15 per square foot. The San Fernando Valley and Ventura County industrial markets continue to see somewhat tight conditions. Some vacancy was returned to the market, and the overall vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley increased by 60 basis points to 2.5% and remained unchanged at 2.2% in Ventura county, while net absorption was negative in the Valley and positive in Ventura County. Average asking rent declined in the Valley, dropping by $0.20 to $1.54 triple-net lease, or NNN, and by $0.09 in Ventura to $1.13 NNN.\n\nVacancy Rates\n\nAverage Asking Rent\n\nDecember 31, 2024December 31, 2023December 31, 2022December 31, 2024December 31, 2023December 31, 2022\n\nInland Empire6.8%5.1%0.9%1.151.481.61\n\nSan Fernando Valley and Ventura County2.4%1.5%0.7%1.421.541.46\n\nSource data from Colliers International Group\n\nIndustrial users seeking larger spaces are going further north into neighboring Kern County, and particularly TRCC, which has attracted increased attention as market conditions continue to tighten. Additionally, TRCC is in a position to capture tenant awareness due to our ability to provide a competitive alternative for users in the Inland Empire and the Santa Clarita Valley. \n\nGiven California’s regulators recent efforts at the local and state levels to tighten restrictions on industrial zoning  and specific industrial uses, we anticipate further legislative activity in this area.  The Company’s existing and planned development are designed to align with current regulatory requirements, while incorporating flexibility where possible to adapt to future policy \n\n17\n\nchanges. Through our Company advocacy strategies, Tejon Ranch will engage to influence policy discussions to support our industrial development goals.\n\nReal Estate - Resort/Residential\n\nOur resort/residential segment activities include land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering, and land stewardship and conservation activities. We have three major resort/residential communities within this segment:\n\n•Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch\n\n•Centennial at Tejon Ranch\n\n•Grapevine at Tejon Ranch\n\n•Grapevine North \n\nThe entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete.  Litigation by environmental and other special interest groups has been a primary cause of delays and increased costs for our real estate development projects as well as other projects in California. For discussion on legal matters pertaining to our developments, see Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs we embark on our mixed-use master planned communities, we expect that full build out may take 25 years or longer from the start of construction. The entitlement process for development of property in California is inherently complex, lengthy (often spanning multiple years) and costly, requiring approvals at federal, state, and county levels. We are unable to determine anticipated completion dates for our real estate development projects with certainty because the time for completion is heavily dependent on the regulatory approvals necessary for land development. \n\nBeyond regulatory factors, we remain highly aware of both micro- and macroeconomic conditions that have a significant influence on the real estate sector.  As a developer, one would be at an economic disadvantage to bring product to market with no willing or able buyers. This ebb and flow of the economy also plays into the timing of our completion date. Additionally, costs fluctuate over the life of these projects due to labor, raw material expenses, and shifting economic conditions. Inflation further compounds the uncertainty, as both cost estimates and completion dates remain subject to ongoing economic and regulatory dynamics. We have obtained entitlements on MV and prevailed in litigation in 2012, and Grapevine was reapproved unanimously by the Kern County Board of Supervisors in 2019 and prevailed in litigation in 2021.\n\n18\n\n19\n\nMountain Village at Tejon Ranch\n\nMV is planned to be an exclusive, low-density, resort-based community that will provide its owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities, lodging and spa facilities, putting greens, a range of housing options, and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish MV as the resort community of choice for the Southern California market.  MV encompasses 26,417 acres, including 5,082 acres for a mixed-use master planned community to include housing, lodging, retail, and commercial components. MV is entitled for 3,450 homes, 160,000 square feet of commercial development, 750 hotel keys, and 21,335 acres of open space. The first final map for the project consisting of 401 residential lots and parcels for hospitality, amenities, and public uses was approved by Kern County in December 2021.\n\nThe commercial component of the project is the 160,000 square foot commercial center that we call Farm Village (shown above). Farm Village will serve as the commercial center and community gathering place for MV residents and visitors, as well as the gateway to MV. Farm Village will include fresh culinary offerings, artisan markets, boutique lodging, and an array of trails, gardens, and agriculture that will be intertwined to create the most unique, relaxing and edutaining experience, while fulfilling the needs of residents and visitors of MV.  In 2018, we obtained commercial site plan approval from Kern County for the first phase of the Farm Village consisting of 53,180 square feet. \n\nTiming of MV development in the coming years will be dependent on the strength of both the economy and the residential real estate market. We are currently exploring capital financing opportunities for the development of MV.  Such financing opportunities could come from a variety of sources, such as joint ventures with financial partners, debt financing, or equity financing.\n\n20\n\nCentennial at Tejon Ranch\n\nThe Centennial development is a mixed-use master planned community development encompassing 12,323 acres of our land within Los Angeles County. Centennial is entitled for 19,333 housing units, including nearly 3,500 affordable units, and 10.1 million square feet of commercial development. Centennial will incorporate business districts, schools, retail and entertainment centers, medical facilities and other commercial offices and light industrial businesses that, when complete, will create a substantial number of jobs. The project is being developed by Centennial Founders, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 93.65% ownership interest as of December 31, 2024.  Centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly community that will achieve a job-housing balance.\n\nCentennial had entitlements approved in 2019 by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. These approvals were litigated in two lawsuits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in May 2019 and we have since worked on defending and addressing the ongoing litigation, including considering all options to address the Superior Court’s January 2022 decision and the Superior Court’s March 22, 2023 final judgment. On May 26, 2023, we filed a Notice of Appeal, thereby appealing the Superior Court’s decision to the Second District of the California Court of Appeal. On June 27, 2023, CBD/CNPS cross-appealed the Superior Court’s ruling. Briefing at the Court of Appeal is complete and the Court of Appeal has calendared an April 4, 2025 hearing date for this matter. During the appeals process the Superior Court’s order of the rescission of project approvals has been placed on hold. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n21\n\nGrapevine at Tejon Ranch\n\nGrapevine is a mixed-use master planned community encompassing 8,010 acres of our lands within Kern County located on the San Joaquin Valley floor, adjacent to TRCC.  Grapevine is entitled for 12,000 homes, 5.1 million square feet for commercial development, and more than 3,367 acres of open space and parks.  The 4,643 acres designated for mixed-use development will include housing, retail, commercial, and industrial components. See Note 13 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion.\n\nImmediately northeast of Grapevine is Grapevine North, a 7,655-acre development area, which is currently used for agricultural purposes. Identified as a development area in the RWA, Grapevine North presents a significant opportunity for future development.  Grapevine North may feature mixed-use community development similar to Grapevine at Tejon Ranch, or other development uses as appropriate based upon market conditions at the time.\n\nThe greatest competition for the Centennial and Grapevine communities will come from developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. The developments in these areas will be providing similar housing products as our developments.  The principal factors of competition in this industry are product segmentation, pricing of product, amenities offered, and location.  We will attempt to differentiate our developments through our unique setting, land planning and different product offerings. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreational and residential homes.\n\n22\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company's residential real estate developments as of December 31, 2024:\n\nCommunity:Mountain VillageCentennialGrapevineResort\n\nLocation:Kern CountyLos Angeles CountyKern CountyResidential\n\nProject Status1:\n\nEntitledEntitled 4\n\nEntitledTotal\n\nEntitlement Area (acres):26,41712,3238,01046,750\n\nHousing Units:3,45019,33312,00034,783\n\nCommercial Development (sqft)2:\n\n160,00010,100,0005,100,00015,360,000\n\nOpen Areas (acres):21,3355,6243,36730,326\n\nCosts to Date3:\n\n$158,348$124,136$42,456$324,940\n\n1 Estimated completion anticipated to be 25 years, or longer, from commencement of construction.

We continue to look for opportunities to grow our mineral resource revenues through expansion of leasing and encouraging new exploration.  The management of our water assets consists of the evaluation of near-term highest and best uses, which can include the sale of water on a temporary basis, the use of water for internal purposes, and the storage of water for future use in our development projects.  At the same time, we are also evaluating opportunities as they arise for the purchase of additional water assets as we have done in the past.\n\nRoyalty rates are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash. Our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil, natural gas, and rock and aggregate product, the inevitable decline in production of existing wells and quarries, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate on our lands, including the cost of development and production. \n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us.  We do not make such estimates, and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us.\n\nWe lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas. We do not engage in any oil exploration or extraction activities. As of December 31, 2024, 12,015 acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately 83,411 barrels of oil and 20,480 MCF (each MCF being 1,000 cubic feet) of dry gas during 2024. Our share of production, based upon average royalty rates during the last three years, has been 31, 34, and 36 barrels of oil per day for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  There are 302 active oil wells located on the leased land as of December 31, 2024. Royalty rates on our leases averaged approximately 13% of oil production in 2024. New exploration and expansion of oil production within California is discouraged by state permitting rules and regulatory actions.\n\nThe price per barrel of oil decreased in the first quarter of 2024 and peaked for the year during the second quarter of 2024. Oil and natural gas prices are highly sensitive to fluctuations driven by relatively minor shifts in supply and demand, market uncertainty and various external factors beyond our control. These include changes in domestic and global supply and demand dynamics, domestic and global inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, including ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further contribute to price volatility.\n\nWe have approximately 2,000 acres under lease to National for the purpose of manufacturing Portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage.  National owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a production capacity in excess of 1,000,000 tons of cement per year. The amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant. The term of this lease expires in 2026, however National has options to extend the lease until 2095.\n\n23\n\nWe also lease 277 acres to Granite Construction and 244 acres to Griffith Construction for the mining of rock and aggregate product that is used in construction of roads and bridges. The royalty revenues we receive under this arrangement are based upon the amount of product produced at these sites. The Granite site reached the end of its economic life and began restoration activities during 2023. We also have a royalty arrangement with Granite Construction tied to 703 acres of land previously owned by the Company that began operations in 2021 and is now paying royalty payments, which will more than offset the payments received from the old Granite site.\n\nWater sales opportunities each year are impacted by rain and snowfall volume along with California State Water Project, or SWP, allocations. The current SWP allocation is at 35% of contract amounts with an expectation that the allocation may increase. \n\nIn 2015, we entered into a water sale agreement with PEF, our current lessee under a power plant lease. PEF may purchase from us up to 3,500-acre feet of water per year through July 2030, with an option to extend the term. PEF is under no obligation to purchase water from us in any given year but is required to pay us an annual option payment equal to 30% of the maximum annual payment. The price of the water under the agreement is subject to 3% annual increases for the duration of the lease agreement. The Company's commitments to sell this water can be met through current water sources.\n\nFarming Operations\n\nIn the San Joaquin Valley, we farm permanent crops including the following acreage: wine grapes— 1,036 (all in production); almonds—2,116 (1,357 in production and 759 under development); and pistachios—935 (all in production).  We periodically lease 530 acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables which can also be used for the development of permanent crops, such as almonds. As part of our efforts to diversify our permanent crop portfolio, we are planting 160 acres of olives in 2025, with an additional 160 acres planned for 2026.\n\nPricing for nut and grape crops is particularly sensitive to the size of each year’s world crop, prior year inventory carry forward, and demand for those crops. The almond industry projected 2024 yields to be about 2.6 billion pounds, down from the previous report of over 3.0 billion pounds. This estimate along with a lower inventory carry forward has helped to improve pricing. \n\nWeather conditions can also impact the number of tree and vine dormant hours, which are integral to tree and vine growth. In addition, late spring rains negatively impacted 2024 grape production as the rains occurred during the grape bloom. The timing of the rains also increased cultural costs within grapes to fight higher levels of mildew in the vineyards. We will not know the impact of current weather conditions on 2025 production until summer of 2025. \n\nLabor costs, both internal and through labor contractors, continue to increase and the Company expects this trend to continue over the foreseeable future.  The Company utilizes external labor contractors, as necessary, for large projects, such as pruning and harvesting, as a way to manage our labor needs. From a broader inflationary standpoint, the Company is seeing and expects to continue to see an increase in production costs, most notably chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides, and fuel costs. \n\nSales of our grape crop typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year.  Sales of our pistachio and almond crops also typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year but can occur up to a year or more after each crop is harvested.  In 2024, we sold 44% of our grape crop to one winery, 33% to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers. These sales are under contracts ranging from one to eight years.  In 2024, our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers, with the largest buyer accounting for 29% of our crop. We believe that we would not be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these buyers, because of the markets for these commodities, the large number of buyers that would be available to us, and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract.\n\nAt this time, the State Department of Water Resources has announced that the estimated water supply for 2025 will be at 35% of full entitlement. This allocation may change based upon precipitation and snowpack runoff in Northern California from additional potential winter storms.  The current 35% allocation of SWP water is enough for us to farm our crops when combined with our other water sources. We have additional water resources, such as groundwater and surface sources, and those of the water districts we are in that allow us to have sufficient water for our farming needs. It is too early in the year to determine the impact of 2025 water supplies on 2025 California crop production for almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes.  See discussion of water contract entitlement and long-term outlook for water supply under Item 2, “Properties.” Also see Note 6 (Long-Term Water Assets) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our water assets. \n\nRanch Operations\n\nOur ranch operations segment consists of grazing lease revenues, game management revenues, land maintenance activities, and ancillary land uses, such as filming. \n\n24\n\nApproximately 256,000 acres are used for two grazing leases, which account for 45% of total revenues from ranch operations at December 31, 2024.\n\nGame management offers a wide variety of guided big game hunts, including trophy Rocky Mountain elk, deer, turkey and wild pig.  We offer guided hunts and memberships for both the Spring and Fall hunting seasons.  At December 31, 2024, game management accounted for 38% of the total revenue from ranch operations.   \n\nIn addition, the Ranch Operations segment manages, and includes the expenses for the upkeep, maintenance, and security, of all 270,000 acres of land.\n\nGeneral Environmental Regulation\n\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to water, air, solid waste, and hazardous substances. There can be no assurance that we will not incur costs, penalties, and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources, resulting from our operations. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties.  We also expect continued legislation and regulatory development in the area of climate change and GHG. It is unclear, as of this date, how any such developments will affect our business. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require expenditures in the future. We historically have not had material environmental liabilities.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nEnvironmental stewardship and sustainability are core values at Tejon Ranch Co., along with quality, visionary innovation and development.  This commitment to sustainability manifests itself in many ways throughout the Company and its operations.\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe Company maintains policies intended to both reduce its carbon footprint and proactively sequester, or capture and store carbon.\n\n•Since 2008, the Company has voluntarily conserved 240,000 acres of its land covered by trees and other vegetation.  An analysis conducted in 2020 for the Company by Dudek Environmental Service's determined that this acreage effectively sequesters 3.3 million tons of carbon.  That equals the volume of carbon produced in a single year by 2.5 million passenger vehicles, approximately 5% of California’s 2022 passenger vehicle fleet.\n\n•Solar power is used significantly within TRCC.  For example, the Company installed a solar-covered parking structure at the Outlets at Tejon.  The structure covers 1.85 acres and is projected to reduce by approximately 83% the center’s electricity consumption needs for shared spaces and produce approximately 1,076,000-kilowatt hour, or kWh, of clean energy every year.  In addition, the IKEA distribution center at TRCC features a 1.8 MW photovoltaic solar array covering 370,000 square feet of the warehouse’s rooftop.  The system handles the power needs of IKEA’s distribution center and provides power to the electrical grid as well.  Caterpillar’s distribution center in TRCC utilizes a ground-based solar array to reduce its energy usage.\n\n•The Company is also working with Calpine Energy, a power generating company, to complete the development of a 600-acre industrial-sized solar field.  Located immediately adjacent to Calpine’s Pastoria Energy Facility, a natural gas and steam powered generating plant in the San Joaquin Valley portion of Tejon Ranch, the solar array is expected to produce approximately 100 MW of power once fully operational.\n\n•TRCC is important to the growth of electric vehicle usage, as it contains one of the largest Tesla Supercharger stations in the country.  Combined, the west and east sides of TRCC contain nearly 100 superchargers.\n\n•The Company’s master planned mixed-use residential communities are designed with a jobs housing balance that will locate housing near employment centers, reducing commuting miles.  Centennial is designed to include electric vehicles, through vehicle purchase incentives, and the installation of 30,000 EV chargers located within both residential and commercial sections of the community, at TRCC, and within qualifying communities in Southern California.  At Centennial, at least 50% of the energy supply is intended to be produced by on-site renewable sources, and natural gas use in the community will be limited to essential commercial uses only.\n\n•At Grapevine, like Centennial, 50% or more of its energy supply is intended to be produced on site by renewable sources, and natural gas will not be installed in homes.  \n\n•All homes in MV will feature roof-top photovoltaic solar arrays and battery energy storage systems, where required by code.\n\n25\n\nAir Quality\n\n•The Company has contracted with the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, or SJVUAPCD, to pre-mitigate air emissions including GHG emissions related to the Company’s current development at TRCC-East and future development at MV and Grapevine. As part of this effort, in 2021, SJVUAPCD facilitated emissions reduction projects related to TRCC-East and identified measures to address projected future emissions for the full build-out of the project. Additionally, for the initial phase of development at Mountain Village, the Company has contributed funding to support the replacement of outdated agricultural engines, which is expected to reduce certain air emissions in the region.\n\n•Two decades ago, the Company helped establish and has continued to support Valley Clean Air Now, or ValleyCAN, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) public charity that advances quantifiable and voluntary solutions addressing air pollution in California’s San Joaquin Valley, a region with some of the worst air quality and highest poverty levels in the United States.  The Company continues to support ValleyCAN in its mission to improve public health and quality of life in disadvantaged communities located in the region.\n\nWater Conservation\n\n•At TRCC-East, water used for irrigation purposes is reclaimed water from the water treatment plant.  Landscaping at the Outlets at Tejon consists of drought-tolerant, native planting material. \n\n•Each of the Company’s master planned, mixed-use residential communities will feature state-of-the-art water conservation measures, reclaimed water for irrigation, stormwater capture, and drought-tolerant landscaping.\n\n•The Company’s agricultural operations utilize highly efficient automated and drip irrigation systems to water its orchards and vineyards. This allows for increased control and flexibility in crop irrigation as well as real-time monitoring. \n\n•We use water banks for water storage in the water basins in which we have operations which allows us to better manage our vital water resources more efficiently.\n\n•The majority of the Company’s developed land, including farming, lies within the White Wolf Groundwater Subbasin (basin ID 5-022.18), which is considered a non-critically overdrafted basin and has a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP) approved by the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nCustomers\n\nOur PEF power plant lease accounted for 11% of total revenues in 2024, 11% in 2023 and 6% in 2022. No other recurring customer represented 5% or more of our revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nOrganization\n\nTejon Ranch Co. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1987 to succeed the business operated as a California corporation since 1936.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had 82 full-time employees and six part-time employees. We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. To attract and retain top talent, we have designed our compensation and benefits programs to provide a balanced and effective reward structure. Our short and long-term incentive programs are aligned with key business objectives and are intended to motivate strong performance. Our employees are eligible for medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) savings/retirement plan, employer-provided life and disability insurance and an array of voluntary benefits designed to meet individual needs. We have adopted a Compliance with State and Federal Statutes, Rules and Regulations Reporting Policy that applies to all of our employees. Its receipt and review by each employee are documented and verified quarterly.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n26\n\nOur policies are designed to promote fairness and equal opportunities within the Company. When attracting, developing and retaining talent, we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints and embody our core values to create an inclusive culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success. We believe that an experienced and varied workforce possesses a broader array of perspectives that businesses need to remain competitive in today’s economy. We maintain employment policies that comply with federal, state and local labor laws and promote a culture of fairness and respect. These policies set forth our goal to provide equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of protected categories. All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards for appropriate behavior, and all employees must also complete required internal training on respect in the workplace to further enhance our cultural behaviors.\n\nReports\n\nWe make available, free of charge through our Internet website, www.tejonranch.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or to be furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to the SEC.  We also make available on our website our corporate governance guidelines, charters of our Board of Directors’ Committees (audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance, and real estate), and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers, and Employees. These items are also available in printed copy upon request.  We intend to disclose in the future any amendments to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers, and Employees, or waivers of such provisions granted to executive officers and directors, on the website within four business days following the date of such amendment or waiver. Any document we file with the SEC may be inspected, without charge, at the SEC’s website: http://www.sec.gov.\n\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n\nThe following table shows each of our executive officers and the offices held as of March 6, 2025, the period the offices have been held, and the age of the executive officer. \n\nNameOfficeHeld sinceAge\n\nGregory S.

      "text": "ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS\n\nThe material risks and uncertainties described below make investing in our securities risky. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our strategy, focused on more aggressive development of our land, involves significant risk and could result in operating losses. The risks that we describe in our public filings are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events, or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\n\nStrategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the macro- and micro- environment in which we operate, the demand for our products and services, the success of investments in our real estate development, technology and public policy.\n\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of future homes and commercial products live could reduce the demand for our products and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Adverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our real estate products live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business.  Adverse changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates, and population growth, or an oversupply of product for sale or lease may reduce demand, depress prices, and cause buyers to cancel their purchase agreements. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increasing insurance costs, particularly in wildfire-prone areas such as California, may make homeownership and commercial property leasing less affordable for prospective buyers and tenants. Rising premiums or limited availability of fire insurance could further suppress demand and negatively impact property values, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nHigher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry.  Higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing, which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential, commercial or industrial sites.  Higher interest rates can also lead to tighter construction lending markets impacting the development of industrial buildings within our projects. Any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments. Lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand. Any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development, which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing.\n\n28\n\nWe are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals and permits for our developments that could be denied.  In planning and developing our land, we are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, and construction.  All of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations, so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied.  In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area, which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project. Many states, cities and counties (including neighboring Ventura County) have in the past approved various “slow growth” or “urban limit line” measures.  If that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the Company’s land use, our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected.\n\nThird-party litigation increases the time and cost of our development efforts.  The land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex.  Moreover, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals, and we have repeatedly experienced such legal challenges related to our real estate development projects. As a result, the prospect and realization of third-party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements.  Third-party challenges in the form of litigation have resulted in denial of the right to develop, and, by their nature, adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals, and may do so again in the future. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation have increased and may again increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project.\n\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely. Environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location and condition, present and former uses of the site, and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species. Federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations, including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects’ carbon footprint and GHG emissions. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur additional costs for compliance, mitigation and processing land use applications, or preclude development in specific areas. In addition, in California, third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project, which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project. Certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously, so litigation challenging their approval is expected and has, in the past, occurred. Currently, the Centennial entitlement approval has been opposed through litigation against the Company and Los Angeles County.  The issues most commonly cited in opponents’ public comments include the poor air quality of the San Joaquin Valley air basin, potential impacts of projects on the California condor and other species of concern, the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors, potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in Los Angeles County, GHG emissions, water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being “sprawl.”  In addition, California has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce GHG emissions in the state and any efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects’ carbon footprint in the future.\n\nUntil final permits are received, litigation is complete, and final maps are received, we will have a limited inventory of real estate. Each of our four current and planned real estate projects, TRCC, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine involve obtaining various governmental agency permits, local government permits, such as building permits, overcoming litigation, and receiving final maps from local jurisdictions. A delay in achieving these items could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users.\n\nWe are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents. Within our real estate activities, we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in Northern, Central, and Southern California. We are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using Interstate 5 and State Route 99 for commercial leasing opportunities. Once they receive all necessary permits and approvals, Centennial and Grapevine will ultimately compete with other residential housing options in the region, such as developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield.  MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes, so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects. Intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations.\n\nIncreases in taxes or government fees could increase our cost, and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce demand for homes in our future residential communities. Increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, any changes to federal or state income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax \n\n29\n\ndeductions or incentives to homeowners, such as a change limiting the deductibility of real estate taxes or interest on home mortgages, could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce future sales.\n\nOur developable land is concentrated entirely in California. All of our developable land is in California and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within California. Any adverse change in the economic climate of California, or our regions of that state, and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of California, or the counties where our land is located, could adversely affect our real estate development activities.  Ultimately, our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations.\n\nRisks and challenges we have faced and may continue to face in land development. We have in the past and may in the future encounter other difficulties in developing our land, including:\n\n•Difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments;\n\n•Natural risks, such as geological and soil problems, earthquakes, fire, heavy rains and flooding, and heavy winds;\n\n•Shortages of qualified trades people;\n\n•Reliance on local contractors, who may be inadequately capitalized or have limited availability;\n\n•Shortages of materials; and\n\n•Increases in the cost of materials, including as a result of tariffs or a trade war.\n\nA prolonged downturn in the real estate market or instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry could have an adverse effect on our real estate business. Our residential housing projects, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine, are currently in the litigation phase, permitting phase, or are fully entitled and waiting for development to begin. If a downturn in the real estate market or an instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases, our resort/residential business could be adversely affected. An excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available. The inability of potential commercial/industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development.\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nOperational risk relates to risks arising from external market factors that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes weather and other natural conditions; regulatory requirements; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human resources and reputation.\n\nWe are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions. The real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, including:\n\n•Employment levels\n\n•Availability of financing and insurance\n\n•Interest rates\n\n•Consumer confidence\n\n•Demand for the developed product, whether residential or commercial\n\n•Supply of similar product, whether residential or commercial\n\n•Climate and weather conditions\n\nThe process of a project's development begins, and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market, which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed. It is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected. Farming and mineral resources are also subject to business cycles and/or seasonality that could have a material impact to the business.\n\nThe inability of a tenant to pay us rent adversely affects our business. Our commercial revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our tenants fail to make rental payments under \n\n30\n\ntheir leases, or negotiate lower rates or extended payment terms, our financial condition and cash flows have been and could again be adversely affected.\n\nOur inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business. Some of our revenues are derived from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if our tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could generate less cash flow from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.\n\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those costs on to tenants.  Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses, including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. We cannot be certain that our tenants will be able to bear the full burden of costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other expenses that we pass along through our leases, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the markets in which we operate may hinder or limit our ability to increase our rents. If operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability would diminish.\n\nFrom time to time, we experience shortages or increased costs of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control that cause delays or increased costs within our commercial development, which can adversely affect our operating results. Our ability to develop our current industrial development has in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control, including: work stoppages, labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people; changes in laws relating to union organizing activity; and shortages, delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of building materials (including as a result of inflation or tariffs). Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing infrastructure and buildings within our industrial development. If any of the above happens, our operating results could be harmed.\n\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects. Our future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to pursue land development. Our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel.\n\nVolatile oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.  Our cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and natural gas prices, which are volatile.  Oil and natural gas prices also impact the amount we receive for our mineral leases.  Moreover, oil and natural gas prices depend on factors we cannot control, such as: changes in foreign and domestic supply and demand for oil and natural gas; weather; political conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibilities of insurgency or war in such areas; prices of foreign exports; domestic and international drilling activity and related policies; price and availability of alternate fuel sources; the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies; the level and effect of trading in commodity markets; and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental regulations.  Substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas, future natural gas, or crude oil price could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur reserves and production will decline from their current levels.  The rate of production from oil, natural gas, and mining properties generally decline as reserves are produced.  Any decline in production or reserves could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\n\nWater delivery and water availability continues to be a long-term concern within California. Any limitation of delivery of SWP water, limitations on our ability to move our water resources, and the absence of available, reliable alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards and possibly impact future development opportunities. \n\nOur future revenue and profitability related to our water resources will primarily be dependent on our ability to acquire and sell water assets. In light of the fact that our water resources represent a portion of our overall business at present, our long-term profitability will be affected by various factors, including the availability and timing of water resource acquisitions, regulatory approvals and permits associated with such acquisitions, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties, which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resources. \n\n31\n\nMoreover, our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic and technological factors, as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets.  The factors described above are not within our control.\n\nNatural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, global conflicts, including trade wars, and other potentially catastrophic events may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. Natural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, particularly those that may cause a decline in global economic activity, could have a material adverse impact on our business, our operating results, and the market price of our common stock. Catastrophic events occurring in California, the United States, or globally may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for, and the value of, our properties. To the extent that catastrophic events impact our tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations. Disruptions to the global economy can also impact demand for, and the prices of our products, which could adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations.\n\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.  We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records.  These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. A material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of customer, employee or Company data. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future. However, we cannot provide assurance that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems failure will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. \n\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to our security and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data.  We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats despite our attempts to mitigate these risks. We also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, may nonetheless leave us vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Additionally, violations of privacy or cybersecurity laws (including the California Consumer Privacy Act), regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action and other types of litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Therefore, any such security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations. Inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations. The farming operations are most affected by escalating costs, unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our farmlands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.\n\nInflation can adversely impact our real estate operations, by increasing costs of material and labor, as well as the cost of capital, which can impact operating margins. In an inflationary environment, we may not be able to increase prices at the same pace as the increase in inflation, which would further erode operating margins.\n\nGovernment policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.  Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations.  Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, trade \n\n32\n\ntariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on commodities and commodity products, can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions affecting our industry may adversely affect the supply of, demand for and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business and cause our financial results to suffer.\n\nOur efforts, goals and disclosures related to environmental stewardship and sustainability matters expose us to risks that can adversely affect our reputation and performance. Our commitment to sustainability with respect to climate change, air quality, and water conservation reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve our goals. Such plans and aspirations may also fail to satisfy all of our stakeholders, as they reflect a variety of views that may support or disagree with these initiatives. Our pursuit of, or our failure or perceived failure to achieve, these goals and objectives on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, stock price, operations, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, as well as enforcement authorities.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS\n\nFinancial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including volatility in interest rates and commodity prices; credit risk; and liquidity risk, including risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations. We face credit risk in our commercial businesses, as well as in our investing and leasing activities and derivative financial instruments activities.  Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise and could potentially impact an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness.\n\nConstriction of the credit markets or other adverse changes in capital market conditions could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital. During past economic downturns, we relied principally on positive operating cash flow, cash and investments, our revolving credit facility and equity offerings to meet current working capital needs, entitlement investment, and investment within our developments. Any slowdown in the local, national, or global economy could negatively impact our access to credit markets and may limit our sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital.\n\nWe regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may issue new equity securities through the public capital markets, enter new joint ventures, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. Adverse changes in economic, or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results.  \n\nOur business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully (1) attract desirable strategic partners; (2) complete agreements with strategic partners; and/or (3) manage relationships with strategic partners going forward, any of which could adversely affect our business.  A key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships. These joint venture partners bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets.\n\nA complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business. These competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates. If we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nInability to comply with credit facility covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our credit facility will depend, in part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve, and the level of commodity prices related to our farming and mineral resource activities. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the addition of debt, the sale of equity, refinancing existing debt, or the sale of assets.\n\n33\n\nOur revolving credit facility requires compliance with three financial covenants: (a) total liabilities divided by tangible net worth not greater than 0.55 to 1.00 at each year end; (b) a debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.50 to 1.00 as of each year end on a rolling four quarter basis; and (c) a liquidity ratio not less than 2.00 to 1.00 at each year end. A failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility and/or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. \n\nMARKET RISKS\n\nMarket risk relates to the functioning of the New York Stock Exchange. Many factors affect market function: investor anticipation, shocks in other markets, and anything that limits the efficient functioning of the marketplace. Market risks can affect the price of our Common Stock.\n\nOnly a limited market exists for our Common Stock, which could lead to price volatility. The limited trading market for our Common Stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our Common Stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our Common Stock.\n\nConcentrated ownership of our Common Stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price. As of March 6, 2025, directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately 21.6% of our Common Stock. Investors who purchase our Common Stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our Common Stock. The sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder’s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the registration and sale of any significant number of additional shares of our Common Stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our Common Stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or fluctuate significantly.",
