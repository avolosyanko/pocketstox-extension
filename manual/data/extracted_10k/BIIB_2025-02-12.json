The EC has asked the CHMP to consider information on the safety of lecanemab that became available after the adoption of the CHMP opinion in November 2024 and whether this may require an update of the opinion, and to consider whether the wording of the risk minimization measures in the opinion is clear enough to ensure correct implementation. These will be discussed at the CHMP meeting in February 2025.\n\n•In December 2024 LEQEMBI was approved by the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk in Mexico.\n\n•In November 2024 we and Eisai announced the launch of LEQEMBI in South Korea, which had been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea in May 2024.\n\n•In October 2024 the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia issued a public statement about the initial decision not to register lecanemab. In December 2024 Eisai submitted a request for reconsideration of this decision.\n\n•In August 2024 LEQEMBI was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in Great Britain and by the Ministry of Health and Prevention in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n•In July 2024 LEQEMBI was approved in Hong Kong and Israel.\n\n•In June 2024 we and Eisai announced the launch of LEQEMBI in China, which had been approved by the NMPA in China in January 2024.\n\nUCB COLLABORATION\n\nIn September 2024 we and UCB announced positive topline data from the Phase 3 PHOENYCS GO study of dapirolizumab pegol, a novel Fc-free anti-CD40L drug candidate, in people living with moderate-to-severe SLE. The Phase 3 study met the primary endpoint demonstrating clinical improvement in moderate-to-severe SLE with clinical improvements observed among key secondary endpoints. Based on these results, UCB and Biogen initiated a second Phase 3 study in late 2024.\n\nMANAGEMENT CHANGES\n\n•In October 2024 we announced that Michael R. McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, plans to retire from Biogen on March 1, 2025. Upon Mr. McDonnell's retirement, Robin C. Kramer, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at Biogen, will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n•In January 2025 we announced the appointment of Sean Godbout as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Global Corporate Controller, effective March 1, 2025, upon the transition of Robin C. Kramer, currently Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer at Biogen, to the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS UPDATE\n\n•Effective October 1, 2024, Lloyd B.

The data presented additional measures resulting from the three years of continuous LEQEMBI treatment, showing that 46% of patients improved or had no decline and 33% showed improvement from baseline on the CDR-SB. On the ADAS-Cog14 measurement scale, 46% of patients showed improvement or no decline and 43% showed improvement. On the ADCS MCI-ADL measurement scale, 51% of patients showed improvement or no decline and 48% showed improvement.\n\n•In July 2024 Eisai announced the results of a detailed analysis of the Phase 3 CLARITY Alzheimer's disease study of LEQEMBI at the 2024 AAIC conference. The study provided further Phase 3 analysis showing three years of continuous LEQEMBI treatment reduced clinical decline by -0.95 on CDR-SB showing continued clinically and personally meaningful benefit for early Alzheimer's disease patients.\n\n3\n\n\nIMMUNOLOGY\n\nfelzartamab\n\n•Felzartamab was granted ODD in the E.U. in IgAN and solid organ transplantation in November 2024 and December 2024, respectively.\n\n•In October 2024 we presented complete results from the Phase 2 IGNAZ study evaluating felzartamab, an investigational anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, in people living with IgAN during the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2024. The results from the study showed substantial reductions in proteinuria, stabilization of kidney function and sustained treatment effect more than 18 months after the last dose of felzartamab.\n\n•In October 2024 the FDA granted felzartamab Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of late AMR without T-cell mediated rejection in kidney transplant patients.\n\nRARE DISEASE\n\nSPINRAZA (nusinersen)\n\n•In January 2025 the FDA accepted the supplemental NDA and the EMA validated the application for a higher dose regimen of nusinersen for SMA. The higher dose regimen of nusinersen comprises a more rapid loading regimen, two 50 mg-doses 14 days apart, and higher maintenance regimen, 28 mg, every four months, compared to the currently approved dose of SPINRAZA.\n\n•In September 2024 we announced positive topline data from the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study of nusinersen, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a higher dose regimen of nusinersen in treatment-naive symptomatic infants with SMA.\n\n•In March 2024 we announced new data from the Phase 4 RESPOND study for SPINRAZA. The study showed that neurofilament levels, an indicator of neurodegeneration, were reduced in nearly all study participants treated with SPINRAZA. The reductions in biomarker complement previously reported RESPOND study efficacy results showing improved motor function in most participants treated with SPINRAZA after gene therapy.\n\nSKYCLARYS\n\n•In September 2024 SKYCLARYS was approved by SWISSMEDIC for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older.\n\n•In July 2024 the first pediatric patient was treated in the Phase 1 study of SKYCLARYS designed to identify the appropriate dose for the pediatric population living with FA.\n\nQALSODY\n\n•In December 2024 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved QALSODY in Japan.\n\n•In October 2024 QALSODY was approved in China by the NMPA under the conditional approval pathway for the treatment of adults with ALS associated with a mutation in the SOD1 gene.\n\n•In May 2024 the EC approved QALSODY in the E.U. for the treatment of adults with ALS associated with a mutation in the SOD1 gene. QALSODY is the first treatment approved in the E.U. to target a genetic cause of ALS.\n\nDISCONTINUED PROGRAMS AND STUDIES\n\nSAGE COLLABORATION\n\nzuranolone\n\nIn October 2024 we and Sage agreed to not pursue further development of zuranolone for the potential treatment of MDD. This decision was based on the significant new investment and time we expect would be needed to conduct the additional studies required to support approval of this indication.\n\n4\n\n\nBIIB124\n\nIn July 2024 we and Sage announced that the Phase 2 KINETIC 2 dose-range study of BIIB124 did not meet its endpoints. Based on these results, we discontinued our further development of BIIB124 and terminated our rights under the collaboration and license agreement specific to BIIB124, effective February 17, 2025.\n\nSAMSUNG BIOEPIS 2019 DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT \n\nIn October 2024 we notified Samsung Bioepis of our decision to terminate our 2019 Development and Commercialization Agreement (the DCA Agreement) solely within the U.S. and Canada. Biogen will transfer commercialization rights for BYOOVIZ and OPUVIZ in the U.S. and Canada back to Samsung Bioepis over a period of up to 18 months. During this transition period, we will continue to commercialize BYOOVIZ. The termination does not impact the other markets in the DCA Agreement.\n\nIONIS COLLABORATION\n\nBIIB105\n\nIn May 2024 we and Ionis announced that the Phase 1/2 ALSpire study of BIIB105, an investigational ASO for the potential treatment of ALS, did not meet its endpoints. Based on these results, we discontinued our further development of BIIB105.\n\nBIIB121\n\nIn May 2024 we announced that we have elected not to exercise our option to license and lead development of BIIB121, an ASO for the potential treatment of Angelman syndrome.\n\nMERZ THERAPEUTICS (PREVIOUSLY ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.)\n\nIn January 2024 we notified Acorda of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement, effective January 1, 2025, whereby Acorda regained global commercialization rights to FAMPYRA. On April 1, 2024, Acorda filed for bankruptcy protection and announced its intention to sell substantially all of Acorda's assets to a third party. On July 10, 2024, Merz Therapeutics announced that its subsidiary Merz Pharmaceuticals LLC had completed the acquisition of FAMPYRA, and related assets from Acorda. We are now working with Merz Therapeutics on the transition of global commercialization rights of FAMPYRA and we expect to recognize minimal revenue in 2025.\n\nBIIB143 (cemdomespib)\n\nIn early 2025 we discontinued further development of BIIB143 (cemdomespib) for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, as part of our ongoing pipeline prioritization efforts.\n\n5\n\n\nMARKETED PRODUCTS\n\nThe following graph shows our product revenue, revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs and Alzheimer's collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n(1) MS includes TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA.\n\n(2) Rare disease includes SPINRAZA, QALSODY, which became commercially available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023 and commercially available in the E.U. during the second quarter of 2024, and SKYCLARYS, which was obtained as part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023.

Risk Factors included in this report. \n\nNEUROLOGY\n\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\n\nWe develop, manufacture and market a number of products designed to treat patients with MS. MS is a progressive disease in which the body loses the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death. Patients with active RMS experience an uneven pattern of disease progression characterized by periods of stability that are interrupted by flare-ups of the disease after which the patient may return to a lower baseline of functioning.\n\nThe MS products we market and our major markets are as follows:\n\nProductIndicationCollaboratorMajor Markets\n\nRMSRRMS in the E.U.Crohn's disease in the U.S.NoneU.S.BrazilFranceGermanyItalyU.K.\n\nRMS in the U.S.RRMS in the E.U.NoneU.S.FranceGermanyItalyJapanU.K.\n\nRMS in the U.S.RRMS in the E.U.Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of AlkermesU.S.FranceGermanyNetherlandsSpainSwitzerland\n\nRMSNoneU.S.CanadaFranceGermanyItalySpain\n\nRMS in the U.S.RRMS in the E.U.NoneU.S.FranceGermanyItalySpainU.K.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Alkermes, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n7\n\n\nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n\nAlzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurological illness that causes a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, usually during a span of seven to ten years. Nearly all brain functions, including memory, movement, language, judgement, behavior and abstract thinking, are eventually affected. In the U.S., Alzheimer's disease is the seventh-leading cause of death, accounting for over 120,000 deaths each year.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is characterized by two abnormalities in the brain: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques, which are found in the tissue between the nerve cells, are unusual clumps of a protein called beta amyloid along with degenerating bits of neurons and other cells. Neurofibrillary tangles are bundles of twisted filaments found within neurons. These tangles are largely made up of a protein called tau.\n\nOur Alzheimer's disease products and major markets are as follows:\n\nProductIndicationCollaboratorMajor Market\n\nAlzheimer's diseaseEisaiU.S.ChinaGreat BritainIsraelJapanSouth KoreaUnited Arab Emirates\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nNEUROPSYCHIATRY\n\nNeuropsychiatry includes ZURZUVAE for PPD, which became commercially available in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023. PPD symptoms are estimated to affect approximately one in eight women who have given birth in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mental health conditions are the leading cause of maternal mortality with PPD among the most common complications during and after pregnancy.\n\nProductIndicationCollaboratorMajor Markets\n\nPPD in adultsSageU.S.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Sage, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nRARE DISEASE\n\nRare disease includes SPINRAZA for SMA, QALSODY for ALS, which became commercially available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023 and commercially available in the E.U. during the second quarter of 2024, and SKYCLARYS for FA, which was obtained as part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023. SKYCLARYS became commercially available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023 and we began recognizing revenue from SKYCLARYS in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023, subsequent to our acquisition. SKYCLARYS was approved and became commercially available in the E.U. during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nSMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a deletion or mutations in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough SMN protein, which is critical to the survival of the neurons that control muscles. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support, and typically do not live beyond two years of age without respiratory support and nutritional interventions. People with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA.\n\n8\n\n\nFA is an inherited, debilitating and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is typically diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death. Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation, wheelchair reliance and eventually death.\n\nALS is a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord that are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. People with ALS experience muscle weakness and atrophy, causing them to lose independence as they steadily lose the ability to move, speak, eat and eventually breathe. Average life expectancy for people with ALS is three to five years from time of symptom onset. Multiple genes have been implicated in ALS. Genetic testing helps determine if a person's ALS is associated with a genetic mutation, even in individuals without a known family history of the disease. SOD1-ALS is a mutation in the SOD1 gene, and this form of ALS is diagnosed in approximately two percent of all ALS cases.\n\nOur Rare disease products and major markets are as follows: \n\nProductIndicationCollaboratorMajor Markets\n\nSMAIonisU.S.BrazilFranceGermanyItalyTurkey\n\nFA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and olderNoneU.S.FranceGermany\n\nALS in adults with mutation in SOD1 geneIonisU.S.Germany\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n9\n\n\nBIOSIMILARS\n\nBiosimilars are a group of biologic medicines that are highly similar to currently available biologic therapies developed by companies known as \"originators\".

We focus on health care provider sales and marketing efforts on providers in both private practice and at major medical centers.\n\nDISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe distribute our products in the U.S. principally through wholesale and specialty distributors of pharmaceutical products and specialty pharmacies, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, the distribution of our products varies from country to country, including through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and third-party distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS, LUNSUMIO and COLUMVI are distributed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\n\nWe distribute BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe and have an option to acquire exclusive rights to distribute these products in China. We also distribute BYOOVIZ in certain international markets and TOFIDENCE in the U.S.\n\nOur product sales to two wholesale distributors each accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 39.3%, 36.9% and 37.9%, respectively, of our gross product revenue. For additional information, please read Note 5, Revenue, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nPATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS\n\nPatents are important for obtaining and protecting exclusive rights in our products and product candidates. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan and in selected other countries for inventions originating from our research and development efforts and those we license or acquire. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications. \n\nU.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed; however, U.S. patents on applications filed before June 8, 1995, may be effective until \n\n12\n\n\n17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20-year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., additional patent term may be awarded due to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office delays in prosecuting the application. In the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents vary, in accordance with local law. For example, in a number of European countries, SPCs can be granted to a product to compensate in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nRegulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, can also provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it created at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the period of exclusive use, third parties are permitted to reference such data in abbreviated applications for approval and to market (subject to any applicable market protection) their generic drugs and biosimilars. Market protection provides the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a period of time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another product containing the same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country.\n\nWe also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through refraining from public disclosure and utilizing confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment are our exclusive property.\n\nOur trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.\n\nOUR PATENT PORTFOLIO \n\nThe following table describes certain patents in the U.S. and Europe that we currently consider of primary importance to our marketed products, including the territory, patent number, general subject matter and expected expiration dates. Except as otherwise noted, the expected expiration dates include any granted patent term extensions and issued SPCs. In some instances, there may be additional later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to, among other things, particular forms or compositions, methods of manufacturing or use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. We also continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.\n\n13\n\n\nProductTerritoryPatent No.General Subject MatterPatent \n\nExpiration(1)\n\nTECFIDERAEurope2,653,873Methods of

Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing products, compounds and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We also face challenges to our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights covering our products by third-parties, such as manufacturers of generics, biosimilars, prodrugs and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and the discussion of legal proceedings related to certain patents described above is set forth in Note 21, Litigation, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n16\n\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nCompetition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.\n\nWe believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on scientific, managerial and technological excellence and innovation, as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the regulatory and commercial expertise to effectively advance and market our products.\n\nCompetition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position.\n\nThe introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. Similarly, developments of new standards of care practices, treatment options or cures for the diseases our products treat could have similar impacts.\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below and in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\n\nGENERIC AND BIOSIMILARS COMPETITION\n\nCertain of our products already face, or may face in the future, competition from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. In some jurisdictions a decrease in reimbursed price is mandated by law. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\n\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrants are now in North America, Brazil and certain European countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. We are defending the validity of our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA and expiring in 2028 in opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office. We are also engaged in litigation in Europe to defend and enforce national counterparts of our EP 2 653 873 patent, with mixed results. The generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline.\n\nBiosimilar products referencing RITUXAN have launched in the U.S and are being offered at lower prices. This competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, as the sales of RITUXAN have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. We expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years. \n\n17\n\n\nA biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI was approved in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2023. We expect that future sales of TYSABRI may be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar.\n\nNEUROLOGY\n\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\n\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One competing product that was approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. Another competing product that was approved in the U.S. in 2020 and the E.U. in 2021 is KESIMPTA, a treatment for RMS that was developed by Novartis AG. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected if OCREVUS and KESIMPTA continue to gain market share, or if other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized.\n\nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n\nThe market for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is undeveloped and could be subject to rapid change in the future. Most current treatments are symptomatic or intended to improve quality of life. Along with us, several companies are working to develop additional treatments. We and our collaboration partner Eisai co-commercialize LEQEMBI, an anti-amyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In 2024 a competing product, KISUNLA, a treatment for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease that was developed by Eli Lilly and Company, was approved in the U.S. We are aware of other products now in development that, if approved, may also compete with LEQEMBI.\n\nRARE DISEASE\n\nSPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY\n\nWe face competition from a gene therapy product ZOLGENSMA (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) and an oral product EVRYSDI (risdiplam). We expect that we will experience competition from both products in additional jurisdictions in the future, as well as from the launch of new formulations of those products, which may adversely affect our sales of SPINRAZA.\n\n18\n\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nA commitment to research and development is fundamental to our mission. Our research efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying biology of diseases so we can discover and deliver treatments that have the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our capabilities in small molecule, antisense, gene therapy and other technologies, we target specific medical needs where we believe new or better treatments are needed.\n\nWe intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels.\n\nFor additional information on our research and development expense included in our consolidated statements of income, please read Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.\n\nThe table below highlights our current research and development programs that are in clinical trials and the current phase of such programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in Item 1A.

If marketing approval is obtained, both companies will jointly commercialize dapirolizumab pegol and share profits and losses equally.\n\n20\n\n\nDENALI\n\nWe have a collaboration and license agreement with Denali to co-develop and co-commercialize Denali's small molecule inhibitors of LRRK2 for Parkinson's disease. Under the LRRK2 Collaboration, both companies share responsibility and costs for global development based on specified percentages as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. and China. Outside the U.S. and China we are responsible for commercialization and may pay Denali potential tiered royalties.\n\nSAMSUNG BIOEPIS\n\nWe have an agreement with Samsung Bioepis to commercialize three anti-TNF biosimilar product candidates in certain countries in Europe. Under this agreement, we are commercializing BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE.\n\nWe have also secured the exclusive rights to commercialize BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in certain international markets, and OPUVIZ, an aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA, which was approved in the E.U. during the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition to our commercialization agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we license certain of our proprietary technology to Samsung Bioepis in connection with Samsung Bioepis' development, manufacture and commercialization of its biosimilar products.\n\nREGULATORY\n\nOur current and contemplated activities and the products, technologies and processes that result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulation.\n\nREGULATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS\n\nPRODUCT APPROVAL AND POST-APPROVAL REGULATION IN THE U.S.\n\nAPPROVAL PROCESS\n\nBefore new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or a NDA. In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.\n\nProduct development and receipt of regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of suitable alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delays or expenses. Furthermore, even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existing pre-clinical and/or clinical data. \n\nThe FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory review of therapeutically important drugs, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review.\n\n•Accelerated Approval: The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to provide the FDA with confirmatory data post-approval to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA \n\n21\n\n\nconcludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least 30 days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n\n•Fast Track: The FDA may grant \"fast track\" status to products that treat a serious condition and have data demonstrating the potential to address an unmet medical need or a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product.\n\n•Breakthrough Therapy: The FDA may grant “breakthrough therapy” status to drugs designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence suggests a substantial improvement over existing therapies based on a clinically significant endpoint. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the time to product approval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be eligible for priority review and does not ensure FDA approval.\n\n•Priority Review: “Priority review” only applies to applications (original or efficacy supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review may also be granted for any supplement that proposes a labeling change due to studies completed in response to a written request from the FDA for pediatric studies, for an application for a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product or for any application or supplement for a drug submitted with a PRV.\n\nAs part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we obtained a rare pediatric disease PRV in connection with the approval of SKYCLARYS, which was approved by the FDA in February 2023.\n\nPOST-MARKETING STUDIES\n\nRegardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the FDA may withdraw its approval. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as REMS. The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation.\n\nADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n\nWe monitor information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report such information and events to regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials) or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals.\n\nAPPROVAL OF CHANGES TO AN APPROVED PRODUCT\n\nIf we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than what was initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.\n\n22\n\n\nREGULATION OF PRODUCT ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION\n\nThe FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. Pursuant to FDA guidance, a company can make safety and efficacy claims either in or consistent with the product label. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Such off-label prescribing is common across medical specialties, and often reflects a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the government. \n\nREGULATION OF COMBINATION PRODUCTS\n\nCombination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. Some of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and similar regulations outside the U.S., and we expect that some of our pipeline product candidates may be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. \n\nIn May 2017 new regulations governing medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices entered into force in the E.U. The medical devices regulations became applicable in May 2021 and the in-vitro diagnostic medical devices regulations became applicable in May 2022. All products covered by these regulations will be required to comply with them at the end of the transitional periods. These regulations introduce new requirements, including for clinical investigation of certain classifications of medical devices, require increased regulatory scrutiny, enhance the requirements for post market surveillance and vigilance and provide for greater transparency. These regulations also change the requirements for assessment of the medical device components of integral drug-device combination products, necessitating assessment of the device components under both the medical device and medicinal product regulatory regimes.\n\nPRODUCT APPROVAL AND POST-APPROVAL REGULATION OUTSIDE THE U.S.\n\nWe market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, for example, where a substantial part of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several routes for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The MAA is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA responsible for human medicines. If the CHMP determines that the MAA fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy and that the medicine has a positive benefit risk balance, it will adopt a positive opinion recommending the granting of the marketing authorization by the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A MAA approved by the EC is valid in all member states of the E.U. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.\n\nIn addition to the centralized procedure, the European regulatory framework includes the following options for regulatory review and approval in the E.U. member states: \n\n•a national procedure, where the first application is made to the competent authority in one E.U. member state only; \n\n•a decentralized procedure, where applicants submit identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous approval, if the medicine has not yet been authorized in any E.U. member state; and \n\n•a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants that have a medicine authorized in one E.U. member state can apply for mutual recognition of this authorization in other E.U. member states.\n\nAs in the U.S., the E.U. also has distinct approaches intended to optimize the regulatory pathways for therapeutically important drugs, including the Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme, accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization. Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme is intended to provide additional support to medicine developers throughout the development process. Regulatory review timelines in the E.U. may be truncated under accelerated assessment for products that address an unmet medical need. In addition, conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for products in the interest of public health, where the benefit of immediate availability \n\n23\n\n\noutweighs the risk of having less comprehensive data than normally required. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The marketing authorization holder is required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies and, in some cases, additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the marketing authorization may be converted into a standard marketing authorization.\n\nAside from the U.S. and the E.U., there are countries in other regions where it is possible to receive an \"accelerated\" review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.\n\nIn the E.U. there is detailed legislation on pharmacovigilance and extensive guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices. A failure to comply with the E.U. pharmacovigilance obligations may result in significant financial penalties for the marketing authorization holder.\n\nRegardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. The EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines and makes recommendations on product safety issues. Marketing authorization holders have an obligation to inform regulatory agencies of any new information which may influence the evaluation of benefits and risks of the medicinal product concerned. \n\nIn the U.S., the E.U. and other jurisdictions, regulatory agencies, including the FDA, conduct periodic inspections of NDA, BLA and marketing authorization holders to assess their compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations.\n\nGOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES\n\nRegulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current GMP and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations.\n\nGOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES\n\nThe FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current GCP). Regulatory agencies enforce current GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, CROs and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable current GCP guidelines, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with current GCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.\n\nIn April 2014 the EC adopted a new Clinical Trial Regulation, which was entered into force in June 2014 but did not apply until January 2022. There are transitional provisions for clinical trials which are ongoing at the date of application. Clinical trial applications could be made under the Clinical Trial Directive (the existing regulatory framework) through January 2023. All clinical trials must fully comply with the Clinical Trial Regulation by January 2025. The regulation harmonizes the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the E.U. and will require that information on the authorization, conduct and results of each clinical trial conducted in the E.U. be publicly available.\n\nAPPROVAL OF BIOSIMILARS \n\nIn the U.S. the PPACA amended the PHS Act to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, referred to as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be \"highly similar\" to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The biosimilar must show it has no clinically meaningful \n\n24\n\n\ndifferences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product, and only minor differences in clinically inactive components are allowable in biosimilar products. The approval pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. There is uncertainty, however, as the approval framework for biosimilars originally was enacted as part of the PPACA. There have been, and there are likely to continue to be, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. If the PPACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.\n\nA biosimilars approval pathway has been in place in the E.U. since 2003. The EMA has issued a number of scientific and product specific biosimilar guidelines, including requirements for approving biosimilars containing monoclonal antibodies. In the E.U., biosimilars are generally approved under the centralized procedure. The approval pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on reliance on the clinical trial data of an innovator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated, through comprehensive comparability studies, to be “similar.” In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full complement of clinical trials typically required for novel biologic drugs.\n\nORPHAN DRUG ACT\n\nUnder the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant ODD to drugs or biologics intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an ODD subsequently receives an initial FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the E.U., medicinal products that receive and maintain an orphan designation are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity following approval, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization. SPINRAZA has been granted ODD in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan; QALSODY and SKYCLARYS have been granted ODD in the U.S. and the E.U.; and felzartamab has been granted ODD in the U.S. for development in the treatment of PMN and AMR and in the E.U. in IgAN and solid organ transplantation.\n\nREGULATION PERTAINING TO PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT\n\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments, private health plans and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the pricing and reimbursement of our products, and drug prices continue to receive significant scrutiny. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. Challenges to our pricing strategies, by either government or private stakeholders, could harm our business. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted and regularly consider additional reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities and private health insurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, may impose restrictions on access, coverage or pricing of particular drugs based on perceived value.\n\nWITHIN THE U.S.\n\n•Medicaid: Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate is established by law and is adjusted upward if the AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\n25\n\n\n•Medicare: Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners, are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price of the drugs. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide average sales price information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of average sales price, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\nMedicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government. Each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and pharmacies, and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. In addition, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to the CMS a discount of up to 70.0% on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which provides for (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D drugs (beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (beginning in 2028), (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, and (iii) Medicare Part D redesign which replaces the current coverage gap provisions and establishes a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for up to 10.0% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and up to 20.0% after that cap is reached. \n\nThe result of these forthcoming changes for manufacturers, including us, may include: i) a material adverse effect on our revenue on drugs subject to “negotiation”; ii) new rebate liability for drugs subject to the inflation provisions, and iii) potential significant additional costs related to the Part D re-design.\n\n•Federal Agency Discounted Pricing: Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the FSS. FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the VA, Department of Defense, Coast Guard and PHS. Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76.0% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\n•340B Discounted Pricing: To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive certain types of grants under the PHS Act. For all of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will not exceed the amount determined under statute (the “ceiling price”) when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMP and is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. \n\nOUTSIDE THE U.S.\n\nOutside the U.S., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products and may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many countries are continuing to cause governments \n\n26\n\n\nto consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. \n\nREGULATION PERTAINING TO SALES AND MARKETING\n\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\n\nLaws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal “sunshine” provisions. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.\n\nOTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nFOREIGN ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\nWe are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\n\nThe laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include significant fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.\n\nNIH GUIDELINES\n\nWe seek to conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in RTP, North Carolina and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.\n\n27\n\n\nOTHER LAWS\n\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Laws, regulations and recommendations relating to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.\n\nData Privacy\n\nRegulators currently impose data privacy and security requirements, which include monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. adopted a comprehensive GDPR in 2016 to replace the current E.U. Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the E.U. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20.0 million or 4.0% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. In addition, several U.S. jurisdictions have similar data privacy laws, such as the CCPA and California Privacy Rights Act.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nWe seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we regularly review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. We believe that our manufacturing facilities, together with the third-party contract manufacturing organizations we outsource to, currently provide sufficient capacity for our products and to Samsung Bioepis, our collaboration partner that develops, manufactures and markets biosimilar products, and other strategic contract manufacturing partners.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021 we began construction of a new gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina to support our gene therapy pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. We estimate the construction of this manufacturing facility will be completed during 2025. As we continue to advance our research and development prioritization efforts, which includes refocusing our investment in gene therapy, we are evaluating several alternative uses for this facility.\n\nMANUFACTURING FACILITIES\n\nOur manufacturing facilities include:\n\nFacilityProduct Manufactured\n\nRTP, North CarolinaAVONEX\n\nPLEGRIDY\n\nTYSABRI\n\nQALSODY\n\nOther*\n\nSolothurn, SwitzerlandLEQEMBITYSABRI\n\n* Other includes products manufactured for contract manufacturing partners.\n\nIn addition to our drug substance manufacturing facilities, we have a drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in RTP, North Carolina, including a parenteral facility and an oral solid dose products manufacturing facility. \n\nThe parenteral facility adds capabilities and capacity for filling biologics into vials and is used for filling product candidates. The oral solid dose products facility can supplement our outsourced small molecule manufacturing capabilities.\n\n28\n\n\nWe have an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina. This facility gives us the capability to manufacture both commercial and clinical ASOs, including QALSODY, and beginning in 2025 this facility will manufacture SPINRAZA.\n\nIn order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland. In the second quarter of 2021 a portion of the facility (the first manufacturing suite) received a GMP multi-product license from SWISSMEDIC and was placed into service. The second manufacturing suite, which was also licensed to operate by SWISSMEDIC, became operational in the first quarter of 2024. Solothurn has been approved for the manufacture of LEQEMBI.\n\nGenentech is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk requirements to a third party.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS\n\nWe principally use third parties to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final product for our small molecule products and product candidates, including TECFIDERA, VUMERITY and FUMADERM, and the final drug product for our large molecule products and, to a lesser extent, product candidates. \n\nWe source the majority of our fill-finish and all of our final product assembly and storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our label and packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Raw materials, delivery devices, such as syringes and auto-injectors, and other supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are procured from various third-party suppliers and manufacturers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. We endeavor to assure continuity of supply of such raw materials, devices and supplies through inventory management and dual sourcing as appropriate. Our third-party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers may be subject to routine cGMP inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions and undergo assessment and certification by our quality management group. In addition, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI was acquired by a third party in December 2024. We have evaluated the impact this will have on our biosimilars business and have mitigation activities in progress designed to ensure supply continuity.\n\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOur Corporate Responsibility strategy and programs are designed to deliver meaningful results in the areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact. We have bolstered our efforts in access and health equity and refocused our Biogen Foundation efforts in the communities where we operate and to help deliver better health. Our environmental strategy is designed to balance impact in line with investment and to drive sustainability into our core operations.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nCorporate Responsibility oversight is formally embedded into our Board of Directors' corporate governance principles. Our Board of Directors annually reviews our Corporate Responsibility strategy, progress and goals. We also regularly review our environmental commitments within the context of our business performance and external challenges. We remain committed to engaging employees and suppliers.\n\nAs part of our broader commitment to these priorities, we continue to tie a portion of our employees' and executive officers' compensation to advancing our Corporate Responsibility priorities.\n\nOur Executive Committee has responsibility for evaluating the impact of climate change on the business and overseeing actions taken by the company to limit its adverse impact on the environment.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur Board of Directors believes that a fundamental part of risk management is identifying and understanding the risks we face, monitoring these risks and adopting appropriate controls and mitigation of such risks. Our Board of Directors and its committees are responsible for reviewing our risk framework and governance and management's exercise of its responsibility to assess, monitor and manage our significant risk exposures. Our Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, which is designed to support execution of our strategy and achievement of our objectives to improve long-term operational and financial performance and enhance stockholder value.\n\n29\n\n\nWe have a company-wide ERM program to identify, mitigate and monitor enterprise-level risks that may affect our ability to achieve our objectives. The ERM program is overseen by our ERM Committee, a cross-functional group of business leaders representing all of our key business functions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the greatest risks to our business, their underlying risk drivers and the associated mitigation activities and controls.\n\nCLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe believe that the areas of risk that are fundamental to the success of our enterprise and rise to enterprise-level risks includes, among other things, environmental matters. Our ERM framework is designed to ensure climate-related risks and opportunities are monitored and integrated into our overall business strategy. Our ERM process includes evaluating identified risks, including any climate-related physical and transition risks, by engaging leaders across the company.\n\nWe identify climate risk as the risk of loss arising from climate change which comprises both physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk considers how the physical impacts of climate change (e.g., increased frequency and intensity of storms, drought, fires, floods) can directly damage physical assets or otherwise impact their value or productivity. Transition risk considers how changes in policy, regulations, culture, technology, business practices and market preferences to address climate change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy) can lead to changes in the value of assets and businesses. Disruption in supply chains, changing customer expectations in the biosimilars market and potential shifts in the regulatory environment that disadvantage the use of fossil fuels, PFAS or other materials may make it difficult for us to fulfill business obligations or cause us to incur substantial expense.\n\nIdentified climate-related material risks and opportunities are reported to our ERM team, which reports to our ERM Committee with oversight by our Board of Directors. We endeavor to consider and address those risks and opportunities that are financially material and may impact our business model, as well as mitigation measures that are in place or need to be adopted.\n\nFor additional information on our environment-related risks, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\n\nCLIMATE-RELATED DISCLOSURES\n\nWe monitor global climate-related disclosure requirements to prepare for reporting, progress activities and publish materials designed to ensure our compliance under applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe E.U., California and certain other countries in which we do business have enacted legislation and regulations to enhance disclosures related to the impacts of climate-related matters. The E.U.'s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will require expansive disclosures on various environmental and social matters for companies whose business and assets exceed certain thresholds within E.U. countries. California's environmental disclosure laws will impose additional climate-related reporting requirements on large companies conducting business in the state of California.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,605 employees worldwide. Approximately 4,255 employees were employed in the U.S. and approximately 3,350 employees were employed in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2024, 30.9% of Biogen’s U.S. manager-level and above positions were held by ethnic or racial minorities. Globally, 48.3% of Biogen’s positions at the director-level and above were held by women as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCULTURE AND ENGAGEMENT\n\nOur values and merit-based culture guide every action we take, from pioneering new therapies to promoting health access for all patients. To continue to build on our strong culture, we implemented the New Biogen Way, aimed at maintaining our spirit of innovation and patient-centricity while advancing a more entrepreneurial business mindset and results-focused approach.\n\nThese are the essentials that are designed to work together to help us successfully achieve our mission:\n\n30\n\n\nPioneer: We boldly advance rigorous science to drive innovation in medicine.\n\nThink broadly: We are humble and curious, integrating external and internal advancements to successfully compete.\n\nDrive results: We achieve high performance and have a greater impact by being decisive and solution-oriented, while effectively managing risk.\n\nEthical: We act with the highest integrity with each other and all who place their trust in us.\n\nInclusive: We are open and embrace and leverage differences, as well as treat everyone with care and dignity.\n\nWe use an employee survey program to understand employee engagement, giving employees an opportunity for feedback. The survey is designed to empower managers and leaders with anonymous information on their practices related to building culture, performance and an engaged workforce, allowing them to create plans and measure efficacy for continuous improvement. We care about employee feedback and are building an analytics community across Human Resources to bring more rigor and sophistication to the collection and analysis of employee opinions. We use those employee perspectives to guide us to take actions that are designed to improve engagement and support and help maintain our reputation as a great place to work for all our employees.\n\nGLOBAL COMPETENCY\n\nMany factors influence employee success and well-being. We work to foster a workplace to allow employees to deliver on our shared mission. From career development to wellness to workplace environment, there are many opportunities to meet employee needs, and to build a workplace where people are empowered to learn, grow and build rewarding careers. Our employees are encouraged to take advantage of an array of professional development resources. Managers are trained to coach employees for performance, and to engage in employee development discussions to support growth and learning.\n\nOpportunities for ongoing learning can contribute to employee engagement and success. Development occurs through on-the-job learning, challenging new assignments, leadership development programs, instructor-led training, online learning, mentoring and more. With some employees continuing to work from home, virtual learning plays a key role. Virtual learnings are available through Biogen University as well as Coursera.\n\nTo create and sustain an inclusive workplace reflective of the patients we serve, we offer programs that invest in our talent pipeline and in our current leaders, including:\n\n•Global Leadership Summit: Immersing leaders in topics designed to help them shape culture and build resilience.\n\n•Advance Your Leadership Potential: Preparing high-potential individual contributors for first-level leadership roles.\n\n•Executive Coaching: Coaching program available to support individuals as they work toward enhancing their impact in the organization.\n\nSUCCESSION PLANNING\n\nEach year we conduct a talent review across our global enterprise that includes, among other important topics, a review of succession plans for many of our roles. To help ensure the long-term continuity of our business, we actively manage the development of talent to fill the roles that are most critical to the ongoing success of our Company. In addition, each year our Board of Directors reviews the succession plan for our executives.\n\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nOur approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver merit-based cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology industry, and to attract, motivate and retain talent to build a strong, engaged and productive workforce that is equipped to deliver forward-looking business priorities.\n\nWe establish components and ranges of compensation based on market and benchmark data. Within this context, we strive to pay all employees fairly within a reasonable range, taking into consideration factors such as role; merit; market data; job location; relevant experience; and individual, business unit and company performance. In addition, we are committed to providing flexible benefits designed to allow our global workforce to have reward opportunities that meet their varied needs so that they are inspired to perform their best on behalf of patients and stockholders each day. We regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the fairness of compensation decisions, for individual employees and our workforce as a whole.\n\n31\n\n\nRECRUITMENT AND RETENTION\n\nWe seek to recruit and retain highly qualified employees. A business-wide priority is to strengthen our culture and the employee experience. We believe our wellness initiatives and flexible work arrangements empower employees, increasing workplace satisfaction and allowing us to retain and attract key talent. We examine employee total rewards across four pillars: physical, financial, emotional and social well-being. We regularly assess our global benefits, and we believe we remain competitive with other companies in terms of comprehensive total rewards. We also conduct affordability analyses to benchmark whether our benefits program costs are appropriate and fair.\n\nOur total rewards program is designed to meet the needs of employees in local markets and includes retirement savings plans, financial advising, LTI plans and incentive grants, company-paid life insurance and disability coverage, tuition reimbursement and college-planning services. Our global employee assistance program provides support to all employees and their family members worldwide.\n\nWORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nThe safety and well-being of our employees is a priority for Biogen, and we believe every employee plays a role in creating a safe and healthy workplace. Our employees have varied roles and functions, which is why we empower them to promote a safe working environment, regardless of whether work happens in the lab, in an office or in a manufacturing facility. Our EHS policies and practices are intended to protect not only our employees, but also the surrounding communities where we operate.\n\nWe maintain an EHS management system, which documents our health and safety management practices, including the following elements:\n\n•risk and opportunity assessments to identify what could cause harm in the workplace;\n\n•prioritization and integration of action plans with quantified targets to address those risks;\n\n•integration of actions to prepare for and respond to emergency situations;\n\n•evaluation of progress in reducing/preventing health issues/risks against targets;\n\n•procedures to investigate work-related injuries, ill health, diseases and incidents; and\n\n•training to employees and contractors to raise awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents.\n\nWe have also introduced safety criteria in our procurement and contractual requirements.\n\nOUR CULTURE OF INCLUSION\n\nWe are committed to merit-based opportunities and believe discrimination is unacceptable. We believe an inclusive workplace fosters innovation and helps us to better support patients. Our strategy outlines steps to build our talent and strengthen our leadership, improve health outcomes for patients in the disease areas we treat and contribute to the communities where we live and work.\n\nOur ERGs are formed by interested employees and sponsored by a senior leader of the company. Membership of each ERG is open to all employees. Our ERGs provide opportunities for employees to build connections, foster leadership development and cultivate a sense of belonging. Our current ERGs include:\n\n•AccessAbility: Supports employees with disabilities and employees who are caregivers of individuals with disabilities and their allies.\n\n•Biogen Veterans Network: Encourages veterans and allies to connect and support one another.\n\n•IGNITE: Brings together early-career professionals and their allies.\n\n•Mosaic: Fosters awareness and appreciation of different cultural backgrounds, in addition to promoting networking and development opportunities for employees.\n\n•ourIMPACT: Addresses environmental issues at work, in employees' personal lives and in the communities where we live and work.\n\n•Parenting Network Group: Provides support, networking and development opportunities to working parents and caregivers, as well as helping employees navigate the challenges of work-life balance.\n\n•ReachOUT: Brings together LGBTQ+ employees and their allies.\n\n•Women’s Impact Network: Creates networking, mentoring and learning opportunities for women and allies worldwide.\n\n32\n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (as of February 12, 2025)\n\nOfficerCurrent PositionAgeYear Joined Biogen\n\nChristopher A.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe are substantially dependent on revenue from our products. \n\nOur revenue depends upon continued sales of our products as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated on sales of our products in increasingly competitive markets. Any of the following negative developments relating to any of our products or any of our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations or could cause a decline in our stock price: \n\n•the introduction, greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement of competing products, including new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n\n•safety or efficacy issues;\n\n•limitations and additional pressures on product pricing or price increases, including those relating to inflation and those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements, including those relating to any future potential drug price negotiation under the IRA; increased competition, including from generic or biosimilar versions of our products; or changes in, or implementation of, reimbursement policies and practices of payors and other third-parties;\n\n•adverse legal, administrative, geopolitical events, regulatory or legislative developments; or\n\n•our ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others, which may be impacted by our pricing and reimbursement decisions.\n\nLEQEMBI is in the early stages of commercial launch in the U.S. and certain international markets and SKYCLARYS is in the early stages of commercial launch in the U.S. and certain European markets. In addition to risks associated with new product launches and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, Biogen’s and Eisai’s ability to successfully commercialize LEQEMBI and our ability to successfully commercialize SKYCLARYS may be adversely affected due to:\n\n•Eisai’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for LEQEMBI;\n\n•the effectiveness of Eisai's and Biogen’s commercial strategy for marketing LEQEMBI;\n\n•requirements such as participation in a registry and the use of imaging or other diagnostics for LEQEMBI;\n\n•our ability to obtain approval in other markets;\n\n•the approval of other new products for the same or similar indications;\n\n•Eisai’s and Biogen’s ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others in the Alzheimer’s disease community, which may be impacted by pricing and reimbursement decisions relating to LEQEMBI, which are made by Eisai and/or third parties;\n\n•Biogen's ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for SKYCLARYS; and\n\n•the effectiveness of Biogen's commercial strategy for marketing SKYCLARYS.\n\nOur long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products and additional indications for our existing products.\n\nOur long-term success will depend upon the successful development of new products from our research and development activities or our licenses or acquisitions from third parties, as well as additional indications for our existing products. Product development is very expensive and involves a high degree of uncertainty and risk and may not be successful. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. It is difficult to predict the success and the time and cost of product development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases. The development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, including development efforts in new modalities such as those based on the antisense oligonucleotide platform and gene therapy, presents additional challenges and risks, including obtaining approval from regulatory authorities that have limited experience with the development of such therapies. For example, we are currently seeking approval of LEQEMBI in Europe and the approval of a subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI in the U.S. and any delays or challenges may impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from LEQEMBI.\n\nClinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and even if we view data as sufficient to support the safety, effectiveness and/or approval of an investigational therapy, regulatory authorities may disagree and may require additional data, limit the scope of the approval or deny approval altogether. Furthermore, the approval of a product candidate by one regulatory agency does not mean that other regulatory agencies will also approve such product candidate.\n\nSuccess in preclinical work or early-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that may significantly reduce or delay the likelihood of regulatory approval. This may result in terminated programs, significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the product candidate.\n\nEven if we could successfully develop new products or indications, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product candidate or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or we prioritize other opportunities in our pipeline. \n\nAdditionally, sales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet investor expectations.\n\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on the market and in the product pipeline, substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages. \n\nOur products continue to face increasing competition from the introduction of new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Some of these products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than our branded products. The introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products has reduced, and may in the future, significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. For instance, demand and price for TECFIDERA declined significantly as a result of multiple TECFIDERA generic entrants entering the U.S. market in 2020. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it has in the past and may in the future be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\n\nOur ability to compete, maintain and grow our business may also be adversely affected due to a number of factors, including:\n\n•the introduction of other products, including products that may be more efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our products, including our own products and products of our collaborators;\n\n•the off-label use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat patients; \n\n•patient dynamics, including the size of the patient population and our ability to identify, attract and maintain new and current patients to our therapies;\n\n•the reluctance of physicians to prescribe, and patients to use, our products without additional data on the efficacy and safety of such products;\n\n•damage to physician and patient confidence in any of our products, generic or biosimilars of our products or any other product from the same class as one of our products, or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes, pricing and reimbursement decisions or adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with our products or generic or biosimilars of our products;\n\n•inability to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing and adequate reimbursement for our products compared to our competitors in key markets; or\n\n•our ability to obtain and maintain patent, data or market exclusivity for our products.\n\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute or realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic and growth initiatives.\n\nThe successful execution of our strategic and growth initiatives depends upon internal development projects, commercial initiatives and external opportunities, which may include the acquisition and in-licensing of products, technologies, companies, the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations or our Fit for Growth program, as well as our ability to execute on strategic decisions and initiatives.\n\nWhile we believe we have a number of promising programs in our pipeline, failure or delay of internal development projects to advance or difficulties in executing on our commercial initiatives could impact our current and future growth, resulting in additional reliance on external development opportunities for growth. \n\n39\n\n\nSupporting the further development of our existing products and potential new products in our pipeline will require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing capabilities and other areas of our business. We have made, and may continue to make, significant operating and capital expenditures for potential new products prior to regulatory approval with no assurance that such investment will be recouped, which may adversely affect our financial condition, business and operations.\n\nThe availability of high quality, fairly valued external product development is limited and the opportunity for their acquisition is highly competitive. As such, we are not certain that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisition or if we will be able to reach agreement to make any such acquisition if suitable candidates are identified.\n\nWe may fail to initiate or complete transactions for many reasons, including failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals as well as a result of disputes or litigation. Furthermore, we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from transactions or strategic decisions, such as the decision to retain the biosimilars business, or the benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We may also face additional costs or liabilities in completed transactions that were not contemplated prior to completion.\n\nAny failure in the execution of a transaction, in the integration of an acquired asset or business or in achieving expected synergies could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we recently acquired Reata and HI-Bio and are in the process of integrating Reata and HI-Bio into our Company. The ultimate success of our acquisitions of Reata and HI-Bio and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisitions, including future performance of the SKYCLARYS product and further development of the felzartamab product and anticipated synergies, depends on, among other things, how effective we are in integrating the Biogen, Reata and HI-Bio operations.\n\nWe face risks associated with our Fit for Growth program that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated savings and operational efficiencies or that may otherwise harm our business. These risks include delays in implementation of cost optimization actions, loss of workforce capabilities, higher than anticipated separation expenses, litigation and the failure to meet financial and operational targets. In addition, the calculation of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits resulting from our Fit for Growth program are subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if we experience delays or unforeseen events, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage, or a reduction in pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product, diagnosis of the condition it treats and the cost to administer it may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed. \n\nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n•changes in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors’ reimbursement policies; \n\n•pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n\n•consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value;\n\n•our ability to receive reimbursement for our products or our ability to receive comparable reimbursement to that of competing products; and\n\n•our value-based contracting program pursuant to which we aim to tie the pricing of our products to their clinical values by either aligning price to patient outcomes or adjusting price for patients who discontinue therapy for any reason, including efficacy or tolerability concerns.\n\nOur ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other \n\n40\n\n\ncountries and using those reference prices to set a price). Drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed; for example the IRA has certain provisions related to drug pricing, including the ability for the U.S. government to set prices for certain drugs in Medicare. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. Certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the revenue from our products within that country but may also adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which may limit market growth and result in reductions in revenue. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenue. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions governmental health agencies may adjust, retroactively and/or prospectively, reimbursement rates for our products. Reimbursement for our products by governments, including the timing of any reimbursements, may also be affected by budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. Government agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. There can be no assurance that the economic, budgeting or political issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales or reimbursements of our products.\n\nCompetition from current and future competitors may negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share. New products marketed by our competitors could cause our revenue to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the introduction of generic or biosimilar versions of our products, follow-on products, prodrugs or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways may significantly reduce the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell.\n\nMany payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.\n\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators and other third-parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates, which are outside of our full control, and if these relationships fail, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on a number of collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. We also outsource certain aspects of our regulatory affairs and clinical development relating to our products and product candidates to third-parties. Reliance on third-parties subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\n•we may be unable to control the resources our collaborators or third-parties devote to our programs, products or product candidates, which may affect our ability to achieve development goals or milestones;\n\n•disputes may arise under an agreement, including with respect to the achievement and payment of milestones, payment of development or commercial costs, ownership of rights to technology developed, and the underlying agreement may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborators or third-parties fail to perform; \n\n•the interests of our collaborators or third-parties may not always be aligned with our interests, and such parties may not protect and enforce any intellectual property rights or pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenue, or may adopt tax strategies that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition; \n\n•third-party relationships require the parties to cooperate, and failure to do so effectively could adversely affect product sales or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of product candidates under joint control, \n\n41\n\n\ncould result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or could result in litigation or arbitration;\n\n•any failure on the part of our collaborators or third-parties to comply with applicable laws, including tax laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations or to fulfill any responsibilities they may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products could have an adverse effect on our revenue or reputation as well as involve us in possible legal proceedings; and\n\n•any improper conduct or actions on the part of our collaborators or third-parties could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and injunctive penalties, require management attention, impact the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and/or adversely impact our ability to conduct business, our operating results and our reputation.\n\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed, revenue from products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements.\n\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\n\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs (including those contained in the IRA) and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed, purchased and reimbursed. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act and similar state legislation. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business. \n\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\n\nThere is substantial public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. In addition, there have been (including elements of the IRA), and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing. We face uncertainties regarding potential healthcare reforms, governmental policy and prioritization, and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. \n\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets, that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expense may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products. \n\nIn the E.U. and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenue and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in the future.\n\n42\n\n\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars. If we are unsuccessful in such activities, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nThe development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products require specialized expertise and are very costly and subject to complex regulation. Our success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n•Reliance on Third-Parties. We are dependent, in part, on the efforts of collaboration partners and other third-parties over whom we have limited or no control in the development and manufacturing of biosimilars products. For example, a recently completed acquisition of a contract development and manufacturing organization by a third party may impact its operational, strategic or financial risk. If these third-parties fail to perform successfully, or reduce their third party manufacturing production, our biosimilar product development or commercialization of biosimilar products could be delayed, revenue from biosimilar products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements;\n\n•Competitive Challenges. Biosimilar products face significant competition, including from innovator products and biosimilar products offered by other companies that may receive greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement. Local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and sold in some jurisdictions. The number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in a timely and cost-effective manner are additional factors that may impact our success in this business area;\n\n•Regulatory Compliance. Biosimilar products may face regulatory hurdles or delays due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and commercial pathway of biosimilars products in certain jurisdictions;\n\n•Ability to Provide Adequate Supply. Manufacturing biosimilars is complex. If we encounter any persistent manufacturing or supply chain difficulties we may be unable to meet demand. We are dependent on a third-party for the manufacture of our biosimilar products and such third-party may not perform its obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations and may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future biosimilar products. For example, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI was acquired by a third party in December 2024, which may have an impact on our biosimilars business;\n\n•Intellectual Property and Regulatory Challenges. Biosimilar products may face extensive intellectual property clearances and infringement litigation, injunctions or regulatory challenges, which could prevent the commercial launch of a product or delay it for many years or result in imposition of monetary damages, penalties or other civil sanctions and damage our reputation; and\n\n•Failure to Gain Market and Patient Acceptance. Market success of biosimilar products will be adversely affected if patients, physicians and/or payors do not accept biosimilar products as safe and efficacious products offering a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed. \n\nOur success, including our long-term viability and growth, depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patent protection and/or regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and other important markets remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We may fail to obtain, defend or preserve patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, or the protection we obtain may not be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business, which could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. In addition, settlements of such proceedings often result in reducing the period of exclusivity and other protections, resulting in a reduction in revenue from affected products.\n\nIn many markets, including the U.S., manufacturers may be allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator's product and do not need to conduct clinical trials before marketing a competing version of a product after there is no longer patent or regulatory exclusivity. In such cases, manufacturers often charge significantly lower prices and a major portion of the company's revenue may be reduced in a short period of time. In addition, manufacturers of generics and biosimilars may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or other intellectual property protections.\n\n43\n\n\nFurthermore, our products may be determined to infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third-parties. Legal proceedings, administrative challenges or other types of proceedings are and may in the future be necessary to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third-parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Legal proceedings may also be necessary to determine the rights, obligations and payments claimed during and after the expiration of intellectual property license agreements we have entered with third parties. Such proceedings are unpredictable and are often protracted and expensive. Negative outcomes of such proceedings could hinder or prevent us from manufacturing and marketing our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. A failure to obtain necessary licenses for an infringed product or technology could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain could reduce our profits from the covered products and services. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\n\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of Our Products and Product Candidates\n\nSuccessful preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.\n\nPositive results in a clinical trial have in the past and may not in the future be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials. Additionally, success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may delay or decline approval of our product candidates. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data, require additional studies, disagree with our trial design or endpoints or not approve adequate reimbursement. Regulatory authorities may also fail to approve the facilities or processes used to manufacture a product candidate, our dosing or delivery methods or companion devices. Regulatory authorities have in the past and may in the future grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated, including limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring, educational requirements, requiring confirmatory trials and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expense, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\n\nClinical trials and the development of biopharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.\n\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely fashion depends on a number of key factors, including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, patient enrollment rates and compliance with current Good Clinical Practices. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or denied.\n\nWe have opened clinical trial sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is limited. In most cases, we use the services of third-parties to carry out our clinical trial related activities and rely on such parties to accurately report their results. Our reliance on third-parties for these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. One CRO has responsibility for a substantial portion of our activities and reporting related to our clinical trials and if such CRO does not adequately perform, many of our trials may be affected, including adversely affecting our expenses associated with such trials. We may need to replace our CROs, which may result in the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates.\n\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.\n\nAdverse safety events involving our marketed products, generic or biosimilar versions of our marketed products or products from the same class as one of our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and/or the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in adverse impacts on our results of operations. \n\n44\n\n\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales to decline or our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\n\nRestrictions on use or safety warnings that may be required to be included in the label of our products may significantly reduce expected revenue for those products and require significant expense and divert management time.\n\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\nA breakdown or breach of our information systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\n\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information systems and data to operate our business. Changes in how we operate have caused us to modify our business practices in ways that heighten this dependence, including changing the requirement that most of our office-based employees in the U.S. and our other key markets work from the office, with many of our employees now working in hybrid or full-remote positions. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business and our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our information systems and data, which includes use of cloud technologies, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Breakdowns, invasions, corruptions, destructions and/or breaches, which may include impacts such as, but not limited to, comprising the capacity, reliability or security of our information systems or those of our business partners, including our cloud technologies, and/or unauthorized access to our data and information could subject us to significant liability, negatively impact our business operations, and/or require replacement of technology and/or sizeable ransom payments. Our information systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, increasing our vulnerability when breakdowns, malicious intrusions and random attacks occur. Data privacy or security breaches also pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.\n\nCybersecurity threats and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, particularly when they impact vendors, customers or suppliers, and other companies in our supply chain. Cybersecurity threats and incidents are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and may include or target employees or contractors acting with careless or malicious intent. Recent developments in the threat landscape include use of adversarial AI techniques and machine learning, as well as an increased number of cyber extortion attacks, with higher financial ransom demand amounts and increasing sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. Geopolitical instability, including that related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or the conflict in the Middle East, may increase the risk of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats or incidents may include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and data. Cybersecurity threats and incidents also include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or products produced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information.\n\nWhile we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure, including our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cybersecurity threats or incidents in our systems and any such incidents could materially adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in material financial, legal, operational or reputational harm to us, loss of competitive advantage or loss of consumer confidence. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\n\nRegulations continue to change as regulators worldwide consider new rules. For example, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure rules regarding cyber security risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting by public companies. These new regulations or other regulations being considered in Europe and around the world may impact the manner in which we operate.\n\n45\n\n\nRegulators currently impose new data privacy and security requirements, including monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation established regulations regarding the handling of personal data, and provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. U.S. data privacy and security laws, such as the CCPA, and others that may be passed, similarly introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with the CCPA may result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current and future laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nThe increasing use of AI-based software presents new risks and challenges and could adversely affect our business and reputation.\n\nThe use of AI-based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical industry, including by us, such as for research, marketing, manufacturing and commercialization, and we expect to use technology that uses AI in the future. As with many developing technologies, AI-based software presents risks and challenges. For example, algorithms may be flawed; data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality or contain biased information; and inappropriate or controversial data practices could impair results. If the analyses that AI-based software assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. Use of AI-based software may also lead to cybersecurity risks or the release of confidential proprietary information, including personal data, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property or violate our internal policies, data protection laws or contractual requirements. The use of AI-based software may also result in unauthorized access of personal data or the intellectual property of third parties. Since the use of AI is subject to new or evolving laws and regulations, compliance may impose operational costs and limit our ability to use AI-based software, and failure to comply may result in potential government actions, litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity.\n\nManufacturing issues could substantially increase our costs, limit supply of our products and/or reduce our revenue.\n\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks, including:\n\n•Risks of Reliance on Third-Parties and Single Source Providers. We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for many aspects of our manufacturing process for our products and product candidates. In some cases, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, we rely on single source providers of raw materials and manufacturing supplies. These third-parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational, strategic and financial risks that are outside of our control. For example, a recently completed acquisition of a contract development and manufacturing organization by a third party may impact its operational, strategic or financial risk. These third-parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations, and they may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of the services and the need to obtain regulatory approval of any significant changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of such alternatives.\n\n•Global Bulk Supply Risks. We rely on our manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance for our large molecule products and product candidates. Our global bulk supply of these products and product candidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor or raw material shortages, geopolitical instability, public health epidemics, natural disasters, adverse weather events, power failures, cyber-attacks and many other factors.\n\n•Risks Relating to Compliance with current GMP (cGMP). We and our third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent requirements, as applicable, and are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or operations or those of third-parties to receive regulatory approval or pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.\n\n•Risk of Product Loss. The manufacturing process for our products is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, oxidation, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered \n\n46\n\n\nin our products or manufacturing facilities, we may need to close our manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.\n\nAny adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products.\n\nFurthermore, factors such as geopolitical events, global health outbreaks, adverse weather events, labor or raw material shortages, imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions and other supply chain disruptions could result in difficulties and delays in manufacturing our products, which could have an adverse impact on our results in operations or result in product shortages. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expense for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation. \n\nIn addition, although we have business continuity plans to reduce the potential for manufacturing disruptions or delays and reduce the severity of a disruptive event, there is no guarantee that these plans will be adequate, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nManagement, personnel and other organizational changes may disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty retaining personnel or attracting and retaining qualified replacements on a timely basis for the management and other personnel who may leave the Company, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations.\n\nChanges in management, other personnel and our overall retention rate may disrupt our business, and any such disruption could adversely affect our operations, programs, growth, financial condition or results of operations. New members of management may have different perspectives on programs and opportunities for our business, which may cause us to focus on new opportunities or reduce or change emphasis on our existing programs.\n\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining talent for a number of reasons, including management changes, integration related to the Reata and HI-Bio acquisitions, the underperformance or discontinuation of one or more marketed, pre-clinical or clinical programs, recruitment by competitors or changes in the overall labor market. In addition, changes in our organizational structure or in our flexible working arrangements could impact employees' productivity and morale as well as our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\n\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. The FDA and comparable foreign agencies directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, product risk management and our compliance with good practice quality guidelines and regulations. Our interactions with physicians and other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to laws and government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of products and place significant restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. Health care companies are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers and have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of laws and government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including testing, insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. The U.S. government has challenged some of our donations to third-party charities that provide patient assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are found to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these or other patient assistance programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which \n\n47\n\n\nmay have different product distribution methods, marketing programs or patient assistance programs from those we currently utilize or support. \n\nConditions and regulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possible retroactive effect, including:\n\n•new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or judicial decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements; \n\n•changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes, staffing, resources or perspectives that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity; \n\n•government shutdowns or relocations may result in delays to the review and approval process, slowing the time necessary for new drug candidates to be reviewed and/or approved, which may adversely affect our business;\n\n•requirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the EMA's clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action, which could harm our business; and\n\n•changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.\n\nAdditionally, conditions and regulations governing the health care industry in the U.S. are subject to greater risk of change and uncertainty as a result of changes in legislative and regulatory priorities and personnel.\n\nViolations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. We could also be required to repay amounts we received from government payors or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we submitted to the government. In addition, legal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments or settlements sometimes occur. While we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers might violate such laws or regulations. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation or litigation related to alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expense, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\n\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\n\nWe are increasing our presence in international markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenue. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in international markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. Certain countries may require local clinical trial data as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents or distributors and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we collaborate with or acquire in emerging markets.\n\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\n•the impact of public health epidemics on the global economy and the delivery of healthcare treatments;\n\n•less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; \n\n•the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory approvals of products in a timely manner; \n\n•limitations and additional pressures on our ability to obtain and maintain product pricing, reimbursement or receive price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements;\n\n•increased cost of goods due to factors such as inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n\n48\n\n\n•additional complexity in manufacturing or conducting clinical research internationally, including materials manufactured in China or working with CROs in China;\n\n•delays in clinical trials relating to geopolitical instability related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East;\n\n•the inability to successfully complete subsequent or confirmatory clinical trials in countries where our experience is limited;\n\n•longer payment and reimbursement cycles and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; \n\n•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenue, net income and value of certain of our investments; \n\n•the imposition of governmental controls; \n\n•diverse data privacy and protection requirements;\n\n•increasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; \n\n•the anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation across the globe, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;\n\n•compliance with complex import and export control laws;\n\n•changes in tax laws; and\n\n•the imposition of tariffs or embargoes and other trade restrictions.\n\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the U.S. FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, while we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the FCPA, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers might violate the FCPA and we might be held responsible. If our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility and are building a gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility, which will result in the incurrence of significant investment with no assurance that such investment will be recouped.\n\nIn order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we have expanded our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland with no assurance that the additional capacity will be required or this investment will be recouped.\n\nAlthough the Solothurn facility was approved by the FDA for LEQEMBI, there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will approve the Solothurn facility for the manufacturing of other products.\n\nAdditionally, we are building a new gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina with no assurance that this investment will be fully utilized. If we are unable to fully utilize this gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility, charges from excess capacity may occur and would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, our business may be harmed. Charges resulting from excess capacity may continue to occur and would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third-parties of counterfeit or unfit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\n\nThird-parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing, distribution and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be \n\n49\n\n\nat risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. Inventory that is stolen from warehouses, plants or while in-transit, and that is subsequently improperly stored and sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\n\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\n\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear and create uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on social media. We may also encounter criticism on social media regarding our company, management, product candidates or products. The immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings made regarding us via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Our reputation could be damaged by negative publicity or if adverse information concerning us is posted on social media platforms or similar mediums, which we may not be able to reverse. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\n\nRisks Related to Holding Our Common Stock\n\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\n\nOur quarterly revenue, expense and net income have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the risks described in these Risk Factors as well as the timing of charges and expense that we may take. We have recorded, or may be required to record, charges that include:\n\n•the cost of restructurings or other initiatives to streamline our operations and reallocate resources;\n\n•the costs associated with decisions to terminate research and development programs;\n\n•impairments with respect to investments, fixed assets and long-lived assets, including IPR&D and other intangible assets; \n\n•inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges for excess capacity, charges for excess or obsolete inventory and charges for inventory write-downs relating to product suspensions, expirations or recalls; \n\n•changes in the fair value of contingent consideration or our equity investments;\n\n•bad debt expense and increased bad debt reserves;\n\n•outcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters;\n\n•payments in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and other business development activities and under license and collaboration agreements;\n\n•failure to meet certain contractual commitments; and\n\n•the impact of public health epidemics, on employees, the global economy and the delivery of healthcare treatments.\n\nOur revenue and certain assets and liabilities are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from early termination of a hedge relationship.\n\nOur operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the anticipated results of future periods.\n\nOur investments in properties may not be fully realized.\n\nWe own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space and manufacturing operations. We may decide to consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties, some of which may be located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. If we determine that the fair value of any of our owned properties is lower than their book value, we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant \n\n50\n\n\nimpairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the anticipated closing of facilities. If we decide to fully or partially vacate a property, we may incur significant cost, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expense, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. Any of these events may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could increase our financing costs.\n\nWe may seek access to the capital and credit markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other business initiatives. The capital and credit markets are experiencing, and have in the past experienced, extreme volatility and disruption, which leads to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. In the event of adverse market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital or credit market financing on favorable terms which could significantly increase our financing costs. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. \n\nOur indebtedness, together with our significant contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations, could have important consequences to our business; for example, such obligations could: \n\n•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\n•limit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;\n\n•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; and\n\n•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.\n\nWe maintain a portfolio of marketable securities for investment of our cash as well as investments in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies. Changes in the value of our investment portfolio has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our earnings. The value of our investments may decline due to, among other things, increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities in our portfolio, negative company-specific news, biotechnology market sentiment, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, which may negatively affect our stock price.\n\nFrom time to time our Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs. The amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our applicable agreements. Our ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. Additionally, the recently enacted IRA includes an excise tax on share repurchases, which will increase the cost of share repurchases. A reduction in repurchases under, or the completion of, our share repurchase programs could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, if at all.\n\nSome of our collaboration agreements contain change in control provisions that may discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire us.\n\nSome of our collaboration agreements include change in control provisions that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to shareholders. Upon a change in control, some of these provisions could trigger reduced milestone, profit or royalty \n\n51\n\n\npayments to us or give our collaboration partner rights to terminate our collaboration agreement, acquire operational control or force the purchase or sale of the programs that are the subject of the collaboration.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts in our financial statements.\n\nAs a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates, including withholding taxes, in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past or our current expectations due to many factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, interpretations by tax authorities or other bodies with jurisdiction, the result of tax cases, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, especially in the U.S. and Switzerland, and regulations (including the Global Tax Deal Executive Order issued on January 20, 2025) either prospectively or retrospectively and the effects of the integrations of Reata and HI-Bio. \n\nOur inability to secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities and future changes in the tax laws, among other things, may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\n\nThe enactment of some or all of the recommendations set forth or that may be forthcoming in the OECD’s project on “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” by tax authorities and economic blocs in the countries in which we operate, could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate. These initiatives focus on common international principles for the entitlement to taxation of global corporate profits and minimum global tax rates. Many countries have or are in the process of enacting legislation intended to implement the OECD GloBE Model Rules effective on January 1, 2024. The impact on the Company will depend on the timing of implementation, the exact nature of each country's GloBE legislation, guidance and regulations (including the Global Tax Deal Executive Order issued on January 20, 2025) thereon and their application by tax authorities either prospectively or retrospectively.\n\nOur business involves environmental and operational risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.\n\nOur business and the business of several of our strategic partners involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds which make us subject to changing and evolving rules and interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, including permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business. Additionally, regulators have passed new environmental disclosure rules. For example, the E.U., California and certain other countries we do business in have promulgated new climate disclosure rules that will generally require additional disclosure. Additionally, other regulators are considering environmental disclosure rules. These new rules collectively will impose additional disclosure requirements relating to climate-related risks and emissions disclosures. We expect to be subject to these new laws and regulations if or when they go into effect, which would impose extensive reporting obligations about greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks. These recently enacted and proposed regulations may require us to incur compliance and disclosure costs and will likely require substantial management attention.",
