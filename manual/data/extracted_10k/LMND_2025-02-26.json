You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, when investing in our common stock or warrants. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:\n\n•We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\n•Our success and ability to grow our business depend on retaining and expanding our customer base. If we fail to add new customers or retain current customers, our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\n\n•The \"Lemonade\" brand may not become as widely known as incumbents' brands or the brand may become tarnished.\n\n•Denial of claims or our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n•Our future revenue growth and prospects depend on attaining greater value from each user.\n\n•Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance, implementation of our business model, and our future prospects.\n\n•We may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\n\n•Our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to, which could cause us to write policies we should not write, price those policies inappropriately or overpay claims that are made by our customers.\n\n•Intense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to attain or increase profitability.\n\n•Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.\n\n•If we are unable to maintain and implement relationships with third-party service providers, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties are adversely impacted by financial, reputational, regulatory and other risks, our prospects for future growth and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n•If we are unable to expand our product offerings, or expand into new markets, our prospects for future growth may be adversely affected.\n\n•The novelty of our business model makes its efficacy unpredictable and susceptible to unintended consequences.\n\n•We could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Regulators may limit our ability to develop or implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•Existing and new legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n•The insurance business, including the market for renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n•We rely on artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes, and any legal or regulatory requirements that prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n•We may require additional capital to grow our business, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n•Security incidents or real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our systems, website or app could impair our operations, result in loss of personal customer information, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.\n\n•We are periodically subject to examinations by our primary state insurance regulators, which could result in adverse examination findings and necessitate remedial actions.\n\n•If we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\n•Our product development cycles are complex and subject to regulatory approval, and we may incur significant expenses before we generate revenues, if any, from new products.\n\n•Our expansion within the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\n•We are subject to extensive insurance industry regulations.\n\n•State insurance regulators impose additional reporting requirements regarding enterprise risk on insurance holding company systems, with which we must comply as an insurance holding company.\n\n•Severe weather events and other catastrophes, including the effects of climate change and global pandemics, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition.\n\n•Climate risks, including risks associated with disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Increasing scrutiny, actions and changing expectations from investors, clients, regulators, our employees and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may impose additional costs on us, impact our access to capital, or expose us to new or additional risks.\n\n•The impact of the Customer Investment Agreement with General Catalyst is unpredictable, and the arrangement may not function as expected, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality and volatility, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results or in perceptions of our business prospects.\n\n•We rely on data from our customers and third parties for pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, handling claims and maximizing automation, the unavailability or inaccuracy of which could limit the functionality of our products and disrupt our business.\n\n•Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to limitations in the analytical models used to assess and predict our exposure to catastrophe losses.\n\n•Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\n\n•We are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds, and mandatory state insurance facilities, which may affect our ability to achieve profitability.\n\n•As a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively impact our financial performance.\n\n•We conduct certain of our operations in Israel and therefore our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel and the surrounding region.\n\n4\n\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1. Business\n\nOverview\n\nLemonade is rebuilding insurance from the ground up on a digital substrate and an innovative business model. By leveraging technology, data, artificial intelligence, contemporary design, and social impact, we believe we are making insurance more delightful, more affordable, and more precise. To that end, we have built a vertically-integrated company with wholly-owned insurance carriers in the United States and Europe, including the UK and the full technology stack to power them.\n\nA brief chat with our bot, AI Maya, is all it takes to get covered with renters, homeowners, pet, car or life insurance, and we expect to offer a similar experience for other insurance products over time. Claims are filed by chatting with another bot, AI Jim, who pays claims in as little as two seconds. This breezy experience belies the extraordinary technology that enables it: a state-of-the-art platform that spans marketing to underwriting, customer care to claims processing, finance to regulation. Our architecture melds artificial intelligence with the human kind, and learns from the prodigious data it generates to become ever better at delighting customers and evaluating risk.\n\nIn addition to digitizing insurance end-to-end, we also reimagined the underlying business model to minimize volatility while maximizing trust and social impact. To lessen the volatility inherent in an industry directly impacted by the weather, we utilize several forms of reinsurance, with the goal of dampening the impact on our gross margin. The result is that excess claims are generally offloaded to reinsurers, while excess premiums can be donated to nonprofits selected by our customers as part of our annual \"Giveback\". These two ballasts, reinsurance and Giveback, reduce volatility, while creating an aligned, trustful, and values-rich relationship with our customers.\n\nOur Business Model\n\nAt the foundation of our business model is a direct, digital, customer-centric experience that enables rapid growth and strong retention. Our customer-centricity runs deep, and our underlying business model is designed to align interests between us and our customers. This technology-first customer acquisition and retention strategy, combined with our unconflicted business model, results in a highly attractive financial model.\n\nWe leverage technology in everything we do. AI Maya and our APIs sell 98% of Lemonade's policies. Approximately 95% of homeowners insurance policies in the United States are sold via agents, making a platform that finds, onboards, and digitally serves consumers end-to-end very much an outlier. Our digital substrate enables us to integrate marketing and onboarding with underwriting and claims processing, collecting and deploying data throughout, to constantly drive efficient customer acquisition, enhance the customer experience, and mitigate risk. This approach results in significant, rapid scaling coupled with high customer satisfaction.\n\nTo align our interests with those of our customers, encourage good behavior and build a long-term relationship based on mutual trust, we endeavor to decouple our financial incentives from variability in claims. Unlike many of our competitors, we work to minimize incentives to deny legitimate claims as we aim to give back, rather than pocket, leftover monies. Our reinsurance contracts serve to lessen volatility in our operating results, as a material portion of claims are borne by our reinsurance partners. See \"Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business”. In the future, reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAfter our customers purchase a policy, we ask them to designate a charitable cause for us to support. As a result, we believe customers are less inclined to embellish claims as they could be hurting a nonprofit they care about, rather than an insurance company they do not.\n\nStrong retention rates and a subscription-based model create highly-recurring and naturally-growing revenue streams, and provide visibility into our topline results. Our reinsurance construct, in turn, mitigates the bottom-line volatility inherent in traditional insurance companies, where profits quite literally depend on the weather. With our reinsurance agreements offloading residual claims, and our Giveback policy offloading residual premiums, we have two powerful ballasts that reduce volatility, while creating an aligned, trustful, and values-rich relationship with our customers.\n\n5\n\n\nThis combination of a customer-focused onboarding experience, a customer-aligned business model, and a revenue stream that grows along with our customers' insurance needs, has created a sustainable financial model that we are proud of. Over time, we believe our platform will continue to efficiently acquire new customers and give us the ability to service their growing needs at a lower cost, and with higher satisfaction levels, than the industry at large.\n\nOur Technology\n\nData Advantage\n\nOur proprietary and entirely integrated technology stack is a key enabler of our strategy and business model. Interactions with our customers across our platform generate a trove of data, which in turn improves interactions with our customers across our platform.\n\nAI Maya\n\nAI Maya, our playful onboarding and customer experience bot, uses natural language to guide customers through an easy and fun process of joining Lemonade. Maya handles everything from collecting information and personalizing coverage to creating quotes and facilitating payments securely. By asking customers a limited number of high-impact questions, and adapting based on their responses, AI Maya is able to dramatically reduce onboarding times while still collecting and utilizing the data that is central to our continuous improvement.\n\nAI Jim\n\nAI Jim is our claims bot, and, as of December 31, 2024, 96% of the time, it is AI Jim that will take the first notice of loss from a Lemonade customer without human intervention (and with zero claims overhead, known as loss adjustment expense, or “LAE”). As of December 31, 2024, roughly 55% of our claims were automated, resulting in instant or near-instant processing from start to finish. AI Jim triages and assigns claims he is not authorized to settle, or ones where he identifies concerns, to human claims experts, analyzing each expert's specialty, qualifications, workload, and schedule to determine to whom to assign the claim. Even where human escalation is needed, AI Jim will have done much of the heavy lifting so our team can settle claims and support customers in their hour of need as quickly and smoothly as possible.\n\nThe claims process represents the most acute pain point in the insurance experience, and it is where animosity toward the industry is most commonly cultivated. Re-imagining claims for the benefit of the customer, by aligning interests and incentives and by endeavoring to remove friction, hassle, cost, and delays, is therefore a key driver of our leadership in customer satisfaction.\n\nCX.AI\n\nCX.AI is our bot platform built to understand and resolve customer requests without human intervention. Currently, over half of Lemonade’s customer inquiries are handled this way. Customers often require assistance pre- or post-purchase, ranging from coverage questions to making changes to their policy, such as adding a spouse, updating coverage amounts, changing payment methods, or adding newly purchased items. CX.AI uses Natural Language Processing to analyze and understand customers' requests, helping them perform a growing set of tasks.\n\nOur customer-facing technologies, AI Maya, AI Jim, and CX.AI deliver a superior experience at a fraction of the cost, all the while collecting and utilizing far more data than their human counterparts. A similar construct powers the rest of the Company.\n\nOur 'behind the scenes technology' is structured within three proprietary applications: Forensic Graph, Blender, and Cooper.\n\n6\n\n\nForensic Graph\n\nForensic Graph utilizes the combined power of behavioral economics, big data, and AI to predict, deter, detect, and block fraud throughout the customer engagement. The FBI estimates that insurance fraud in the United States (excluding health insurance fraud) costs more than $40 billion per year in increased premiums. It is a complicated problem to solve for traditional insurers, mostly due to data paucity. Forensic Graph tracks untold signals and analyzes relationships between things which may appear trivial or invisible to humans, but in which our machine learning uncovers complex multivariate links that have helped us avoid millions of dollars' worth of potential losses.\n\nBlender\n\nBlender is a robust insurance management platform that we built with customer centricity and exponential efficiency in mind. This is a built-from-scratch, cutting edge backend system, designed as a single, cohesive, and streamlined management tool for our customer experience, underwriting, claims, growth, marketing, finance, and risk teams. When a claims experience specialist logs in to Blender, for example, they instantly see all claims assigned to them by AI Jim. Blender then provides them with instructions for next steps, and when possible, includes coverage determinations, and alerts of suspicious activity. Critically, they will also see an extraordinary amount of information about the users' behavior patterns and their claim, background information, risk indicators, insurance history, and much more. If a vendor is needed, for example, to assess the damage, all appropriate suppliers will pop up in Blender, and can be dispatched to the field, and paid, at the push of a button. Blender brings similar integrated, customer-centric, and focused workflows to the other Lemonade teams as well.\n\nCooper\n\nCooper is our internal bot (we like to think of him as our own Jarvis) who runs important parts of our Company. Cooper handles complex as well as repetitive tasks, from helping our customer experience team handle lengthy, manual processes such as processing paper checks, to automatically running tens of thousands of tests on each release of our software. Cooper continuously analyzes spectrometry imaging beamed from NASA's satellites, identifying wildfires in real time and blocking ads and sales in the affected areas; Cooper collates and formats materials for our regulatory filings; and he even handles most of our engineering task allocation, code deployment, Q&A, and more. Cooper makes our team dramatically more efficient and keeps evolving and learning with time.\n\nForensic Graph, Blender, and Cooper, together with AI Maya, AI Jim, and CX.AI, run atop our Customer Cortex. The Customer Cortex, like a central nervous system, is the place where all data about our customers is transmitted, continuously analyzed, and then used by all six applications.\n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nAcquire more customers\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, about 92% of our current home and renters customers said that they were not switching to Lemonade from another carrier. We are well positioned to grow our customer base by continuing to attract first time buyers, an underserved population replenishing every year.\n\nOur delightful experience and competitive pricing also attract customers who switch from their existing carriers. Our bot automatically files the necessary paperwork to cancel a customer's old policy, removing what is typically a barrier to switching. As we continue to strengthen brand recognition and execute our marketing strategy, we will look to increase the number of customers migrating to the Lemonade platform.\n\n7\n\n\nGrow within our existing customer base\n\nAs our customers move up the economic ladder and through lifecycle events, their insurance needs evolve to higher value products: renters typically acquire more property and frequently upgrade to successively larger homes. Growing households often need car, pet, and life insurance, and additional coverage. These progressions regularly trigger orders of magnitude jumps in insurance premiums, and within states that offer all of Lemonade’s “suite of products” - Renters, Home, Car, Pet, and Life - we see a growing proportion of customers with multiple Lemonade policies and see ripe opportunities for the business. For instance, we see an incredible opportunity for Lemonade Car in selling to our existing customers, allowing us to acquire customers at no cost. Of the more than 2.2 million customers we have today, about 1.2 million already have car insurance—that translates to a potential multi-billion dollar opportunity in car premiums at nearly zero acquisition costs. We aim to provide an unmatched user experience in order to retain customers throughout their lifespan, expanding their lifetime value without incurring any incremental costs of acquisition.\n\nExpand to new products\n\nOur strategy of growing with our customers also lends itself to expanding into new lines of insurance, as lifecycle events trigger the need for additional insurance products.\n\nOur regulatory framework, technology stack, and brand are all extensible to new lines of insurance, and we anticipate that these will contribute to our growth in the future. In the last four years, we have added life, pet and car insurance to our growing portfolio of offerings, and have expanded product offerings in France and the UK to include Buildings insurance, and expect to add additional coverage types over time.\n\n8\n\n\nExpand to new geographies\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we are licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in  50 states of the United States and Washington, D.C. We operate in 39 of those states and Washington, D.C., which collectively represent approximately 93% of the U.S. population. Our strong brand and unique business model drive rapid growth and allow us to quickly gain share in new markets. We also hold a pan-European license, enabling us to passport into and sell in 30 countries across Europe. Under this license we commenced operations in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October 2022, we began selling contents insurance in the United Kingdom (“UK”) in a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime. We expanded our offerings to include Buildings insurance in both France and the UK in April and July 2024, respectively. We also registered two UK branches: (i) Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch (“UK Branch”) and its affiliate (ii) Lemonade Agency B.V.. In May and June 2023 respectively, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for both of these registered branches allowing us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market.\n\nThe Lemonade platform is inherently multilingual and agile by design, so that we can efficiently expand into new markets and new product offerings both within the United States and internationally. \n\nOur Product Offerings\n\nRenters and Homeowners Insurance\n\nWe offer our products to renters and homeowners in the United States, France, and the UK (in addition to liability insurance for the latter two) and contents and liability insurance in Germany and the Netherlands. The insurance we offer in the United States covers stolen or damaged property, and also covers personal liability, which protects our customers if they are responsible for an accident or damage to another person or their property. In a number of states, we also offer landlord insurance policies to condo and co-op owners who rent out their property less than five times a year.\n\nIn 2024, we expanded our offerings to include Buildings insurance in the UK and France, giving homeowners throughout France and the UK the ability to purchase extensive coverage for their home and belongings. Both expansions were supported by existing partnerships with Aviva in the UK and BNP Paribas Cardif in France, providing coverage options unique to each locale through our fully digital experience. \n\nThe full Lemonade experience is available through our iOS and Android apps, as well as through our website. Before a customer purchases one of our policies, we allow the customer to review a summary of their coverage and a sample policy. We also enable the customer to reconfigure their coverage and other policy settings, such as the deductible and start date. After payment via a credit or debit card, we instantly issue the customer their policy documents and send it to them via email. From start to finish, the entire process is completed digitally.\n\nIn the U.S., our products automatically cover all residents of a household who are related to the customer by marriage, blood, or adoption. In addition to the base coverage we offer for personal property, electronics, furniture, and clothing, our customers can purchase extra coverage to protect against accidental loss, damage, and theft, worldwide, of their jewelry, fine art, and other personal property.\n\nPet Insurance\n\nWe currently offer pet insurance that covers diagnostics, procedures, medication, accidents or illness. Even our basic pet insurance offering covers blood tests, urinalysis, X-rays, MRIs, lab work, and CT scans. We also offer two optional add-ons to the basic plan, a wellness package and an extended accident and illness package. These provide additional coverage for preventative care costs, including annual exams and vaccines, and recovery treatments, including physical therapy and hydrotherapy.\n\n9\n\n\nWe believe our expansion into pet insurance will allow us to further achieve our long-term strategy of growing with our young customer base by offering new insurance experiences to customers as they progress in their lifecycles. Our leadership in leveraging AI has also allowed us to create a highly-efficient business. Since launching in 2020, our Pet book of business has increased more than 20x (in IFP), dropped 40 points off the loss ratio, and increased efficiencies by 70%, driving down the cost per claim from $65 to $19. About 83% of our pet insurance policies were sold to new customers, and about 6% of those have already added a renters or homeowners policy to their pet policy as of December 31, 2024. Customers that bundle our insurance offerings typically save money. The remaining 17% or so of pet insurance policies were sold to existing customers, whose median premium per customer grew roughly 3.7x with little to no incremental customer acquisition costs.\n\nCar\n\nWe launched car insurance in December 2021 in Illinois, and now offer it in nine states. Lemonade Car insurance covers car accidents, weather damage, theft and vandalism, damage from fire, trees, or animals, glass and windshield repair, liability for bodily injury and property damage, medical expenses, roadside assistance, and reimburses drivers for expenses relating to temporary transportation when a car is being repaired, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nIn July 2022, we announced the completion of the Metromile Acquisition, a pay-per-mile car insurance provider. As part of the transaction, we acquired a full-stack insurance entity with 49 state licenses plus Washington, D.C., and precision data from more than 500 million car trips. As of December 2024, we have substantially completed the migration of Metromile customers to the Lemonade platform.\n\nLife\n\nLemonade also provides life insurance through a partnership arrangement with a third-party carrier. With Lemonade’s term life insurance offering, individuals can apply online for up to $1.5 million or more in coverage, for a term of 10 to 40 years. Applicants use Lemonade’s interface to receive an initial quote estimate and then are transferred to our partner to complete their final application.\n\nGiveback Feature\n\nGiveback is a distinctive feature, whereby each year we aim to donate leftover money to causes our customers care about. After our customers purchase a policy, we ask them to select, from a pre-vetted list, a charitable cause to support with the residual premiums from their policy. Behind the scenes, customers who select the same charitable cause are classified as members of the same \"cohort.\" Once each year we review the loss ratio of each cohort, and provided that we pass the financial ratio tests required by our regulators, we aim to donate the funds remaining, if any, to the charitable cause selected by that cohort. Cohorts with a loss ratio above 40% usually will not receive a Giveback.\n\nThe Giveback is paid only if payment is authorized by our board of directors in its sole discretion and consistent with its duty of care. See \"Risk Factors — We could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\" Our 2024 Giveback for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2024 amounted to $2,112,608 hitting a milestone of more than $10 million donated since the program’s inception in 2017. We calculate our annual Giveback on each anniversary of our primary reinsurance contract. The Giveback is not a contractual obligation to any customer or to any cause, and customers may not take a tax deduction related to the donations.\n\n10\n\n\nWe have informed, and intend to continue to inform, our customers of the amount donated to their selected nonprofit during each Giveback on an annual basis, details of which follow:\n\nGivebackYearNumber of Nonprofit OrganizationsAmount\n\n202443$2,112,608 \n\n202358$2,008,847 \n\n202259$1,873,588 \n\n202165$2,303,381 \n\n202034$1,128,109 \n\nNonprofit organizations chosen by customers in 2024 included: Charity Water, New Story, Malala Fund, and many others. Although a new and untested concept, we believe that donating a portion of the money left over after paying claims to nonprofits will discourage fraud and promote greater trust between us and our customers. The Giveback program, and our underlying ethos, has also helped build an honest relationship with our consumers. They trust us, and they also become part of a community; our policyholders are helping others while covering their own valuables, insuring their home, or making sure their pet can afford vital medical care.\n\nOur Vertically Integrated Platform\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nOur goal is to increase brand awareness and the number of customers migrating to our platform by utilizing a number of marketing channels to aid our direct-to-consumer sales model. Our primary channel of advertisement is the internet, where we promote our ads and services through various media and social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. We also use the data generated in customer support interactions to constantly refine and improve our marketing campaigns. We conduct drip campaigns via email to follow up with those who have inquired about us or started the on-boarding process. Additionally, we enter into agreements with parties who have access to potential customers, including insurance agencies, apartment building owners, and property management companies.\n\nUnderwriting\n\nOur digital platform enables us to ask fewer questions of our customers but derive many times more data points from each customer interaction than our competitors. Applying machine learning to these data allows us to identify predictive patterns, and these inform our underwriting. Our underwriting process involves collecting this information, classifying and evaluating each individual risk exposure, assessing the impact of the risk on our existing portfolio, and pricing the risk accordingly. When we launched, and had no data of our own, pricing and underwriting were done using easily obtainable industry information. Due to the limitations of these data, customers appeared relatively undifferentiated. \n\nClaims Process\n\nPowered and driven by our technology, our claims process is conducted via our digital platform, which includes our iOS and Android mobile apps. Claims can be substantiated with receipts, notes of where and when the item was purchased, and in certain cases, police reports. We also ask the customer to record a video explaining their claim to enhance the claim review process. After the customer completes a claim report on our mobile app, the customer is asked to enter bank account information. If the claim is approved, a payment is issued and deposited directly into the customer's account. Claims are often paid or declined through our claims bot, AI Jim, within seconds.\n\nWhile a meaningful portion of simple theft and standard pet claims are paid almost instantly, in many cases the incident is also reviewed by a human before the claim is approved, and certain property damage claims or liability claims may take longer to settle. In an event that requires immediate assistance or temporary housing as a result of fire, ongoing water damage, or structural damage that leaves the customer's home exposed, we contact the customer to assess the situation and provide emergency services, such as water or fire damage cleanup, temporary housing, or a designated specialist.\n\n11\n\n\nReinsurance\n\nInsurance often produces businesses with highly recurring revenue streams, and hence predictable top lines, but with significant bottom-line volatility, as profits can literally fluctuate with the weather. Earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires and hurricanes strike with caprice, and can push an otherwise profitable business deep into the red with little or no warning.\n\nThe first-order consequence of this uncertainty is that insurers often see unwelcome swings in their results. The second-order consequence is that regulators require insurers to keep significant reserves to absorb these swings, making them capital intensive. We set out to architect our business to be at once capital-light and possessed of a predictable and growing gross margin. Through judicious use of \"reinsurance,\" we believe we have largely achieved these goals.\n\nReinsurance is a financial instrument under which one insurer, the \"reinsurer,\" agrees to cover a portion of the claims of another insurer, the \"primary insurer,\" in return for a portion of their premiums. While this description characterizes all reinsurance, implementations come in different flavors, each with its own costs and benefits. We have entered into a range of reinsurance agreements, differing in both duration and terms, which combine, we believe, to deliver maximum capital efficiency, while optimizing our gross margin for both stability and size.\n\nProportional Reinsurance: Maximize Capital Efficiency\n\nThe low cost of capital for reinsurance companies creates an opportunity to share premiums and maintain our gross margin while dramatically reducing our capital requirements. We maintain proportional reinsurance contracts which cover all of the Company’s products and geographies, and transfers, or “cedes”, a specified percentage of the premium to reinsurers (“Proportional Reinsurance Contracts”).\n\nUnder U.S. and E.U. regulatory laws, insurance companies are required to set aside \"surplus capital\" in accordance with various formulae. These requirements tend to be more onerous for younger companies experiencing rapid growth, such that without reinsurance we would need to reserve as much as 50 cents for every dollar of premiums sold. Our proportional reinsurance structure shifts most of that surplus capital requirement to the reinsurer, reducing these capital requirements significantly.\n\nNon-Proportional Reinsurance: Optimize Gross Margin\n\nAs described above, our Proportional Reinsurance Contracts provide that we cede a significant portion of our premiums to our reinsurers, pushing our capital efficiency to near maximized levels. We have opted to manage the remaining portion of our business with alternative forms of reinsurance, with a view to maximizing profitability.\n\nThese two remaining goals live in tension with one another: leaving zero \"wiggle room\" around our fixed fee would guarantee its stability, but would preclude our benefiting from our improving loss ratio. Conversely, any room for improved profitability would also introduce additional volatility into our business.\n\nTo balance our desire for both growing and stable gross margin, we set out to structure our remaining reinsurance such that variability in our gross margin will be largely contained, though not eliminated entirely. We believe we have achieved this through a combination of reinsurance structures known as \"per risk reinsurance\" and \"facultative reinsurance\" (the \"Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts\"). Together, these contracts reduce the maximum amount we would need to pay for any one claim.\n\nOur business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes which are inherently unpredictable. To reduce this risk, we also purchase one year property catastrophe excess protection.\n\nIn 2023, we formed a new risk-bearing entity, Lemonade Re SPC, in the Cayman Islands, where we hold some of our retained risk. We also established a captive cell facility at a Bermuda transformer vehicle that is authorized to write and purchase insurance / reinsurance where we retain most of our windstorm exposure.\n\nWe believe our reinsurance structure achieves these important goals: making us capital-light, buffering our gross margin from the vicissitudes of claims, and leaving room for our gross margin to grow.\n\n12\n\n\nDuration\n\nOur goal of maximizing predictability of our results, while growing gross margin over time, led us to vary not only the terms of our reinsurance agreements, but their term, too.\n\nThe Proportional Reinsurance Contracts are issued by a consortium of three reinsurers, including Hannover Ruck SE, MAPFRE Re (Spain), and Swiss Re America (US), each holding an ‘A’ or better rating from A.M. Best, and each holding a share of the agreement’s commitments. In addition, we established a Cayman Islands-based captive reinsurer to which Metromile Insurance Company (“MIC”) cedes approximately 25% of its premiums and losses. \n\nOur Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts are issued by a collection of reinsurers, each holding an ‘A’ or better rating from A.M. Best, have a one-year term that expires on June 30, 2025. We also have a reinsurance contract between Lemonade Insurance Company (“LIC”) and a Bermuda-based segregated cell insurer to cover catastrophe risks over the initial $50,000,000 limit for each loss occurrence, and further subject to a limit of $80,000,000 for each loss occurrence and in aggregate.\n\nWe estimate that approximately half of our book is reinsured through June 30, 2025, and renewed and renegotiated on an annual basis. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance arrangements provide an appropriate balance between maximizing predictability, and enabling us to capture more margin over time.\n\nInvestments\n\nOur portfolio of investable assets is primarily held in cash, money market funds, and fixed income securities which includes U.S. and non-US government and government agencies obligations, corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities with relatively short durations. We manage the portfolio in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by the board of directors.\n\nWe have designed our investment policy and objectives to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital, and liquidity requirements of our operations setting guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate. Furthermore, our investment policy prohibits investments in areas such as oil and gas, coal, tobacco, controversial weapons, and non-compliance with the United Nations Global Compact. The policy, which may change from time to time, is approved by the board of directors and is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the policy evolves in response to changes in the financial markets. See \"Note 4 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe homeowners, pet, car and, to a lesser extent, the renters insurance industries in which we operate are highly competitive. While we believe we are well positioned to execute our business model and reinvent insurance, we face significant competition from traditional insurance companies such as Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, GEICO, Progressive and Travelers. Although we are tapping into markets that our competitors have struggled to reach, the incumbent insurance companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, higher financial ratings, greater resources, additional access to capital. In particular, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase homeowners and multiple other types of insurance products and \"bundle\" them together, and in certain circumstances, to include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond renters and homeowners insurance, pet and car insurance, we may face intense competition from traditional insurance companies that are already established in such markets. Competitors in the pet insurance space include companies such as Nationwide, Embrace, and Trupanion. Competitors in the car insurance space include companies such as Progressive, GEICO and Allstate.\n\nWe also compete with new market entrants. Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, customer service, relationships with brokers and agents (including ease of doing business, service provided, and commission rates paid), size, and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors, and have developed a digital platform and business model based on artificial intelligence and behavioral economics that we believe will be difficult for incumbent insurance providers to emulate.\n\n13\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We intend to rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention of work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have 5 issued patents in the United States. The issued patents generally relate to determining the route and parking location of a vehicle, recording trip data associated with a vehicle, and estimating the usage of a vehicle based on refueling events. The issued patents are expected to expire between September 1, 2035 and January 11, 2036. We do not own any foreign patents and do not have any foreign patent applications pending. As of December 31, 2024, we hold 137 foreign registered trademarks and 10 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Lemonade and Metromile marks, have 4 foreign trademark applications pending and no U.S. trademark applications pending, and hold 3 copyrights in the United States, covering certain videos, texts, photographs, and artwork displayed on our mobile apps and website. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of intellectual property.\n\nIntellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.\n\nCertified B Corp Status\n\nWhile not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have been designated as a Certified B Corp. The term \"Certified B Corp\" does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.\n\nThe first step in becoming a Certified B Corp is completing a comprehensive and objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment varies depending on the company's size (number of employees), and sector. The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corp.\n\nBy completing a set of over 200 questions that reflect impact indicators, best practices, and outcomes, a company receives a composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees, customers, communities, and the environment. Representative indicators in the assessment range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community service, and use of renewable energy.\n\nRecognition as a Certified B Corp currently requires that a company achieve a reviewed assessment score of at least 80. The review process includes a phone review and a random selection of indicators for purposes of verifying documentation. The assessment also includes a corporate structure review and a disclosure questionnaire, including certain practices, fines, and sanctions related to the company or its partners.\n\nOur certification also required us to adopt the public benefit corporation structure, a step we have already completed. Once certified, every Certified B Corp must make its assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website. Acceptance as a Certified B Corp and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent nonprofit organization.\n\n14\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 1,235 employees, 796 of whom were based in the United States and the rest of whom were based outside of the United States, primarily in Israel and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, certain employees are subject to a collective agreement between the Dutch Association of Insurers and various trade unions. The collective agreement covers wages and terms and conditions of employment. Participation in the collective agreement is mandatory for members of the Dutch Association of Insurers, a leading association of private insurance companies operating in the Netherlands. Beyond this, to our knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, and based on public information from five competing insurance companies in the United States, we estimate that the number of customers per employee for those companies ranges from approximately 150 to approximately 450 customers per employee. We base this estimate on publicly available information, which we have adjusted for comparability. The calculation of \"employees\" includes insurance agents and brokers because they are a significant cost component for other insurance companies. In comparison to these competitors, our number of customers per employee was approximately 2,000 as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCulture and Values\n\nOur status as a Certified B Corp and our commitment to charitable giving, in particular our Giveback program, distinguishes us from our competitors, with the goal of building a trusting relationship between us, our employees, and our customers. We value the power of creativity and encourage and support the sharing of ideas to enhance our business model. Like the industry in which we operate, we understand the importance and value of a community pooling its resources together for the public good. We value inclusivity, respecting differences, and seamless teamwork in every facet of our business.\n\nIn 2020, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock as the initial endowment of the Lemonade Foundation, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization established under Arizona law. By contributing approximately 1% of our common stock to the Lemonade Foundation, we hope to promote charitable giving and other community-centric activities with a nexus to our community.\n\nIn 2023, the Foundation launched a first of its kind blockchain-based insurance product for the world’s most vulnerable farmers. The product was built with a goal of protecting subsistence farmers against the effects of climate change. Thousands of families in Kenya have already been protected by this product, and the Foundation expects to continue scaling this product in the coming years. The product was launched as part of the Lemonade Foundation Crypto Climate Coalition - in cooperation with a number of strategic partners, including Hannover Re, Pula, Chainlink, Avalanche, Etherisc and DAOstack.\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nWe understand that strength lies in the unique backgrounds of our employees and drives the innovation behind our product. We encourage employees to bring their lived experiences, and personal strengths, to develop new ideas, improve customer experiences and shape our brand. We engage with employees for ideas of nonprofits to partner with, or resources to learn more about a social issue, and their candid (and anonymous, should they choose) feedback about our workplace culture and environment. Additionally, our employees organize several education groups across the Company addressing these importantt topics.\n\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\n\nAs a B Corp, it is part of our legal mission to advance the health, well-being and equity of employees. To that end, employees have access to health and wellness programs, and healthcare plans.\n\n15\n\n\nGeographic Scope of Business\n\nIn the United States, as of December 31, 2024, LIC and MIC are licensed to sell our insurance products in the following states:\n\nWe also currently hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe. Under this license, we commenced operations in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October 2022, we began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross-border basis under the UK's Temporary Permission Regime. During 2023 Lemonade's UK branch establishments received a third country branch authorization from the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority in the UK allowing us to operate in the UK permanently.\n\nSeasonality\n\nFor information regarding the seasonality of our business, please refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report.\n\n16\n\n\nRegulation of our Business\n\nInsurance Regulation\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. State insurance laws and regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of customers, consumers, and claimants rather than stockholders or other investors. State regulation generally have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of the insurance business. The regulatory requirements and restrictions include, among others, the following:\n\n•approval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\n•approval for intercompany service agreements;\n\n•advertising, marketing, and trade practices; and\n\n•restrictions on the ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or enter into certain related party transactions\n\nRegulation of insurance companies constantly changes as governmental agencies and legislatures react to real or perceived issues. Recently, state insurance regulators have been scrutinizing the industry’s practices with respect to the collection and uses of consumer data.\n\nRequired Licensing\n\nOur regulated U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and admitted in the states of New York and Delaware. Under a provision of the California Insurance Code, MIC is deemed “commercially domiciled” in California, meaning that the California Department of Insurance is entitled to regulate certain aspects of MIC’s business as if it were actually domiciled in California.\n\nLIC, MIC, Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC, Lemonade Life Insurance Agency, LLC, Lemonade E&S Insurance Agency, LLC and Metromile Insurance Services LLC must apply for and maintain licenses to provide and sell insurance in those jurisdictions in which they transact insurance businesses.\n\nOur insurance company and insurance producer subsidiaries are required to adhere to myriad laws and regulatory requirements. The insurance regulators in the states in which our subsidiaries do the business of insurance are empowered to conduct on-site visits and examine the financial affairs and market conduct practices of those entities. Insurance regulators have broad administrative powers to impose monetary penalties and/or restrict or revoke licenses to transact business for violations of applicable laws and regulations.\n\nRestrictions on Paying Dividends\n\nWe are a holding company that transacts a majority of our business through operating subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and meet our debt payment obligations is largely dependent on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. Applicable insurance laws restrict the ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. Applicable insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus.\n\nInsurance regulators have broad powers to prevent reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends of the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted to be made by our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by our regulated insurance subsidiaries may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect.\n\n17\n\n\nInvestment Regulation\n\nLIC is subject to New York’s insurance laws and MIC is subject to Delaware and California’s laws regarding the composition of their investments. Those laws generally require diversification of their investment portfolios and limits on the amount of their investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require those companies to sell those investments. \n\nLicensing of Our Employees and Adjusters\n\nIn most states in which we operate, insurance claims adjusters are required to be licensed and some must fulfill annual continuing education requirements. In most instances, our employees who are negotiating coverage terms are underwriters and are not required to be licensed agents. As of December 31, 2024, 422 employees were required to maintain and did maintain requisite licenses for these activities in most states in which we operate.\n\nEnterprise Risk, Cybersecurity, and Other Recent Developments\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of U.S. state insurance regulators to monitor U.S. insurance holding company groups. Among other things, the NAIC’s model, when adopted, requires the ultimate controlling person of an insurance company to submit an annual enterprise risk management report that describes the risk that an activity, circumstance, event, or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer will, if not remedied promptly, be likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Recently, the NAIC has developed model laws requiring annual reports concerning the nature of corporate governance within an insurance holding company.\n\nIn 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act (the “ORSA Model Act”) to require domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and the insurance group of which it is a member. When the ORSA Model Act is adopted by a particular state, it imposes more extensive filing requirements on parents and affiliates of domestic insurers. Delaware has adopted its version of the ORSA Model Act and New York has implemented portions of the ORSA Model Act.\n\nIn the course of our business, we collect and maintain confidential and personal information. As a result, we are subject to U.S. federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations that, among other things, require that we institute and maintain certain policies and procedures to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure. For example, in 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS\") adopted a broad cybersecurity regulation that requires financial services institutions to, among other things, implement and maintain a cybersecurity program and a cybersecurity policy that will be monitored and tested periodically, develop controls and technology standards for data protection, meet minimum standards in response to any cybersecurity breach and annually certify their compliance with the regulation. On November 1, 2023, the NYDFS issued a significant amendment to the cybersecurity requirements, mandating covered entities to adopt specific standards and controls to secure sensitive data. The recent amendment significantly expands obligations on entities regulated by NYDFS to report cybersecurity incidents and enhance their consumer data protection and cybersecurity infrastructure. Regulated entities are generally required to comply with the new requirements imposed by the Amendment in phases throughout 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which established standards for data security and for the investigation and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. Many states have enacted the Insurance Data Security Model Law or similar laws, and we expect more states to follow.\n\n18\n\n\nAdditionally, a growing set of privacy regulations have created intense scrutiny regarding Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, academics, and commercial interests in the United States and abroad that focus on consumer data protection and privacy. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information about consumers’ online browsing and mobile app usage activity. It is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions, and the applicable choices we offer consumers.\n\nCalifornia has enacted legislation restricting the use of automated systems to communicate with people online. California enacted a statute making it unlawful for any person to use a bot to communicate with another person in California online with the intent to mislead the other person about its artificial identity for the purpose of knowingly deceiving the person about the content of the communication in order to incentivize a purchase or sale of goods or services in a commercial transaction. The statute provides that a person using a bot will not be liable under the statute if the person discloses that it is a bot. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — New legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.”\n\nGDPR\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679 (the “E.U. GDPR”) applies to our activities to the extent that those activities take place in the context of our establishments in the European Union, and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the “UK GDPR”) applies to our activities to the extent that those activities take place in the context of our establishments in the UK (EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the  “GDPR”). In addition, the GDPR may apply to our activities that involve the processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union or UK to whom we offer our products or services. The GDPR could also apply to our business if we were to monitor the activities of individuals in the European Union or UK. As we expand into Europe or UK, the compliance obligations under the GDPR (as set out above) will become more significant. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks as we continue to expand into Europe and the UK. in connection with the GDPR, UK GDPR and other data protection regulations.”\n\nFederal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes\n\nA number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program.\n\nCredit for Reinsurance\n\nState insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws. There are several different ways in which the credit for reinsurance laws may be satisfied by an assuming reinsurer, including being licensed in the state, being accredited in the state, or maintaining certain types of qualifying collateral. We ensure that LIC and MIC are able to take full financial statement credit for their reinsurance.\n\n19\n\n\nInsolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools, and Insurance Facilities\n\nMost states require admitted property and casualty insurance companies to become members of insolvency funds or associations which generally protect customers against the insolvency of the admitted insurance companies. Members of the fund or association must contribute to the payment of certain claims made against insolvent insurance companies through annual assessments. The annual assessments required in any one year will vary from state to state, and are subject to various maximum assessments per line of insurance.\n\nRisk-Based Capital\n\nRisk-based capital laws are designed to assess the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations and to ensure that it has an acceptably low expectation of becoming financially impaired. State insurance regulators use risk-based capital ratios to set capital requirements, considering the size and degree of risk taken by the insurer and taking into account various risk factors including asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk, and interest rate risk. As the ratio of an insurer’s total adjusted capital and surplus decreases relative to its risk-based capital, the risk-based capital laws provide for increasing levels of regulatory intervention culminating with mandatory control of the operations of the insurer by the domiciliary insurance department at the so-called mandatory control level. Our regulators in New York, Delaware and California require annual reporting to confirm that LIC and MIC hold in excess of the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for their operations. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. Failure to maintain risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of LIC and MIC to maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to conduct their businesses. As of December 31, 2024, LIC maintained a risk-based capital level of 577% and MIC maintained a risk-based capital level of 525%.\n\nIRIS Ratios\n\nThe NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) is a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS consists of two phases: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements. The statistical phase highlights those insurers that merit the highest priority in the allocation of the state insurance regulators’ resources. The ratios are not, in themselves, indicative of adverse financial conditions. The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios, and other automated solvency tools. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios for any number of reasons and a ratio falling outside the prescribed \"usual range\" is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. The primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention.\n\nStatutory Accounting Principles\n\nStatutory accounting principles (“SAP”) is a basis of accounting developed by U.S. insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer’s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to customers. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles and related regulations determine, among other things, the amounts our regulated insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as dividends and differ somewhat from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which are designed to measure a business on a going-concern basis. GAAP gives consideration to matching of revenue and expenses and, as a result, certain expenses are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. The valuation of assets and liabilities under GAAP is based in part on best estimate assumptions made by the insurer. Stockholders’ equity represents both amounts currently available and amounts expected to emerge over the life of the business. As a result, the values for assets, liabilities, and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP may be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.\n\n20\n\n\nRate Regulation\n\nNearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.\n\nThe speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. \n\nAn insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is dependent on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.\n\nFrom time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates.\n\nEuropean Regulation\n\nOur European insurance entities consist of Lemonade Insurance N.V., Lemonade Agency B.V., their respective UK branch undertakings, and Lemonade B.V.. We also establish and maintain an entity for the provision of intercompany support services; Lemonade Technology B.V.. Lemonade Insurance N.V. is a licensed non-life insurer established in the Netherlands and is subject to key financial rules and regulations including the Second European Solvency Directive 2009/138/EC (as amended, the “Solvency II Directive”); Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (as amended, the “Delegated Regulation”, together with the Solvency II Directive referred to as the “Solvency II Regulations”); the implementing technical standards and regulatory technical standards issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”); the European Insurance Distribution Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/97, “IDD”); the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht, “DFSA”) and the lower rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (\"IFRS EU\"); and national regulations, as well as local conduct of business requirements, in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Currently, the European Commission is preparing for a review of the Solvency II Directive. Lemonade Agency B.V. is subject to the IDD, the DFSA and national regulations, as well as local business conduct requirements and consumer laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Lemonade B.V. is an insurance holding company within the meaning of article 212 of the Solvency II Directive, as implemented in article 1:1 DFSA.\n\nSince 2022, Lemonade has operated in the UK market and is therefore also subject to relevant UK regulation including the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), the Insurance Act 2015, and relevant subsidiary regulations. By virtue of its authorisation and oversight by both the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) in the UK, Lemonade is also subject to the regulatory requirements of the PRA Rulebook and the FCA Handbook respectively as they pertain to Insurers, distributing agents and financial service providers generally.\n\n21\n\n\nThe Solvency II Regulations\n\nThe Solvency II Directive, as implemented in the DFSA and other national regulations, such as the German Insurance Supervisory Act (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz), prescribes uniform rules for insurers and their activities and services. More specifically, the Solvency II Directive provides rules and regulations relating to, inter alia, Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s authorization requirements (including the European “passport” regime), its minimum own funds and solvency and its governance. Governance requirements include the need to ensure sound business operations, implement mandatory key functions (including Actuarial, Compliance, Internal Audit and Risk) and requirements relating to Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s Management Board members, Supervisory Board Members and other key personnel. The Delegated Regulation is promulgated under the Solvency II Directive and provides detailed requirements relating to some of the Solvency II Directive’s broader requirements.\n\nIDD and other conduct of business rules\n\nThe IDD provides a harmonized regime for insurance distribution activities. It regulates the way insurance products are designed and sold both by insurance intermediaries (e.g. Lemonade Agency B.V.) and directly by insurance undertakings (e.g. Lemonade Insurance N.V.). The rules and regulations set out in the IDD have been implemented in the DFSA. The provisions set out in the IDD mainly relate to standards of product disclosure, promotional materials and product governance and oversight. Local regulations and conduct of business rules implemented in each of the European member states in which both Lemonade Agency B.V. and Lemonade Insurance N.V. do business supplement the requirements set out in the IDD.\n\nFinancial and other Regulators\n\nLemonade Insurance N.V. is subject to primary supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, “DNB”) as the supervisory authority of its home member state. In addition, it is subject to supervision by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, “AFM”). The AFM is the regulator tasked with conduct supervision relating to Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s Dutch activities. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, “BaFin”), as the supervisory authority of a host member state. BaFin is the competent regulator tasked with the supervision of Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s compliance with German regulations and conduct requirements. The French Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, \"ACPR\", which is charged with preserving the stability of the financial system and protecting the customers, insurance policyholders, members and beneficiaries of the persons that it supervises, and Organisme pour le Registre des Intermédiaires en Assurance, \"ORIAS\", an association under the supervision of the Treasury Department in France and in charge of approving insurance intermediaries operating on the French market; the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority in charge of prudentially regulating and supervising financial services firms operating in the UK; the British Financial Conduct Authority, whose role includes protecting consumers, keeping the industry stable, and promoting healthy competition between financial service providers.\n\nLemonade Agency B.V. is subject to supervision by the AFM. Lemonade B.V., as parent, and Lemonade Insurance N.V., as subsidiary, is an E.U. sub-group within the meaning of Article 213(2)(b) of Solvency II, as implemented in article 3:285 (2) DFSA. Lemonade B.V. is subject to group supervision by DNB under the Solvency II Directive. The relevant EU supervisory body for insurers, EIOPA, has limited supervisory powers in the Netherlands, however it plays an important role in drafting and issuing technical standards and preparing guidance relating to various European directives and regulations. EIOPA aims to accomplish efficient and harmonized financial supervision across the European Union.\n\nDNB and AFM employ a risk-based and proportionate approach to supervision, comprising a firm systemic framework, which focuses on the continuous assessment of how firms manage the risks they create and identifying the root causes of risk. DNB regularly pro-actively contacts insurers to discuss matters of strategy, day-to-day operations and the current (and expected future) financial standing of the undertaking, in order to assess what parts of a regulated undertaking, if any, which could pose systemic risks. In addition, DNB monitors operations and business through monthly updates, the submission of Quantitative Reporting Templates, by reviewing annual reports, approving prospective Management Board and Supervisory Board members prior to their appointment and through scheduled and unannounced audits.\n\n22\n\n\nDNB also regulates the acquisition and increase of control over certain authorized firms, including insurers. Under the DFSA, any person intending to acquire control of, or increase (or decrease) control over, an insurer must first obtain the consent of the DNB. In considering whether to grant or withhold its approval for the acquisition of control, DNB must be satisfied that the acquirer is a fit and proper person and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by their acquisition of, or increase in, control. A person will be treated as increasing (or decreasing) their control over an insurer if the level of their percentage of (indirect) shareholding or voting power in the insurer crosses the 10, 20, 33, 50 percent or 100 percent thresholds.\n\nBoth Lemonade Insurance N.V. and Lemonade Agency B.V. commenced operations in the UK under the Temporary Permission Regime in accordance with which certain European Economic Area based firms may continue to operate in the UK for a limited period following the UK's departure from the European Union. During 2023, the UK branch establishments of Lemonade Insurance N.V., and Lemonade Agency B.V. (“UK branch establishments”) received a third country branch authorization in the UK allowing both companies to continue to operate in the UK market on a permanent basis. Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch (BR024862) is the UK establishment of Lemonade Agency B.V.. Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK branch (BR025196), is the UK establishment of Lemonade Insurance N.V.. See Required Licensing section below for a description.\n\nEnforcement\n\nDNB and AFM expect firms to avoid actions that jeopardize compliance with their statutory objectives and applicable rules and regulations and have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated firm. When DNB is concerned that an insurer may present a risk, this may lead to negative consequences, including the requirement to maintain a higher level of regulatory capital (via capital “add-ons” under the Solvency II Directive) to match the higher perceived risks and enforcement action where the risks identified breach applicable rules and regulations. In case of a breach of our license requirements or obligations arising from the applicable rules and regulations, although both DNB and AFM must apply the principle of proportionality in all of their actions, the regulators have a large amount of discretion in determining what measures to impose, if any, in order to address, remedy, or sanction the breach. DNB and the AFM have a large amount of enforcement tools at their disposal to sanction breaches of applicable rules and regulations, including public formal warnings, orders to adopt a certain course of conduct, incremental penalties, and administrative fines. In addition, breaches may lead to a revocation of an undertaking license and, in the case of insurers, where the breach relates to material prudential shortcomings, DNB may impose emergency measures, including the appointment of an administrator or the imposition of measures aimed at winding-up the undertaking).\n\nRequired Licensing\n\nOur subsidiary Lemonade Insurance N.V. is licensed and supervised by the insurance supervision division of DNB as a Solvency II non-life insurance company. DNB, as the supervisory authority of its home member state, has permitted us to sell in other European countries, such as Germany and France, on a Freedom of Services basis. In general, in addition to continuing to meet the threshold conditions to authorization, Lemonade Insurance N.V. and Lemonade Agency B.V. are obliged to comply with European regulations, European directives (in as far as these directives have direct effect in the Netherlands or other European member states in which our subsidiaries do business), the DFSA and the lower regulations set out thereunder, and other national regulations, all of which contain detailed rules covering, among other things, systems and controls, conduct of business, and prudential (i.e. capital and solvency) requirements.\n\nLemonade Insurance N.V. launched its first product in the UK market in October 2022, and operates in the UK through its registered branch establishment, Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch (BR025196) which received third-country branch authorization from the Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK in May 2023. This allows the company to operate in the UK market permanently. Lemonade Insurance N.V. is licensed as an insurance company by De Nederlandsche Bank in the Netherlands (R162036). Authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority. Subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority and limited regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (FRN 846181).\n\nLemonade Agency B.V. commenced operations in the UK under the TPR as described above, and received third country branch authorisation through its registered branch establishment Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch (BR024862) in 2023. Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN: 989294).\n\n23\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOur internet website address is www.lemonade.com.

Risk Factors\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\nWe have not been profitable since our inception in 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $1,298.8 million and $1,096.6 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of $202.2 million and $236.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We expect to make significant investments to further develop and expand our business. In particular, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on marketing and advertising as part of our strategy to increase our customer base. The marketing and advertising expenses that we incur are typically expensed immediately while any revenues that they generate are recognized ratably over the 12-month term of each insurance policy that we write. This timing difference can therefore result in expenses that exceed the related revenue generated in any given year. As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We expect that our net loss will increase in the near term as we continue to make such investments to grow our business. Despite these investments, we may not succeed in increasing our revenue on the timeline that we expect or in an amount sufficient to lower our net loss and ultimately become profitable. Moreover, if our revenue declines, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner because many of our costs are fixed in the short term. In addition, if we reduce variable costs to respond to losses, this may limit our ability to sign up new customers and grow our revenues. Accordingly, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\n\nOur success and ability to grow our business depend on retaining and expanding our customer base. If we fail to add new customers or retain current customers, our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\n\nWe have experienced significant customer growth since we commenced operations; however, we may not be able to maintain this growth and thus, our customer base could stop growing or even shrink over time.\n\nOur ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers depends, in large part, on our ability to continue to be perceived as providing delightful and superior insurance-buying and claims- filing customer experiences, competitive pricing, and adequate insurance coverage. In order to maintain this perception, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and advertising expenses, costs related to improving our service, and lower margins in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers. If we fail to remain competitive on customer experience, pricing, and insurance coverage options, our ability to grow our business and generate revenue by attracting and retaining customers may be adversely affected.\n\nThere are many factors that could negatively affect our ability to grow our customer base, including if:\n\n•we fail to effectively use search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content- based online advertising, and other online sources for generating traffic to our website and our online app;\n\n•potential customers in a particular marketplace or generally do not meet our underwriting guidelines;\n\n•our competitors mimic our digital platform, causing current and potential customers to purchase their insurance products instead of our products;\n\n•our digital platform experiences disruptions;\n\n•we experience unfavorable shifts in customer perception of our chat-bots;\n\n•we suffer reputational harm to our brand resulting from negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate;\n\n•we fail to expand geographically;\n\n•we fail to offer new and competitive products;\n\n•customers have difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing our app or website on mobile devices or web browsers as a result of actions by us or third parties;\n\n•technical or other problems frustrate the customer experience, particularly if those problems prevent us from generating quotes or paying claims in a fast and reliable manner; or\n\n25\n\n\n•we are unable to address customer concerns regarding the content, privacy, and security of our digital platform.\n\nOur inability to overcome these challenges could impair our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe \"Lemonade\" brand may not become as widely known as incumbents' brands or the brand may become tarnished.\n\nMany of our competitors have brands that are well recognized. As a relatively new entrant into the insurance market, we spend considerable money and other resources to create brand awareness and build our reputation. We may not be able to build brand awareness, and our efforts at building, maintaining and enhancing our reputation could fail. Complaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to consumers or business partners, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, whether valid or not, could diminish confidence in our brand, which could adversely affect our reputation and business. As we expand our product offerings and enter new markets, we need to establish our reputation with new customers, and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets could be adversely affected. We may not be able to maintain or enhance our reputation, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nDenial of claims or our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the efficacy of our artificial intelligence claims processing, the training and experience of our claims adjusters, including our third-party claims administrators, and our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions.\n\nThe speed by which our artificial intelligence technology allows us to process and pay claims is a differentiating factor for our business and an increase in the average time to process claims could undermine our reputation and position in the insurance marketplace. Any failure to pay claims accurately or timely could also lead to regulatory and administrative actions or material litigation, or result in damage to our reputation, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIf our claims adjusters or third party claims administrators are unable to effectively process our volume of non-automated claims, our ability to grow our business while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction could be compromised, which in turn, could adversely affect our operating margins.\n\nOur future revenue growth and prospects depend on attaining greater value from each customer.\n\nOur future growth and prospects depend on our ability to increase the premium per customer, as described in the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Currently, the large majority of our customers are renters. In order to increase our premium per customer, we must increase the number of higher-priced customers, such as homeowners, and the proportion of higher-priced customers relative to lower-priced customers, such as renters. Our business model is premised on the expectation that a significant number of our customers that are renters will continue to retain coverage with us as they move from being renters to homeowners. Currently, however, given our limited operating history, substantially all of our current homeowner users are new customers who were not previously renters with us. The purchase of a home is a significant event in a person's life and we cannot provide assurances that we will succeed in retaining existing customers that are renters as they become homeowners. This may occur for a variety of factors. For example, at the time a renter purchases a home, he or she is exposed to a large number of service providers who have direct and personal access to that renter in a way that we do not. Those service providers may have, and share, their own views and preferences for homeowners insurance. Furthermore, given the expenditure involved in a home purchasing decision, differences in price between our insurance product and that of our competitors may appear less significant. In addition, there may even be a perception that a higher priced policy from a traditional brand name insurer may be of higher quality when coupled with the size and longevity of such traditional insurers. A failure to \n\n26\n\n\nretain renters as they transition to homeowner status may materially adversely impact our future growth and prospects. Moreover, we also sell homeowner policies directly, or indirectly through independent insurance agencies, to customers who did not previously have a renters policy with us. To the extent we are unable to sell homeowner policies directly or via our insurance agency partners to new customers either now or in the future, our ability to increase our premium per customer would be negatively impacted, which could materially adversely impact our future growth and prospects.\n\nThe novelty of our business model makes its efficacy unpredictable and susceptible to unintended consequences.\n\nOur business model is predicated on behavioral economics. Under our model, excess premiums can be donated to nonprofits selected by our customers as part of our annual 'Giveback'. We designed our business model to attract customers, align our incentives with those customers, discourage fraudulent claims and allow us to offer competitive pricing, but it may not operate as intended over time and on a larger scale. For example:\n\n•Our commitment to charitable giving through our Giveback program may not align our interests with those of our customers or prospective customers to the extent anticipated. Moreover, our commitment to charitable giving may not resonate with our existing customers or may fail to attract new customers.\n\n•The amount contributed to nonprofits may be viewed as insufficient by existing or new customers. Furthermore, there may be insufficient money remaining after paying claims to make charitable contributions.\n\n•See \"Business — Our Vertically-Integrated Platform — Reinsurance.\" False claims or higher than expected claims could cause reinsurers to charge higher rates, refuse to provide reinsurance or provide reinsurance on less favorable terms. The control procedures we have implemented to detect false claims, may not prevent such claims from being filed or prevent a sufficient number of them from being paid out.\n\nThe failure of our business model to function as intended could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur Giveback is a cornerstone of our business model that, when coupled with our fixed fee, works to align our interests with those of our customers, which we believe builds trust, minimizes fraud, and keeps our costs down. If a state, federal authority or foreign jurisdiction was to find that the Giveback was a rebate rather than a charitable contribution, or impermissible on other grounds, we may not be able to donate the residual value of our customers' premiums to nonprofits in certain, or any, of the states or foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. If even one regulator were to disallow the Giveback, it could force us to abandon the Giveback in part or entirely, either of which could undermine the behavioral economics foundation on which our business model is based, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our brand, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, we could modify, reduce or eliminate the Giveback at our discretion for a variety of reasons. LIC's board of directors may determine the amount and distribution of the Giveback by taking into consideration various factors such as the current goodwill and reputation of the nonprofit selected by customers, the amount of funds available for distribution by each cohort, the reasonableness of such contribution, and general shareholders' interests, such as the proposed amount and distribution of the Giveback against factors like overall shareholder returns, our financial and operating performance, and our social responsibility and the benefits shareholders and their communities receive from proposed contributions. Before determining the amount of the Giveback, LIC‘s board of directors may also analyze the extent of our reinsurance coverage and management's expectations with respect to such reinsurance coverage for the upcoming fiscal year, particularly as it relates to the amount of capital and surplus required to continue to operate successfully. If after weighing any of these factors, LIC's board of directors were to reduce or eliminate the Giveback, our business model would be impacted, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our brand, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n27\n\n\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance, implementation of our business model, and our future prospects.\n\nWe launched our business to sell renters and homeowners insurance in late 2016 and have a limited operating history. Due to our limited operating history and the rapid growth we have experienced since we began operations, our operating results are hard to predict, and our historical results may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our future results. In addition, we have limited data to validate key aspects of our business model. For example, our customer base is made up primarily of renters and we have very few instances of those renters becoming homeowners, a key element of our business model. It is also difficult for us to track that data and the data that we collect may not provide useful measures for evaluating our business model. Our inability to adequately assess our performance and growth could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\n\nOur revenue grew from $256.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $429.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $526.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our rapid growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure has become and will continue to become more complex to the extent that we add staff, and we will continue to enhance our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to the insurance buying experience for the customer. If we cannot manage our growth effectively to maintain the quality and efficiency of our customers' insurance- buying experience, as well as their experience as ongoing customers, our business could be harmed as a result, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIntense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to attain or increase profitability.\n\nThe renters, homeowners (including buildings and content), pet, life and car insurance market is highly competitive with carriers competing through product coverage, reputation, financial strength, advertising, price, customer service and distribution.\n\nWhile we face limited direct competition from traditional insurance companies for first-time renters, we face significant competition from traditional insurance companies for homeowners, car and life. Competitors include companies such as Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, GEICO, Progressive and Travelers. These companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, higher financial ratings, greater resources, and additional access to capital. Our future growth will depend in large part on our ability to grow our homeowners insurance business in which traditional insurance companies retain certain advantages. In particular, unlike us, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase renters, homeowners and multiple other types of insurance coverage and \"bundle\" them together into one policy and, in certain circumstances, include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, we could face intense competition from insurance companies that are already established in such markets. Competitors in the pet insurance space include companies such as Nationwide, Embrace, and Trupanion. Competitors in the car insurance space include companies such as Progressive, GEICO and Allstate. Additionally, any new insurance products could take months to be approved by regulatory authorities, or may not be approved at all.\n\nWe currently face competition by technology companies in the markets in which we operate. There are various technology companies that have recently started operating in adjacent insurance categories that may in the future offer renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance products. Technology companies may in the future begin operating and offering products at better and more competitive pricing than us, which could cause our results of operations and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, traditional insurance companies may seek to adapt their businesses to sell insurance and process claims using technology similar to ours. Given their size, resources, and other competitive advantages, they may be able to erode any market advantage we may currently have over them.\n\n28\n\n\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nReinsurance is a contract by which an insurer, which may be referred to as the ceding insurer, agrees with a second insurer, called a reinsurer, that the reinsurer will cover a portion of the losses incurred by the ceding insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the ceding insurer, in exchange for a premium. Our insurance subsidiaries, LIC and MIC, obtain reinsurance to help manage their exposure to property and casualty insurance risks. Although our reinsurance counterparties are liable to us according to the terms of the reinsurance policies, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of our reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations, that the reinsurers will not pay in a timely fashion, or that our losses are so large that they exceed the limits inherent in our reinsurance contracts, limiting recovery. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years, in which case we may have no legal ability to recover what is due to us under our agreement with such reinsurer. Any disputes with reinsurers regarding coverage under reinsurance contracts could be time consuming, costly, and uncertain of success.\n\nUnder the Proportional Reinsurance Contracts, which span all of our products and geographies, we transfer, or “cede,” a specified percentage of our premiums to our reinsurers. In exchange, these reinsurers pay us a “ceding commission” on all premiums ceded to the Reinsurers, in addition to funding the corresponding claims, subject to certain limitations. We have also opted to manage the remaining portion of our business with alternative forms of reinsurance through the Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts. Our business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes which are inherently unpredictable. On July 1, 2024, we entered into a one year property catastrophe excess of loss treaty. If we are unable to renegotiate, at the same or more favorable terms, the Proportional Reinsurance Contracts or the Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts when each expires, such changes could have an adverse impact on our business model.\n\nWe may change the structure of our reinsurance arrangement in the future, which may impact our overall risk profile and financial and capital condition. We may be unable to negotiate a new reinsurance contract to provide continuous coverage or negotiate reinsurance on the same terms and rates as are currently available, as such availability depends in part on factors outside of our control. A new contract may not provide sufficient reinsurance protection. Market forces and external factors, such as significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks or an increase in capital requirements, impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance, extend our reinsurance contracts or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient at acceptable prices, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure, reduce our insurance writings or develop or seek other alternatives.\n\nThe unavailability of acceptable reinsurance cover would have an adverse impact on our business model, which depends on reinsurance companies to absorb any unfavorable variance from the level of losses anticipated at underwriting. If we are unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, we would have to increase our risk exposure or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, each of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business volume and profitability. Alternatively, we could elect to pay higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon our profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in most cases subject to approval by state regulators, to offset this additional cost. Moreover, if adequate reinsurance cannot be obtained or maintained at reasonable rates, we may be unable to make contributions to the nonprofit organizations selected by our customers as part of our Giveback, which could erode customer trust, damage our brand, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n29\n\n\nFailure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.\n\nWe must have sufficient capital to comply with insurance regulatory requirements and maintain authority to conduct our business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") has developed a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital of U.S.-based insurers, known as risk-based capital that all states have adopted. This system establishes the minimum amount of capital necessary for an insurance company to support its overall business operations. It identifies insurers, including property-casualty insurers, that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurer's assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Moreover, as a new entrant to the insurance industry, we may face additional capital requirements as compared to those of our larger and more established competitors. Failure to maintain adequate risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct its business. See \"Regulation — Risk-Based Capital.\"\n\nIf we are unable to maintain and implement relationships with third-party service providers, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties are adversely impacted by financial, reputational, regulatory and other risks, our prospects for future growth and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nSome parts of our business depend on our relationships and contractual arrangements with third parties. If our third parties terminate business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, we may fail to meet our business objectives and targets, and our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, our life insurance product is offered through an arrangement with a life insurance provider. In these relationships, we rely on the third-party’s internal controls, to manage the product. Our monitoring efforts of the third party provider’s and other service providers may not be adequate, or our providers could exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, which could result in operational disruption, reputational damage and regulatory intervention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Furthermore, these third parties are subject to many of the same risks that we face, including those related to cybersecurity and fraudulent claims.  These parties also experience intense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which they operate. They may be acquired or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing or eliminating their business with us.  If we are unsuccessful in our ability to maintain successful relationships with these third-party service providers and implement our arrangements with them for any of these reasons, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we are unable to expand our product offerings, or expand into new markets, our prospects for future growth may be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and therefore increase our revenue depends on our ability to successfully expand our product offerings into new markets. In 2020, we launched pet insurance and in 2021 we launched our life and car insurance products to add to our renters and homeowners insurance offerings, and in 2024, we expanded our offerings in the UK and France to include Buildings insurance. Our success in the renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance markets depend on our deep understanding of each market and associated business challenges faced by participants in them. Developing this level of understanding of the newer markets we have entered may require substantial investments of time and resources, and we may not be successful. In addition to the need for substantial resources, insurance regulation could limit our ability to introduce new product offerings or the states in which we offer them. Additionally, any new insurance products could take months to be approved by regulatory authorities, or may not be approved at all. If our products are not competitive in current markets or we do not penetrate new markets successfully, our revenue may grow at a slower rate than we anticipate and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our decision to expand our insurance product offerings beyond the renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance market would subject us to additional regulatory requirements specific to such insurance products, which, in turn, could require us to incur additional costs or devote additional resources to compliance.\n\n30\n\n\nOur proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to, which could cause us to write policies we should not write, price those policies inappropriately or overpay claims that are made by our customers.\n\nWe utilize the data gathered from the insurance application process to determine whether or not to write a particular policy and, if so, how to price that particular policy. Similarly, we use proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms to process many of our claims. The data that we gather through our interactions with our customers is evaluated and curated by proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms. The continuous development, maintenance and operation of our deep-learning backend data analytics engine is expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties including material performance problems, undetected defects or errors, for example, with new capabilities incorporating artificial intelligence. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary algorithms from operating properly. If our data analytics do not function reliably, we may incorrectly price insurance products for our customers or incorrectly pay or deny claims made by our customers. Either of these situations could result in customer dissatisfaction with us, which could cause customers to cancel their insurance policies with us, prevent prospective customers from obtaining new insurance policies, or cause us to underprice policies or overpay claims. Such situations may also result in fines and monetary penalties as well as regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action.\n\nRegulators may limit our ability to develop or implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms, and to maintain the confidentiality of this technology. Changes to existing regulations, their interpretation or implementation, or new regulations could impede our use of this technology, or require that we disclose our proprietary technology to our competitors, which could impair our competitive position and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nExisting and new legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nState and federal lawmakers, and insurance regulators are focusing upon the use of AI broadly, including concerns about transparency, deception, and fairness in particular. Changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, specific to the use of AI, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. In addition, our business and operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local consumer protection laws, including laws which place restrictions on the use of automated and non-automated tools and technologies to communicate with wireless telephone subscribers or consumers generally.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender.  In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) places restrictions on making outbound calls, faxes, and SMS text messages to consumers using certain types of automated or prerecorded technology or that involve marketing.  Among other restrictions under the TCPA, with respect to phone calls and text messages, prior express consent, and in the case of certain marketing messages, prior express written consent, of consumers may be required before sending certain outbound calls or text messages. We could face allegations that we have violated the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act, or similar laws, rules and regulations, and even if these allegations are without merit, we could face regulatory inquiries, lawsuits and related defense costs, liability (such as fines, damages, consent decrees, and injunctions), harm to our reputation and other losses that could harm our business.\n\n31\n\n\nA California law, effective as of July 2019, makes it unlawful for any person to use a bot to communicate with a person in California online with the intent to mislead the other person about its artificial identity for the purpose of knowingly deceiving the person about the content of the communication in order to incentivize a purchase of goods or services in a commercial transaction. Although we have taken steps to mitigate our liability for violations of this and other laws restricting the use of electronic communication tools, no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to civil litigation or regulatory enforcement. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the ways in which we communicate with prospective or current customers before or during onboarding, customer care, or claims management, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in our customer acquisition and retention, reducing the growth prospects of our business, and adversely affecting our financial condition and future cash flows.\n\nWe rely on artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes, and any legal or regulatory requirements that prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data could thus materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe use artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes. If federal, state or international regulators or courts were to determine that the type of data we collect, the process we use for collecting this data or how we use it unfairly discriminates against or otherwise violates the rights of some groups of people, laws and regulations could be interpreted or implemented to prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data.\n\nState legislatures and insurance regulators have also shown interest in the use of external data and artificial intelligence in insurance practices, including underwriting, marketing and claims practices. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted its Artificial Intelligence Principles in August 2020, a model bulletin titled “Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers,” and a number of states have had legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to the use of external data and artificial intelligence in the insurance industry, including bulletins issued in 2022 by the California and Connecticut Departments of Insurance, and more recently in July 2024 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, advising insurers of their obligations related to unfair discrimination when using big data and artificial intelligence.\n\nDue to Proposition 103 in California, our largest market for car insurance, we are currently limited in our ability to use telematics data beyond miles-driven to underwrite insurance, including data on how the car is driven. This could hinder our ability to accurately assess the risks that we underwrite in other states if they were to pass similar laws or regulations. In three other states where we currently operate, we do not use behavioral telematics data because it is either (a) permitted, but we opted out given uncertainty regarding the impact such data would have on pricing, or (b) it is voluntary (meaning the policyholder has to opt in). As we aim to be a fully national provider of insurance across 50 states and Washington, D.C. in the future, we will need to comply with the rules and regulations of each market. At this time, we do not know which of our target markets prohibit, permit with conditions, or fully permit the use of behavioral telematics to set premiums, and if permitted, if this will be of benefit to us in pricing. While we are currently in discussions with regulators to allow the use of telematics to a greater extent to underwrite and price insurance policies, we cannot predict the outcome of these discussions, and there can be no assurance that state regulators will revise regulations accordingly, if at all, nor that current permissive states will further restrict the use of such data. Although there is currently limited federal and state legislation outside of California restricting our ability to collect driving behavior data, private organizations are implementing principles and guidelines to protect driver privacy. Some state regulators have expressed interest in the use of external data sources, algorithms and/or predictive models in insurance underwriting or rating. Specifically, regulators have raised questions about the potential for unfair discrimination, disparate impact, and lack of transparency associated with the use of external consumer data. Regulators may also require us to disclose the external data we use, algorithms and/or predictive matters prior to approving our underwriting models and rates. Such disclosures could put our intellectual property at risk.\n\n32\n\n\nAdditionally, existing laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”, collectively “CCPA”), future laws, and evolving attitudes about privacy protection may impair our ability to collect, use, and maintain data points of sufficient type or quantity to develop and train our artificial intelligence algorithms. If such laws or regulations were enacted federally or in a large number of states in which we operate, it could impact the integrity and quality of our pricing and underwriting processes.\n\nThere is also increasing focus on regulating the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Europe. In 2023, the European Union legislators reached a political agreement on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for artificial intelligence in the EU market. The EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply by 2026. The EU AI Act will apply to companies like ours that develop, use and/ or provide artificial intelligence in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose artificial intelligence and foundation models, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover for the most serious compliance failures. In addition, the revised EU Product Liability Directive came into force in December 2024, to be implemented into EU Member State national law by December 2026. This Directive extends the EU’s existing strict product liability regime to artificial intelligence technologies and artificial intelligence -enabled products and facilitates civil claims in respect of harm caused by artificial intelligence and there are further legislative proposals to regulate AI. With these developments, legislation relating to artificial intelligence including the EU AI Act has a material impact on the way artificial intelligence is regulated in the EU, and together with developing guidance and/ or decisions in this area, is likely to affect our use of artificial intelligence and our ability to provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\nWe depend on search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content-based online advertising and other online sources to attract consumers to our website and our online app, which may be affected by third-party interference beyond our control.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract consumers to our website and our online app and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. We depend, in large part, on search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content-based online advertising and other online sources for traffic to our website and our online app.\n\nWith respect to search engines, we are included in search results as a result of both paid search listings, where we purchase specific search terms that result in the inclusion of our advertisement, and free search listings, which depend on algorithms used by search engines. For paid search listings, if one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose consumers and traffic to our website could decrease, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For free search listings, if search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, our websites may appear less prominently or not at all in search results, which could result in reduced traffic to our websites.\n\nOur ability to maintain and increase the number of consumers directed to our products from digital platforms is not within our control. Search engines, social media platforms and other online sources often revise their algorithms and introduce new advertising products. If one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for traffic to our website and our online app were to modify its general methodology for how it displays our advertisements or keyword search results, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our website and our online app, our business and operating results are likely to suffer. In addition, if our online display advertisements are no longer effective or are not able to reach certain consumers due to consumers' use of ad-blocking software, our business and operating results could suffer.\n\n33\n\n\nAdditionally, changes in regulations or commercial practices have limited and will continue to limit the ability of search engines and social media platforms, including, but not limited to, Google and Facebook, to collect data from users and engage in targeted advertising. For example, the proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act would mandate annual disclosure to the SEC of the type and \"aggregate value\" of user data used by harvesting companies, such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Google and Amazon, including how revenue is generated by user data and what measures are taken to protect the data. If the costs of advertising on search engines and social media platforms increase, we may incur additional marketing expenses or be required to allocate a larger portion of our marketing spend to other channels and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Similarly, insurance brokerage and distribution regulation may limit our ability to rely on key distribution platforms, such as the Lemonade API, if the third party distribution platforms are unable to continue to distribute our insurance products pursuant to insurance law and regulations.\n\nThe marketing of our insurance products depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with digital app stores, in particular, those operated by Google and Apple. Furthermore, because many of our customers access our insurance products through an online app, we depend on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our online app. Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our online app, including those relating to the amount of (and requirement to pay) certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by Apple and Google through our online app, to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute online app through their stores, the features we provide and the manner in which we market in-app products. We cannot be certain that Apple or Google will not limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our online app, the features we provide and the manner in which we market our online app. To the extent either or both of them do so, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, one of the factors we use to evaluate our customer satisfaction and market position is our Apple App Store ratings. This rating, however, may not be a reliable indicator of our customer satisfaction relative to other companies who are rated on the Apple App Store since, to date, we have received a fraction of the number of reviews of some of the companies we benchmark against.\n\nWe also attract customers through our relationships with certain business development partners. If our business development partners were to charge higher rates or decide to terminate their relationships with us, our ability to attract customers could be materially impaired. In addition, we have expanded our direct to customer acquisition channels, including subway and taxicab panels. Our efforts to acquire customers through direct marketing may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny by state insurance regulators pursuant to unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices laws.\n\nWe may require additional capital to grow our business, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\nTo the extent that our capital is insufficient at any point in time to meet future operating requirements (including regulatory capital requirements) or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected growth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, the availability of reinsurance, as well as market disruptions and other developments.\n\nHistorically, we have funded our operations, marketing expenditures and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. In addition, the NYDFS, Delaware Department of Insurance (\"DE Dept.\"), California Department of Insurance (\"CDI\"), and other regulatory bodies may not permit additional equity issuances or other forms of financing that we may wish to pursue. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\n\n34\n\n\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and warrants, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Our stockholders may also face dilution as the warrants issued to Chewy Insurance Services, LLC which will vest in installments, in increasing amounts over a period of five years, subject to certain vesting events and thresholds. See Note 16 for more information about the terms of these warrants. Furthermore, any debt financing secured by us in the future could require that a substantial portion of our operating cash flow be devoted to the payment of interest and principal on such indebtedness, which may decrease available funds for other business activities, and could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\n\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, maintain minimum amounts of risk-based capital and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by our sole provider of third-party data centers or our internet service providers could impair the operability of our website and our online app and may cause our business to suffer.\n\nWe currently offer our products through our website and online app using Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") data centers, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, floods, fires, severe storms, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures, and similar events, many of which are beyond our control, any of which could disrupt our services, prevent customers from accessing our products, destroy customer data, or prevent us from being able to continuously back up and record data. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our data centers or related systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to customers or damage to our reputation. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS, and, even if we do switch our operations, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our website and online app. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance, it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our services or products.\n\nAWS enables us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions and provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. Termination of the AWS agreement may harm our ability to access data centers we need to host our website and online app or to do so on terms as favorable as those we have with AWS.\n\nAs we continue to expand the number of customers to whom we provide our products and services, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of AWS data centers or third-party internet service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our website or online app or impede our ability to scale our operations. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our website or online app as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n35\n\n\nSecurity incidents or real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our systems, website or app could impair our operations, result in loss of personal customer information, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur continued success is dependent on our systems, applications, and software continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. We rely on our technology and engineering staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our systems and services in an efficient and secure manner. Like all information systems and technology, our website and online app may contain material errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs, particularly when new features or capabilities are released, and may be subject to computer viruses or malicious code, break-ins, phishing impersonation attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, as well as unintentional incidents causing data leakage, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or website or online app shutdowns, or could cause loss of critical data, or the unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of personal or other confidential information.\n\nIf we experience compromises to our security that result in technology performance, integrity, or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our website or our online app or the loss or unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of confidential information, customers may lose trust and confidence in us, and customers may decrease the use of our website or our online app, or stop using our website or our online app entirely. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or customers' information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often they are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Even if we take steps that we believe are adequate to protect us from cyber threats, hacking against our competitors or other companies could create the perception among our customers or potential customers that our digital platform is not safe to use.\n\nA significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems, software, or services may harm our reputation, impair our ability to operate, retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\nWe are periodically subject to examinations by our primary state insurance regulators, which could result in adverse examination findings and necessitate remedial actions.\n\nWe provide insurance through our subsidiaries, LIC and MIC. Since LIC is a New York State-domiciled insurance company, LIC’s  primary insurance regulator responsible for supervision and examination is the NYDFS. Since MIC is domiciled in Delaware and is commercially domiciled in California, MIC’s primary insurance regulators responsible for supervision and examination are the Delaware Department of Insurance and the California Department of Insurance. LIC and MIC are subject to a financial examination by their primary insurance regulators generally every three to five years, under which they will evaluate the financial condition and identify current and prospective risks of each company by obtaining information about each company including corporate governance, identifying and assessing inherent risks within each company and evaluating system controls and procedures used to mitigate those risks. In 2024, the NYDFS completed a group financial exam of LIC and MIC covering the years 2019 through 2022 for LIC, and 2021 and 2022 for MIC. All required remediation pursuant to the group financial exam was completed in 2024, however, we cannot predict with precision the likelihood, nature, or extent of any necessary remedial actions in any future examinations.\n\nIn addition, insurance regulators of other states in which we are licensed to operate periodically conduct market conduct examinations or other targeted investigations. We are presently subject to, and in the future will continue to be subject to, such examination and investigations. Any regulatory or enforcement action or any regulatory order imposing remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action against us resulting from these examinations or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The results of each examination can give rise to fines and monetary penalties as well as regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action.\n\n36\n\n\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use customer information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data, respect customers' privacy or comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\n\nUse of technology to offer insurance products involves the storage and transmission of information, including personal information, in relation to our staff, contractors, business partners and current, past or potential customers. Security breaches have occurred and may occur again, including by hackers or insiders, could expose confidential information, which could result in potential regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, compliance orders, liability, litigation and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, unauthorized parties could steal or access our users' names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and other information that we collect when providing insurance quotes, and credit card or other payment information if a customer agrees to purchase insurance coverage from us. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or customers' information. Any of these incidents, or any other types of security or privacy related incidents, could result in an investigation by a competent regulator, resulting in a fine or penalty, or an order to implement specific compliance measures. It could also trigger claims by affected third parties. While we use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties designed to effect secure transmission of such information, we cannot guarantee the security of the transfer and storage of personal information.\n\nAny or all of the issues above could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers, or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security, and data breaches.  Such legislation includes the CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, including an obligation to provide certain new disclosures to such residents. Specifically, among other things, the CCPA creates new consumer rights, and imposes corresponding obligations on covered businesses, relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information collected by covered businesses, including California residents' right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain sharing and sales of their personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The law exempts from certain requirements of the CCPA certain information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act, the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act. The definition of \"personal information\" in the CCPA is broad and may encompass other information that we maintain beyond that excluded under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act or the California Financial Information Privacy Act exemption. Further, the CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action increases the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. \n\nAdditionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was recently passed in California and expands the scope of the CCPA and creates new consumer privacy rights for California residents, including rights to correct personal information. Further, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on businesses to implement data retention and minimization practices contractually limit the use of personal information by service providers and contractors, perform cybersecurity audits and risk assessments, and implement reasonable security. The CPRA also permits consumers to opt out of the sharing of personal information for use in behavioral advertising, which may impact our ability to market our products and services. The CPRA also establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is the first data privacy regulator in the U.S., to enforce the CPRA. The CPRA strengthens some of the enforcement authority established under the CCPA and could result in increased enforcement actions and fines. We may incur additional costs associated with compliance efforts leading up to the effective date.\n\nSome observers have noted that the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, and multiple states have enacted, or are expected to enact, similar laws. There is also discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection and privacy law to which we likely would be subject if it is enacted. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.\n\n37\n\n\nAs we continue to expand into Europe and the UK, we may also face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the GDPR and other data protection regulations. The GDPR imposes comprehensive data privacy compliance obligations in relation to our collection, processing, sharing, disclosure, transfer and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data” , including a principal of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way we process data (including by way of our algorithms). In the event of a data breach, we are also subject to breach notification laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including U.S. state laws and the GDPR, and the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, a number of federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy affect and apply to the insurance industry specifically, including those imposed by the NYDFS. See \"Business - Regulation.\"\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, compliance orders, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause customers to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, new and changed rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection (in particular those that impact the use of artificial intelligence) and cross-border transfers of customer information could cause us to delay planned uses and disclosures of data to comply with applicable privacy and data protection requirements. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put personal information at risk, which may result in increased regulatory scrutiny and have a material adverse effect to our reputation, business and operating results.\n\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in our business, and the inability to maintain these licenses, errors in the software we license or the terms of open source licenses could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business relies on certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the risks associated with the use of third-party software cannot be eliminated, and these risks could negatively affect our business.\n\nAdditionally, the software powering our technology systems incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our systems. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code or re-engineer all or a portion of our technology systems, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technology systems. Such risk could be difficult or impossible to eliminate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe may be subject to compliance obligations arising from medical information privacy regulations.\n\nBy processing certain personal injury data on behalf of our clients, we may be subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws specific to the protection of healthcare information. Although we may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and related state laws, we do not have a process in place to assess or align our privacy and security practices specifically against requirements for protecting medical information.\n\n38\n\n\nWe may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks as we continue to expand into Europe and the UK in connection with the GDPR, UK GDPR, and other data protection regulations.\n\nThe GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by our business in the context of our establishments in the European Union and/or the UK. In addition, all portions of our business established outside the European Union may be required to comply with the requirements of the GDPR with respect to the offering of products or services to individuals in the European Union or UK. The GDPR could also apply to our establishments of business outside the European Union if we were to monitor the activities of individuals in the European Union or become established in the European Union/UK. The GDPR increases the maximum level of fines for the most serious compliance failures to the greater of four percent of annual worldwide turnover or €20,000,000/ GBP17,500,000, respectively.\n\nWe may also be subject to the local privacy and data protection laws of the E.U. Member States in which we offer products or services, which can carry penalties and potential criminal sanctions.\n\nThe regulatory requirements and restrictions set out in the GDPR include, among others, the following:\n\n•The GDPR imposes a number of principles with respect to the processing of personal data, including requirements to process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to process personal data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of personal data, limit the retention of personal data for no longer than is necessary, and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We are implementing external and internal policies and procedures, technical measures and internal training designed to adhere to those principles;\n\n•In relation to the transparency principle, the GDPR requires us to provide individuals in the European Union and the U.K. whose personal data we process (\"data subjects\") with certain information regarding the processing of their personal data by us, and we have an E.U. and U.K. privacy policy, which can be found at https://www.lemonade.com/de/en/privacy-policy (with respect to Germany), https://www.lemonade.com/nl/en/privacy-policy (with respect to the Netherlands) and http://www.lemonade.com/fr/en/privacy-policy (with respect to France);  and https://www.lemonade.com/uk/privacy-policy (with respect to UK).\n\n•The GDPR requires us to maintain internal records of our processing activities and to make those records available to regulators on demand;\n\n•The GDPR requires us to include certain mandatory terms in our agreements with third parties that process personal data subject to the GDPR on our behalf (\"Processors\") and we are in the process of entering into compliant data processing terms with each of our Processors. If third parties with whom we work were to violate their obligations under the GDPR, and/or under their agreements with us, such violation could potentially have an adverse impact on our business;\n\n•The GDPR grants data subjects certain rights, including the right to object to the processing of their personal data by us, to request copies of their personal data from us, to receive information regarding the processing of their personal data and to exercise certain other rights against us in respect of their personal data, and we are implementing internal policies and procedures designed to address those rights;\n\n•The GDPR prohibits automated decision making, i.e. a decision evaluating a data subject's personal aspects based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects or other significant effects for that data subject, except where such decision making is necessary for entering into or performing a contract or is based on the data subject's explicit consent. There is not yet any clear precedent as to whether use of artificial intelligence to make insurance offers to individuals will be considered necessary even though it is integral to our business model. If our automated decision making processes cannot meet this necessity threshold, we cannot use these processes with E.U./U.K. data subjects unless we obtain their explicit consent. Relying on consent to conduct this type of processing holds its own risks because consent must be considered freely given (commentators argue that seeking consent by tying it to a service may be problematic) and consent can be withdrawn by a data subject at any time. We are continually monitoring for updates to guidance in this area, however, if subsequent guidance and/or decisions limit our ability to use our artificial intelligence models, that may decrease our operational efficiency and result in an increase to the costs of operating our business. Automated decision making also attracts a higher regulatory burden under the GDPR, which requires the existence of such automated decision making be disclosed to the data subject including a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Further obligations in terms of \n\n39\n\n\ntransparency are likely to be imposed under new laws regulating AI, including the EU AI Act which became effective in 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply in 2026. The EU AI Act includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security and accuracy, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Once fully applicable, the EU AI Act will have a material impact on the way artificial intelligence is regulated in the EU, and together with developing guidance and/ or decisions in this area, is likely to affect our use of artificial intelligence and our ability to provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.; and\n\n•The GDPR also places limits on the profiling of individuals, i.e. processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects, like analyzing or predicting aspects of a person's economic situation, health, personal preferences, location, etc. There is increasing enforcement related to the lawfulness, fairness and transparency of this processing, and there is still uncertainty about the relevant lawful basis for this activity (i.e., consent or legitimate interests) and, in the case of legitimate interests, it is unclear what kind of opt-out or objection mechanism would be required to achieve GDPR compliance. We are continually monitoring for updates to guidance in this area, however, if subsequent guidance and/or decisions limit our ability to engage in profiling, that may decrease our operational efficiency and result in an increase to the costs of operating our business.\n\nWe are also subject to European Union rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses - a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism - alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. \n\nWe currently rely on the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK Addendum to the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement as relevant to transfer personal data outside the EEA and the UK with respect to both intragroup and third party transfers. We expect international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to be challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines; we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes; we may have to implement revised standard contractual clauses for existing intragroup, customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames; and/or it could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\nIn respect of the GDPR’s obligations, we rely on positions and interpretations of the law that have yet to be fully tested before the relevant courts and regulators. If a regulator or court of competent jurisdiction determined that one or more of our compliance efforts does not satisfy the applicable requirements of the GDPR, or if any party brought a claim in this regard, there could be potential governmental or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, compliance orders, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and that could cause customers to lose trust in us and damage our reputation. Likewise, a change in guidance could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n40\n\n\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. In the EU and the UK under national laws derived from the ePrivacy Directive, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent for cookies, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. Recent European court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. If the trend of increasing enforcement by regulators of the strict approach to opt-in consent for all but essential use cases, as seen in recent guidance and decisions continues this  may increase the cost of operating our business and lead to a decline in revenues and impair our ability to collect user information. In addition, legal uncertainties about the legality of cookies and other tracking technologies may lead to regulatory scrutiny and increase potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws. Any such changes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices which could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively and may adversely affect our ability to acquire customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In light of the complex and evolving nature of EU, EU Member State and UK privacy laws on cookies and tracking technologies be successful in our efforts to comply with such laws; violations of such laws could result in regulatory investigations, fines, orders to cease/ change our use of such technologies, as well as civil claims including class actions, and reputational damage.\n\nAny significant change to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices, regarding the use of personal data, or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices, and business practices, including potentially material changes. Such changes could potentially have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe may be unable to prevent or address the misappropriation of our data.\n\nFrom time to time, third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, bots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites or online apps may misappropriate data and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website or our online app. If we become aware of such websites or online apps, we intend to employ technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites or online apps in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites or online apps operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the effect of the operation of such websites or online apps. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites or online apps, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our Co-Founders, senior management team, highly-specialized insurance experts, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel.\n\nOur success depends upon the continued service of Daniel Schreiber, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, and Shai Wininger, our co-founder, President and a member of our board of directors (collectively with Mr. Schreiber, our \"Co-Founders\"), and senior management team, highly-specialized insurance experts and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. If we are unable to attract the requisite personnel, our business and prospects may be adversely affected. Each of our Co-Founders, executive officers, specialized insurance experts, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of either of our Co-Founders or any other member of our senior management team, specialized insurance experts or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic business objectives and could harm our business. We rely on a small number of highly-specialized insurance experts, the loss of any one of whom could have a disproportionate impact on our business. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. Our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Moreover, if and when the stock options or other equity awards are substantially vested, employees under such equity arrangements may be more likely to leave, particularly when the underlying shares have seen a value appreciation.\n\n41\n\n\nWe face significant competition for personnel, particularly in New York, where our headquarters is located and in Tel Aviv, where many of our technical employees are located. To attract top talent, we offer, and will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. We may also need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competitor actions. If we are unable to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs, or otherwise fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf our customers were to claim that the policies they purchased failed to provide adequate or appropriate coverage, we could face claims that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCustomers could purchase policies that prove to be inadequate or inappropriate, and if such customers were to bring a claim or claims alleging that we failed in our responsibilities to provide them with the type or amount of coverage that they sought to purchase, Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC or Metromile Insurance Services LLC could be found liable, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain agents errors and omissions insurance coverage to protect us against such liability, such coverage may be insufficient or inadequate.\n\nWe conduct certain of our operations in Israel and therefore our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel and the surrounding region.\n\nWe maintain offices in Israel and some of our officers, employees and directors are located in Israel, including our Co-Founders and some of our product development staff, help desk and online sales support operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 297 full-time employees in Israel. Although we do not currently sell our insurance products in Israel, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our Israeli operations. In recent years, including most recently in October 2023, Israel has been involved in sporadic armed conflicts with Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip, with Hezbollah, an Islamist terrorist group that controls large portions of Southern Lebanon, and with Iranian-backed military forces in Syria. Some of these hostilities, including the most recent attacks by Hamas in October 2023, were accompanied by missile strikes from the Gaza Strip against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our officers, employees and directors are located, and negatively affected conditions in Israel. The tension between Israel and Iran and/or these groups continues to escalate and may turn even more violent in the future, which could materially adversely affect conditions in Israel in general and our operations in particular.\n\nFurthermore, many Israeli citizens are obligated to perform several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to the recent terrorist activity, there have been call-ups of military reservists and it is possible that there will be increases in military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Some of our officers and employees based in Israel have been called upon to perform military reserve duty and/or active duty, and others may be called in the future. Our operations have been and may continue to be partially disrupted by these employee absences, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have contingency plans and structures in place to mitigate these risks, and we continue to monitor our ongoing activities and will make any needed adjustments to ensure the continuity of our business, while supporting the safety and well-being of our employees.\n\nParties with whom we do business may sometimes decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary to meet our business partners in person. Further, shifting economic and political conditions in the United States and in other countries may result in changes in how the United States and other countries conduct business and other relations with Israel, which may have an adverse impact on our Israeli operations and a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies whether as a result of hostilities in the region or otherwise. Moreover, there have been increased efforts by organizations and movements to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods based on Israeli government policies. Any hostilities, armed conflicts or political instability involving Israel could adversely affect our results of operations. With regards to the recent hostilities, there is still uncertainty regarding the extent to which it will impact our operations in Israel, which we continue to evaluate.\n\n42\n\n\nOur commercial insurance may not cover losses that could occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An escalation of tensions or violence might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business.\n\nIn addition, the Israeli government has recently and may in the future pursue extensive changes to Israel’s judicial system. In response to such changes, many individuals, organizations and institutions, both within and outside of Israel, have in the past and may in the future voice concerns that the proposed changes may negatively impact the business environment in Israel, due to potential reluctance of foreign investors to invest or transact business in Israel, increased currency fluctuations, downgrades in credit rating, increased interest rates, increased volatility in securities markets, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions. To the extent that any of these negative developments occur, they may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or our ability to raise additional funds, if deemed necessary by our management and board of directors.\n\nWe may become subject to claims under Israeli law for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our Israel-based employees or consultants, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business.\n\nWe enter into assignment of invention agreements with employees and consultants, pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967 (the \"Israel Patent Law\"), inventions conceived by an employee or a person deemed to be an employee (for example a consultant that was deemed to be an employee by the Israeli labor courts) during and in consequence of their employment are regarded as \"service inventions,\" which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between employee and employer. Nevertheless, in the case of a service invention, employees and former employees may petition the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee established under the Israel Patent Law to determine whether they are entitled to remuneration for their service inventions. Although in the assignment of invention agreements with our employees they agree to waive their right to any additional compensation with respect to the service inventions, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee and the Supreme Court have held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having waived such rights, resulting in uncertainty under Israeli law with respect to the efficacy of waivers of service invention rights. As such, we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned service inventions, and as a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current or former employees (or consultants that might be deemed as employees), or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our company culture has been critical to our success. Our status as a Certified B Corp and commitment to charitable giving distinguish us from our competitors and promote a relationship among our employees and customers founded on trust. We not only seek to engender a trusting relationship between our brand and our customers, but also among our employees. Our ability to continue to cultivate and maintain this culture is essential to our growth and continued success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\n\n•failure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\n\n•the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce, and our ability to promote a uniform and consistent culture across all our offices and employees;\n\n•the market perception about our charitable contributions and social and political stances;\n\n•competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\n\n•the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; and\n\n•the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us.\n\n43\n\n\nOur unique culture is one of our core characteristics that helps us to attract and retain key personnel. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we would have to incur additional costs and find alternative methods to recruit key employees, which in turn could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to be adversely affected.\n\nIf we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\n\nIn general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. The accuracy of our pricing is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks, estimate losses and comply with state insurance regulations. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. We also utilize the data that we gather through our interactions with our customers, as evaluated and curated by our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\nEstablishing adequate premium rates is necessary, together with investment income, if any, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") and other costs. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we underwrite, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our profitability. Moreover, if we determine that our prices are too low, insurance regulations may preclude us from being able to cancel insurance contracts, non-renew customers, or raise prices. Alternatively, we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nPricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. In order to accurately price our policies, we must:\n\n•collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our customers;\n\n•develop, test and apply appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas;\n\n•review and evaluate competitive product offerings and pricing dynamics;\n\n•closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and\n\n•project both frequency and severity of our customers' losses with reasonable accuracy.\n\nThere are no assurances that we will have success in implementing our pricing methodology accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to accurately price our policies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n•insufficient or unreliable data;\n\n•incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\n•uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\n•our failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies;\n\n•incorrect or incomplete analysis of the competitive environment;\n\n•regulatory constraints on rate increases; and\n\n•our failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expense, as well as unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\n\nTo address the potential inadequacy of our current business model, we may be compelled to increase the amount allocated to cover policy claims, increase premium rates or adopt tighter underwriting standards, any of which may result in a decline in new business and renewals and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n44\n\n\nOur exposure to loss activity and regulation may be greater in states where we currently have most of our customers: California, New York and Texas.\n\nApproximately 49% of our gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2024 originated from customers in California, New York, and Texas. As a result of this concentration, if a significant catastrophe event or series of such events occurs and causes material loss in California, New York and Texas, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. For example, the recent wildfires in the Greater Los Angeles area have underscored the potential for substantial claims in this key market and we continue to assess the impact to our business. Further, as compared to our competitors who operate on a wider geographic scale, any adverse changes in the regulatory environment affecting property and casualty insurance in California, New York and Texas may expose us to more significant risks.\n\nOur product development cycles are complex and subject to regulatory approval, and we may incur significant expenses before we generate revenues, if any, from new products.\n\nBecause our products are highly-advanced and require rigorous testing and regulatory approvals, development cycles can be complex. Moreover, development projects can be technically challenging and expensive, and may be delayed or defeated by the inability to obtain licensing or other regulatory approvals. The nature of these development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we generate revenues, if any, from such expenses. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of products that are competitive in the marketplace, this could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a product we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced. Such decreased customer demand may cause us to fall short of our sales targets, and we may nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the product's development. If we are unable to complete product development cycles successfully and in a timely fashion and generate revenues from such future products, the growth of our business may be harmed.\n\nLitigation and legal proceedings filed by or against us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLitigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, complaints from or litigation by customers or reinsurers, related to alleged breaches of contract or otherwise. As our market share increases, competitors may pursue litigation to require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. As is typical in the insurance industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types arising in the normal course of our business operations, including disputes relating to insurance claims under our policies as well as other general commercial and corporate litigation. Although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, us and other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including sale of insurance and claim settlement practices. In addition, because we employ artificial intelligence to collect data points, customers or consumer groups have brought and could bring individual or class action claims alleging that our methods of collecting or using data and pricing risk are impermissibly discriminatory or otherwise improper. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such material litigation in the future or what impact such material litigation would have on our business. If we were to be involved in litigation and it was determined adversely, it could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even claims without merit can be time- consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, routine lawsuits over claims that are not individually material could in the future become material if aggregated with a substantial number of similar lawsuits. In addition to increasing costs, a significant volume of customer complaints or litigation could adversely affect our brand and reputation, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable. We cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation or other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation, and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition. See \"Legal Proceedings.\"\n\n45\n\n\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur success is dependent in part on protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as source code, information, data, processes and other forms of information, knowhow and technology). We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, there are steps that we have not yet taken to protect our intellectual property on a global basis. Additionally, the steps that we have already taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights.\n\nWhile we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use our proprietary brand, content and information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our competitive position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party providers and strategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our offerings. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\n\nWe have filed, and may continue in the future to file, applications to protect certain of our innovations and intellectual property. We do not know whether any of our applications will result in the issuance of a patent, trademark or copyright, as applicable, or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, we may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our intellectual property. Our existing intellectual property, and any intellectual property granted to us or that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing our rights to our intellectual property. Therefore, the exact effect of the protection of this intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, given the costs, effort, risks and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations. Any failure to adequately obtain such patent protection, or other intellectual property protection, could later prove to adversely impact our business.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Lemonade and Lemonade.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our online app. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or impossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\n\n46\n\n\nIf we are unable to prevent the unauthorized use or exploitation of our intellectual property, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to customers and potential customers may become confused, and our ability to attract customers may be adversely affected. Any inability or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nCompanies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we gain an increasingly high public profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. We may not be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or from operating under our brand, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to violate such rights, which may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had gross accumulated federal NOLs for tax purposes of $296.2 million, which can be offset against our future taxable income. Of these federal NOLs, $10.5 million in losses will begin to expire in 2035 and $285.7 million in losses can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has gross accumulated state and local losses for tax purposes of $35.3 million which will begin to expire in 2029.\n\nWe may be unable to fully use our NOLs, if at all. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (very generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in the corporation's equity ownership by certain shareholders or groups of shareholders over a rolling three- year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may or may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we have undergone an ownership change, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs existing at the time of the ownership change prior to their expiration. Future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\n47\n\n\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in tax legislation or policies in different geographic jurisdictions may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors, including: changing tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof (such as the Inflation Reduction Act which, among other changes, introduced a 15% corporate minimum tax on certain United States corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by United States corporations); tax policy initiatives and reforms in effect or under consideration (such as those related to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing or other projects); the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties.\n\nWe are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and otherwise affect our future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\n\nOur expansion within the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to expand into additional markets in the United States and abroad. As of December 31, 2024, we were licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in 50 states of the United States and Washington D.C. We operate in 39 of those states and Washington D.C. covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population. We have targeted coverage across all 50 states, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to provide nationwide coverage in the near term or at all. Moreover, one or more states could revoke our license to operate, or implement additional regulatory hurdles that could inhibit our ability to obtain or maintain our license in such states.\n\nIn addition to growing our domestic business, we have started expanding our presence internationally, particularly in Europe. We currently hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe, and commenced operating in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October, 2022, the Company began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime. The Company also registered two UK branches: (i) Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch and its affiliate (ii) Lemonade Agency B.V.. In May and June 2023, respectively, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for both of these registered branches allowing us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market. Operating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Moreover, international operations are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in operating in these regions, including political unrest, such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n•obtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\n\n•complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to the insurance business and insurance distribution, capital and outsourcing requirements, data privacy, tax and local regulatory restrictions;\n\n•recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries;\n\n•competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n\n•differing demand dynamics, which may make our product offerings less successful;\n\n•currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n•operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and\n\n•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\n\n48\n\n\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, international expansion may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\n\nExpansion into new markets here and abroad will require additional investments by us in both regulatory approvals and marketing. These incremental costs may include hiring additional personnel, as well as engaging third-party service providers and other research and development costs. If we fail to grow our geographic footprint or geographic growth occurs at a slower rate than expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nSince we conduct limited operations in Israel and Europe, portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in New Israeli Shekels, Euros and GBP pounds. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies may affect our revenues, income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nExternal events such as Brexit, global pandemics, the ongoing uncertainty regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies, including under the new U.S. Presidential administration, the passage of U.S. taxation reform legislation, and concerns over interest rates (particularly short-term rates) each have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially among the U.S. dollar, the GBP pounds and the euro. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the UK, European Union, the United States or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further, the value of the GBP pounds and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken.\n\nThe impact of the Customer Investment Agreement with General Catalyst is unpredictable, and the arrangement may not function as expected, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOn January 8, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Customer Investment Agreement (the “Customer Investment Agreement”), with GC Customer Value Arranger, LLC (a General Catalyst company) (\"GC\"). Under the Customer Investment Agreement, up to $150 million of financing will be provided from June 28, 2023 through December 31, 2024, and up to $140 million will be provided from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, in each case for the Company’s sales and marketing growth efforts. This Customer Investment Agreement was further amended and restated in April 2024 and June 2024 to clarify certain provisions. On February 3, 2025, the Customer Investment Agreement was further amended under which GC will provide up to an additional $200 million of financing from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2026. Under the Customer Investment Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions specified therein, at the start of each growth period, an Investment Amount of up to 80% of the Company’s growth spend (the \"Investment Amount\") will be advanced by GC. During each growth period, we will repay each Investment Amount including a 16% rate of return, based upon an agreed schedule. Once fully repaid, we will retain all future reference income related to each respective Investment Amount. The Customer Investment Agreement is intended to deliver cash flow benefits to support our sales and marketing growth efforts. There can be no guarantee that this financing structure will function as intended, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n49\n\n\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\n\nThe insurance business, including the market for renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nHistorically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, adverse litigation trends, regulatory constraints, general economic conditions, and other factors. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of capital available to the industry that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry. As a result, the insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity increased premium levels. Demand for insurance depends on numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, the introduction of new capital providers and general economic conditions. All of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the insurance industry.\n\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to underwrite insurance at rates we consider appropriate and commensurate relative to the risk assumed. Additionally, negative market conditions could result in a decline in policies sold, an increase in the frequency of claims and premium defaults, and an uptick in the frequency of falsification of claims. If we cannot underwrite insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business will be materially and adversely affected. Any of these factors could lead to an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to extensive insurance industry regulations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in 50 states of the United States, and operate in 39 of those states, and Washington, D.C. We also hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe, and commenced operating in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and in France in 2020. We also began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime in October 2022. In 2023, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market.\n\nIn the United States, each state regulator retains the authority to license insurers in their states, and an insurer generally may not operate in a state in which it is not licensed. Accordingly, we are not permitted to sell insurance to residents of the remaining states and territories of the United States, which is likely to put us at a disadvantage among many of our competitors that have been in business much longer than us and are licensed to sell their insurance products in most, if not all, U.S. jurisdictions. We have a reinsurance captive subsidiary, Lemonade Re SPC, domiciled in the Cayman Islands which is subject to inspections by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the states in which we transact business by the individual state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of customers, and not necessarily the interests of insurers or agents, their shareholders or other investors. Numerous aspects of our insurance business are subject to regulation, including, but not limited to, premium rates, mandatory covered risks, limitations on the ability to renew or elect not to renew business, prohibited exclusions, licensing and appointment of agents, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of customers, investments and capital, policy forms and coverages, advertising and other conduct, including restrictions on the use of credit information and other factors in underwriting, as well as other underwriting and claims practices. To the extent we decide to expand our current product offerings to include other insurance products, this would subject us to additional regulatory requirements and scrutiny in each state in which we elect to offer such products. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance. Prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresentations, false advertising, coercion, disparaging other insurers, unfair claims settlement procedures, and discrimination in the business of insurance. Noncompliance with any of such state statute may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents.\n\n50\n\n\nSuch laws, rules and regulations are usually overseen and enforced by the various state insurance departments, as well as through private rights of action and by state attorneys general. Such regulations or enforcement actions are often responsive to current consumer and political sensitivities, such as homeowners insurance rates and coverage forms, or which may arise after a major event. Such rules and regulations may result in rate suppression, limit our ability to manage our exposure to unprofitable or volatile risks, or lead to fines, premium refunds or other adverse consequences. The federal government also may regulate aspects of our businesses, such as the protection of consumer confidential information or the use of consumer insurance (credit) scores to underwrite and assess the risk of customers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). Among other things, the FCRA requires insurance companies to have a permissible purpose before obtaining and using a consumer report for underwriting purposes, as well as comply with related notice and recordkeeping requirements. Failure to comply with federal requirements under the FCRA or any other applicable federal laws would subject us to regulatory fines and other sanctions. In addition, given our short operating history to-date and rapid speed of growth, we are particularly vulnerable to regulators identifying errors in the policy forms we use, the rates we charge, and our customer communications. As a result of such noncompliance, regulators could impose fines, rebates or other penalties, including cease-and-desist orders for an individual state, or all states, until the identified noncompliance is rectified.\n\nOur ability to retain state licenses depends on our ability to meet licensing requirements established by the NAIC and adopted by each state, subject to variations across states. If we are unable to satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of any particular state, we could lose our license to do business in such state, which would result in the temporary or permanent cessation of our operations in that state. Alternatively, if we are unable to satisfy applicable state licensing requirements, we may be subject to additional regulatory oversight, have our license suspended, or be subject to seizure of assets. Any such events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \"Regulation — Required Licensing.\"\n\nIn addition, as a condition to writing business in certain states, insurers are required to participate in various pools or risk sharing mechanisms or to accept certain classes of risk, regardless of whether such risks meet their underwriting requirements for voluntary business. Some states also limit or impose restrictions on the ability of an insurer to withdraw from certain classes of business. New York, among other states, imposes significant restrictions on a company's ability to materially reduce its exposures or to withdraw from certain lines of business. The state insurance departments can impose significant charges on an insurer in connection with a market withdrawal or refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal of policies or that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may significantly restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. Such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure to hurricane-related losses.\n\nOur European insurance entities, Lemonade Insurance N.V., Lemonade Agency B.V. and Lemonade B.V., are subject to primary supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, \"DNB\") as the supervisory authority of its home member state, the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, \"AFM\"), and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, \"BaFin\") as the supervisory authority of a host member state. DNB and AFM expect firms to avoid actions that jeopardize compliance with their statutory objectives and applicable rules and regulations and have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated firm. When DNB is concerned that an insurer may present a risk, this may lead to negative consequences, including the requirement to maintain a higher level of regulatory capital (via capital \"add-ons\" under the Solvency II Directive) to match the higher perceived risks and enforcement action where the risks identified breach applicable rules and regulations. In the case of a breach of our license requirements or obligations arising from the applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to the DNB and the AFM's sanctions, including (public) formal warnings, orders to adopt a certain course of conduct, incremental penalties and administrative fines, revocation of an undertaking license and, in the case of insurers, where the breach relates to material prudential shortcomings, emergency measures (including the appointment of an administrator or the imposition of measures aimed at winding-up the undertaking). Any such events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \"Business - Regulation - European Regulation.\"\n\n51\n\n\nState insurance regulators impose additional reporting requirements regarding enterprise risk on insurance holding company systems, with which we must comply as an insurance holding company.\n\nWe are subject to the insurance holding company laws of New York, Delaware and California, which require LIC and MIC to register with the NYDFS, DE Dept. and CDI, as applicable, and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of LIC and MIC. These statutes also provide that all transactions among members of a holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of specified types, such transactions require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the NYDFS, DE Dept. or the CDI, as applicable. These prior notification and approval requirements may result in business delays and additional business expenses. If we fail to comply with such requirements or fail to comply with other applicable insurance regulations in New York, Delaware or California, we may be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the applicable state insurance departments.\n\nIn the past decade, various state insurance regulators have increased their focus on risks within an insurer's holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to the insurer. In 2012, the NAIC adopted significant changes to the insurance holding company act and regulations (the \"NAIC Amendments\"). The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. One of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company system's ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an \"enterprise risk report\" that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Other changes include requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control, having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and expanding of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator. The NAIC Amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective. New York State, Delaware and California include a form of the enterprise risk report requirement.\n\nIn 2012, the NAIC also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the \"ORSA Model Act\"). The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company system's Chief Risk Officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (\"ORSA\"). The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer's current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. The ORSA Model Act must be adopted by the individual state legislature and insurance regulators in order to be effective. While New York has not formally passed the ORSA requirement, it has implemented a form \"F\" filing requirement that is the initial response to the ORSA Model Act. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that the NAIC Amendments, compliance with the ORSA Model Act, or any other regulatory requirements may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation.\n\nThe increasing adoption by states of cybersecurity regulations could impose additional compliance burdens on us and expose us to additional liability.\n\nIn response to the growing threat of cyber-attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions, including New York, have begun to consider new cybersecurity measures, including the adoption of cybersecurity regulations. In March 2017, the NYDFS promulgated Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which requires covered financial institutions, including LIC, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program and implement and maintain cybersecurity policies and procedures with specific requirements. On November 1, 2023, the NYDFS amended the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies to expand such requirements and add new obligations. Additionally, on October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted its Insurance Data Security Model Law, intended to serve as model legislation for states to enact in order to govern cybersecurity and data protection practices of insurers, insurance agents, and other licensed entities registered under state insurance laws. Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin have adopted versions of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law, each with a different effective date, and other states may adopt versions of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law in the future. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is an EU regulation that entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply as of 17 January 2025. The DORA aims to ensure that financial entities better manage ICT (Information Communication Technologies) risks and become more resilient to \n\n52\n\n\ncyber threats and ICT disruptions. To this end, DORA contains various requirements, including for managing the risks arising from the use of ICT third party service providers. Although we take steps to comply with financial industry cybersecurity regulations and believe we are materially compliant with their requirements, our failure to comply with new or existing cybersecurity regulations could result in regulatory actions and other penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with new or existing cybersecurity regulations could impose significant costs on our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation of Enterprise Risk, Cybersecurity, and Other Recent Developments\".\n\nSevere weather events and other catastrophes, including the effects of climate change and global pandemics, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition.\n\nOur renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Severe weather events include, but are not limited to, winter storms, rain, hail, wild fires and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, fires, and other non-natural events such as explosions, riots, terrorism, or war.\n\nThe incidence and severity of severe weather conditions and catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and the occurrence of one catastrophe does not render the possibility of another catastrophe greater or lower. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. In particular, severe weather and other catastrophes could significantly increase our costs due to a surge in claims following such events and/or legal and regulatory changes in response to catastrophes that may impair our ability to limit our liability under our policies. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause greater losses for us, which can cause our liquidity and financial condition to deteriorate. Resulting reductions in our capital could materially adversely affect our ability to underwrite new insurance policies. In addition, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates and in amounts adequate to mitigate the risks associated with severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. While we only work with reinsurers whom we believe have acceptable credit, if our reinsurers are unable to pay for the claims for which they are responsible, we could be exposed to additional liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nClimate change may affect the occurrence of certain natural events, such as an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm events, eruptions of volcanoes, and tornado or hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere; more frequent wildfires in certain geographies; higher incidence of deluge flooding and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. Additionally, climate change may cause an impact on the demand, price and availability of homeowners and renters insurance and reinsurance coverages, as well as the value of our investment portfolio. Due to significant variability associated with future changing climate conditions, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our business.\n\nIn addition, global pandemics may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Any pandemic, epidemic or future outbreak of disease or public health concern, could cause an economic slowdown which could result in an increase in fraudulent claims or a decrease in apartment rentals or home sales, an increase in costs associated with claims under our policies, as well as an increase in the number of customers experiencing difficulty paying premiums, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n53\n\n\nClimate risks, including risks associated with disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal, state and local regulatory agencies have and may continue to propose and enact initiatives related to climate change. Conversely, the federal government has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and indicated reversal of related commitments or policies. Such fragmented policies across jurisdictions, and changes in laws or regulations, may result in increased compliance and administrative costs. Similarly, if new legislation or regulation is enacted, we could incur increased costs and capital expenditures to comply with its limitations, which may impact our financial condition and operating performance.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny, actions and changing expectations from investors, clients, regulators and our employees and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may impose additional costs on us, impact our access to capital, or expose us to new or additional risks.\n\nIncreased focus, including from governmental organizations, investors, employees, clients and other stakeholders, on ESG matters such as environmental stewardship, climate change, pay equity, workplace conduct and cybersecurity and data privacy, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance and stakeholder engagement), impact our reputation, or otherwise affect our business performance. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate, if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these issues, including if we fail to demonstrate progress towards any current or future ESG goals. Any harm to our reputation could negatively impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers to do business with us.\n\nESG matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators, including in the U.S., EU, and the UK. In the event divergent ESG disclosure obligations arise between the U.S., UK and the EU, this may also present an increased compliance risk if we are required to comply with different regulatory standards. Additionally, conflicting ESG policies within jurisdictions, such as between federal and some state policies in the U.S., is leading to a complex and fragmented regulatory environment, which may be difficult to navigate. \n\nIt is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. At the same time, certain stakeholders might not be satisfied that we have adopted ESG practices at all, and several states having enacted or proposed \"anti-ESG\" policies or legislation. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG practices and reporting could negatively impact our business. If we do not successfully manage ESG-related expectations across stakeholders, it could erode stakeholder trust, impact our reputation, subject us to shareholder activism or litigation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices.\n\nIn addition, a variety of organizations have developed ratings to measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of some of these assessments are widely publicized. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. In addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ratings of the Company or our industry, as well as omission of inclusion of our stock into ESG-oriented investment funds may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.\n\n54\n\n\nWe expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality and volatility, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results or in perceptions of our business prospects.\n\nOur revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period and may fail to match expectations as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our results may vary as a result of fluctuations in the number of customers purchasing our insurance products and fluctuations in the timing and amount of our expenses. In addition, the insurance industry, and particularly renters and homeowners insurance, are subject to their own cyclical trends and uncertainties, including extreme weather which is often seasonal and may result in volatility in claims reporting and payment patterns. Fluctuations and variability across the industry may affect our revenue. As a result of the potential variations in our revenue and results of operations, period-to-period comparisons may not be meaningful and the results of any one period should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. In addition, our results of operations may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow us, which may adversely affect our stock price.\n\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and resulting fluctuations in our rate of growth as a result of insurance spending patterns. Specifically, our revenues may be proportionately higher in our third fiscal quarter due to the seasonality of when renters and homeowners move into new homes, which historically occurs in the months of July, August and September. Accordingly, the amount of growth we experience may also be greater in the third quarter. In addition, as our business expands and matures, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality and customer behavior that we experience may change. Volatility in our key operating metrics or their rates of growth could have a negative impact on our financial results and investor perceptions of our business prospects and a failure to achieve our quarterly forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors will cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWe rely on data from our customers and third parties for pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, handling claims and maximizing automation, the unavailability or inaccuracy of which could limit the functionality of our products and disrupt our business.\n\nWe use data, technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our products, including insurance industry proprietary information that we license from Insurance Services Office, Inc. (\"ISO\"), and we may license additional third-party technology and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party technology and intellectual property could result in errors that could harm our brand and business. In addition, licensed technology and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, should ISO refuse to license its proprietary information to us on the same terms that it offers to our competitors, we could be placed at a significant competitive disadvantage.\n\nFurther, although we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for the third-party technology and intellectual property we presently use other than proprietary information provided by ISO, the loss of our right to use any of this technology and intellectual property could result in delays in producing or delivering affected products until equivalent technology or intellectual property is identified, licensed or otherwise procured, and integrated. Our business would be disrupted if any technology and intellectual property we license from others or functional equivalents of this software were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required either to attempt to redesign our products to function with technology and intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in product sales and the release of new product offerings. Alternatively, we might be forced to limit the features available in affected products. Any of these results could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to limitations in the analytical models used to assess and predict our exposure to catastrophe losses.\n\nAlong with others in the insurance industry, models developed internally and by third party vendors are used along with our own historical data in assessing property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses. These models assume various conditions and probability scenarios; however, they do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or measure losses currently incurred. Further, the accuracy of such models may be negatively impacted by changing climate conditions. Catastrophe models use historical information and scientific research about natural events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as detailed information about our in-force business. This information is used in connection with pricing and risk management activities. However, since actual catastrophic events vary considerably, there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting \n\n55\n\n\nperiod. Other limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models, material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and actual conditions that are not yet well understood or may not be properly incorporated into the models.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nWe currently rely on third-party vendors to provide payment processing services, including the processing of payments from credit cards and debit cards, and our business would be disrupted if these vendors become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us and we are unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis. If we or our processing vendor fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if these systems fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers' credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\n\nThe payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data are compromised due to a breach of data, we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur success depends upon the insurance industry continuing to move online at its current pace and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services.\n\nWe provide renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance products through our website and our online app that compete with traditional offline counterparts. We do not generally offer insurance through traditional, offline brokers. We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend, to a large extent, on the continued growth in commercial use of the internet and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online.\n\nPurchasers of insurance may develop the perception that purchasing insurance products online is not as effective as purchasing such products through a broker or other traditional offline methods, and the homeowners and renters insurance markets may not migrate online as quickly as (or at the levels that) we expect. Moreover, if, for any reason, an unfavorable perception develops that data automation, artificial intelligence and/or bots are less efficacious than traditional offline methods of purchasing insurance, underwriting, claims processing, and other functions that use data automation, artificial intelligence and/or bots, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nOur actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur financial condition and results of operations depends on our ability to accurately assess potential losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the policies we underwrite. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what the expected ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the current estimate. In our industry, there is always the risk that reserves may prove inadequate as it is possible for us to underestimate the cost of claims and claims administration.\n\nWe base our estimates on our assessment of known facts and circumstances, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, judicial theories of liability, and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events that could increase our exposure to losses, including changes in actuarial projections, claims handling procedures, inflation, severe weather, climate change, economic and judicial trends and legislative changes. We regularly monitor reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of \n\n56\n\n\nstatistical techniques to update our current estimate. Our estimates could prove to be inadequate, and this underestimation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nRecorded claim reserves, including case reserves and incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims reserves, are based on our estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of the circumstances, including settlement agreements. Additionally, models that rely on the assumption that past loss development patterns will persist into the future are used. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, contractual terms and changes in claim reporting, and settlement practices. External factors are also considered, such as court decisions, changes in law and litigation imposing unintended coverage. We also consider benefits, such as disallowing the use of benefit payment schedules, requiring coverage designed to cover losses that occur in a single policy period to losses that develop continuously over multiple policy periods or requiring the availability of multiple limits. Regulatory requirements and economic conditions are also considered.\n\nSince reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process that is regularly refined to reflect current estimation processes and practices. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as the reserves and reinsurance recoverables are reestimated.\n\nIf any of our insurance reserves should prove to be inadequate for the reasons discussed above, or for any other reason, we will be required to increase reserves, resulting in a reduction in our net income and stockholders' equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity and financial rating, which would affect our ability to attract new business or to retain existing customers.\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of the State of New York and Delaware, respectively. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the NYDFS, or DE Dept., as applicable and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company's total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined using the NAIC's risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\n\nAn insurance company with total adjusted capital that is less than 200% of its authorized control level risk-based capital is at a company action level, which would require the insurance company to file a risk-based capital plan that, among other things, contains proposals of corrective actions the Company intends to take that are reasonably expected to result in the elimination of the Company action level event. Additional action level events occur when the insurer's total adjusted capital falls below 150%, 100%, and 70% of its authorized control level risk-based capital. The lower the percentage, the more severe the regulatory response, including, in the event of a mandatory control level event (total adjusted capital falls below 70% of the insurer's authorized control level risk-based capital), placing the insurance company into receivership. As of December 31, 2024, our risk-based capital ratio was 577% for LIC and 525% for MIC.\n\nOur wholly-owned, Cayman Islands-based captive reinsurer, Lemonade Re SPC, is subject to capital and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”). Although these capital requirements are generally less constraining than U.S. capital requirements, failure to satisfy these requirements could result in regulatory actions from the CIMA or loss of or modification of Lemonade Re SPC’s insurer license, which could adversely impact our ability to improve our overall capital efficiency.\n\nIn addition, our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples of its capital and surplus. The insurance subsidiaries could exceed these ratios if its volume increases faster than anticipated or if its surplus declines due to catastrophe or non-catastrophe losses or excessive underwriting and operational expenses.\n\n57\n\n\nAny failure by our insurance subsidiaries to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations imposed by the laws of the State of New York or Delaware, as applicable (or other states where currently or may in the future conduct business) could subject them to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision, or liquidation.\n\nAny changes in existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements, or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Risk-Based Capital.\"\n\nWe are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds, and mandatory state insurance facilities, which may affect our ability to achieve profitability.\n\nThe insurance laws of many states subject property and casualty insurers doing business in those states to statutory property and casualty guaranty fund assessments. The purpose of a guaranty fund is to protect customers by requiring that solvent property and casualty insurers pay the insurance claims of insolvent insurers. These guaranty associations generally pay these claims by assessing solvent insurers proportionately based on each insurer's share of voluntary premiums written in the state. While most guaranty associations provide for recovery of assessments through subsequent rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits, there is no assurance that insurers will ultimately recover these assessments, which could be material, particularly following a large catastrophe or in markets which become disrupted.\n\nMaximum contributions required by law in any one year vary by state. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments because they depend on factors outside our control, such as insolvencies of other insurance companies. Significant assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Insolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools, and Insurance Facilities.\"\n\nOur ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business is partially dependent on us maintaining our Demotech, Inc. rating, and may be negatively affected by the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\n\nOur insurance subsidiary, LIC, currently has a Financial Stability Rating (\"FSR\") of 'A' Exceptional from Demotech, Inc., a financial analysis firm that provides FSRs as well as consulting services for property and casualty insurance companies and title underwriters. Demotech, Inc. provides financial stability ratings to insurance companies of all sizes. When providing a rating, Demotech, Inc. evaluates total assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, working capital, administrative expenses, net income, surplus, receivables, amount of business written, industry focus and business model, among others. Below is Demotech, Inc.'s rating scale:\n\n•A\" (A Double Prime), Unsurpassed: 100% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•A' (A Prime), Unsurpassed: 99% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•A, Exceptional: 97% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•S, Substantial: 95% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•M, Moderate: 90% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment; and\n\n•L, Licensed: These companies have been assessed but have not been given one of the financial strength ratings listed above.\n\n58\n\n\nWhile our Demotech, Inc. rating has proved satisfactory to date, we cannot assure that this rating will remain at its current level and it is possible that some prospective customers may be reluctant to do business with a company that is not rated by A.M. Best. We have not been reviewed by A.M. Best and do not currently intend to seek a rating from A.M. Best. Unlike Demotech, Inc., A.M. Best may penalize companies that are highly leveraged, including those companies that utilize reinsurance to support premium writings. We do not plan to give up revenues or efficiency of size as a means to qualify for an acceptable A.M. Best rating. Not having an A.M. Best rating may prevent us from expanding our business or limit our access to credit from certain financial institutions, which may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies.\n\nPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. We seek to hold a diversified portfolio of investments in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by our Investment Committee. However, our investments are subject to general economic and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities.\n\nOur primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Part II Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” A protracted low interest rate environment could place pressure on our net investment income, particularly as it relates to fixed income securities and short-term investments, which, in turn, may adversely affect our operating results. A protracted high interest rate environment could cause the values of our fixed income securities portfolios to decline, with the magnitude of the decline depending on the duration of securities included in our portfolio and the amount by which interest rates increase. Some fixed income securities have call or prepayment options, which create possible reinvestment risk in declining rate environments. Other fixed income securities, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk or, in a rising interest rate environment, may not prepay as quickly as expected.\n\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities we hold, or due to deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments on such investments. Downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities also have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities.\n\nSuch factors could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. Our investment portfolio is subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the securities we hold in our portfolio does not reflect prices at which actual transactions would occur.\n\nWe may also invest in marketable equity securities. These securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value and are subject to potential losses and declines in market value.\n\nRisks for all types of securities are managed through the application of our investment policy, which establishes investment parameters that include, but are not limited to, maximum percentages of investment in certain types of securities and minimum levels of credit quality, which we believe are within applicable guidelines established by the NAIC, the NYDFS and the DE Department.\n\nAlthough we seek to preserve our capital, we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. In addition, although we seek to employ investment strategies that are not correlated with our insurance and reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate the adverse effect of the losses on us.\n\n59\n\n\nUnexpected changes in the interpretation of our coverage or provisions, including loss limitations and exclusions, in our policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSpecifically negotiated loss limitations or exclusions in our policies may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. For example, many of our policies limit the period during which a customer may bring a claim, which may be shorter than the statutory period under which such claims can be brought against our customers. While these limitations and exclusions help us assess and mitigate our loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void a limitation or exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such limitations or exclusions. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated loss and loss adjustment expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, court decisions could read policy exclusions narrowly so as to expand coverage, thereby requiring insurers to create and write new exclusions. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Existence as a Public Benefit Corporation\n\nWe operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation. As a public benefit corporation, we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to produce a public benefit or benefits and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, balancing our stockholders' pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or benefits identified by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amended Charter”). There is no assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose or that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to publicly disclose a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.\n\nIf we lose our certification as a Certified B Corp or our publicly reported B Corp score declines, or if state or federal regulators restrict, delay or otherwise interfere with our ability to make charitable contributions, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business model and brand could be harmed if we were to lose our certification as a Certified B Corp or if state or federal regulators impede or otherwise delay or restrict our ability to make charitable contributions. Certified B Corp status is a certification that requires us to consider the impact of our decisions on our workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment. We believe that Certified B Corp status has allowed us to build credibility and trust among our customers. Whether due to our choice or our failure to meet B Lab's certification requirements, any change in our status could create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corp. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corp score declines and there is a perception that we are no longer committed to the Certified B Corp standards. Similarly, our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with B Lab's values. See \"Business — Certified B Corp Status.\"\n\nFurthermore, state or federal regulators could restrict, delay, or otherwise interfere with our ability to contribute the residual amount left over after paying claims and reinsurance to nonprofits selected by our customers. This could erode customer trust in our products and services, weaken incentives for good customer behavior, and drive down demand for our products and services.\n\nAny such harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n60\n\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively impact our financial performance.\n\nUnlike traditional corporations, which have a fiduciary duty to focus exclusively on maximizing stockholder value, our directors have a fiduciary duty to consider not only the stockholders' interests, but also the Company's specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by our actions. Therefore, we may take actions that we believe will be in the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our specific benefit purpose, even if those actions do not maximize our financial results. While we intend for this public benefit designation and obligation to provide an overall net benefit to us and our customers, it could instead cause us to make decisions and take actions without seeking to maximize the income generated from our business, and hence available for distribution to our stockholders. Our pursuit of longer-term or non-pecuniary benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all, yet may have an immediate negative effect on any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are less attractive as a takeover target than a traditional company would be and, therefore, your ability to realize your investment through an acquisition may be limited. Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation cannot merge or consolidate with another entity if, as a result of such merger or consolidation, the surviving entity's charter \"does not contain the identical provisions identifying the public benefit or public benefits,\" unless the transaction receives approval from two-thirds of the target public benefit corporation's outstanding voting shares. Additionally, public benefit corporations may also not be attractive targets for activists or hedge fund investors because new directors would still have to consider and give appropriate weight to the public benefit along with shareholder value, and shareholders committed to the public benefit can enforce this through derivative suits. Further, by requiring that board of directors of public benefit corporations consider additional constituencies other than maximizing shareholder value, Delaware public benefit corporation law could potentially make it easier for a board to reject a hostile bid, even where the takeover would provide the greatest short-term financial yield to investors.\n\nOur directors have a fiduciary duty to consider not only our stockholders' interests, but also our specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by our actions. If a conflict between such interests arises, there is no guarantee such a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders.\n\nWhile directors of traditional corporations are required to make decisions they believe to be in the best interests of their stockholders, directors of a public benefit corporation have a fiduciary duty to consider not only the stockholders' interests, but also the company's specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by the company's actions. Under Delaware law, directors are shielded from liability for breach of these obligations if they make informed and disinterested decisions that serve a rational purpose. Thus, unlike traditional corporations which must focus exclusively on stockholder value, our directors are not merely permitted, but obligated, to consider our specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders. In the event of a conflict between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of our specific public benefit or our other stakeholders, our directors must only make informed and disinterested decisions that serve a rational purpose; thus, there is no guarantee such a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nAs a Delaware public benefit corporation, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our duty to balance stockholder and public benefit interest, the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nStockholders of a Delaware public benefit corporation (if they, individually or collectively, own at least two percent of the company's outstanding shares) are entitled to file a derivative lawsuit claiming the directors failed to balance stockholder and public benefit interests. This potential liability does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore, we may be subject to the possibility of increased derivative litigation, which would require the attention of our management, and, as a result, may adversely impact our management's ability to effectively execute our strategy. Additionally, any such derivative litigation may be costly, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n61\n\n\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Warrants\n\nThe market price of our common stock and warrants may be volatile or decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you initially paid for our common stock.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock and warrants could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and included elsewhere in this document may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock and warrants:\n\n•the occurrence of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes;\n\n•our operating and financial performance, quarterly or annual earnings relative to similar companies;\n\n•publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\n•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\n•announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships;\n\n•any major change in our board of directors or senior management, including the departure of either of our Co-Founders;\n\n•additional sales of our common stock and warrants by us, our directors, executive officers, principal shareholders, or our Co-Founders;\n\n•adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\n•short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock and warrants;\n\n•exposure to capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, realized investment losses, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and performance of insurance- linked investments;\n\n•our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance, and prospects;\n\n•our dividend policy and whether dividends on our common stock and warrants have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;\n\n•perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\n•regulatory or legal developments;\n\n•changes in general market, economic, and political conditions;\n\n•conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;\n\n•short selling activities\n\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\n•threatened or actual litigation or government investigations.\n\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock and warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance, and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. In addition, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\n\nProvisions in our Amended Charter and our Amended Bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\n•our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n\n•nothing in our Amended Charter precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock;\n\n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\n•our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\n62\n\n\n•only our chairman of the board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president (in the absence of the chief executive officer), or a majority of the board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\n•no provision in our Amended Charter or Amended Bylaws provides for cumulative voting, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\n•directors will only be able to be removed for cause;\n\n•certain amendments to our Amended Charter will require the approval of two-thirds of the then outstanding voting power of our capital stock;\n\n•our Amended Bylaws will provide that the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock, voting as a single class, is required for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n\n•our Amended Charter authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of our capital stock; and\n\n•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire. \n\nApplicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control.\n\nUnder applicable state insurance laws and regulations, no person may acquire control of a domestic insurer until written approval is obtained from the state insurance commissioner following a public hearing on the proposed acquisition. Such approval would be contingent upon the state insurance commissioner's consideration of a number of factors including, among others, the financial strength of the proposed acquiror, the acquiror's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti- competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. LIC is domiciled in New York and MIC is domiciled in Delaware. Per the applicable laws and regulations of New York and Delaware, respectively, generally no person may acquire control of any insurer, whether by purchase of its securities or otherwise, unless it gives prior notice to the insurer and has received prior approval from the superintendent or Commissioner of Financial Services. Under New York and Delaware insurance law, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. These requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of Lemonade, Inc., including through transactions that some or all of the stockholders might consider to be desirable. \n\nOur Amended Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\n\nOur Amended Charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or to any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. By becoming a stockholder in the Company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Amended Charter related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our Amended Charter may limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Additionally, the enforceability of choice of forum provisions in other companies’ governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Amended\n\nCharter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If so, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n63\n\n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the NYSE and the NYSE American regarding our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\n\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the New York Stock Exchange American (“NYSE American”). These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Such reporting obligations place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as our personnel. \n\nIn addition, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting by the time our second annual report is filed with the SEC and thereafter, which will require us to document and make changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(b) requires our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nWe expect to continue to incur costs related to implementing an internal audit and compliance function in the upcoming years to further enhance our internal control environment. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the demands placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.\n\nWe depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations, and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law.\n\nWe are a holding company that transacts a majority of our business through operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our operating and financing cash needs depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries, and upon the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.\n\nPayments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. The limitations are based on income and surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, not GAAP. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future, including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future. Our insurance subsidiaries may also face competitive pressures in the future to maintain insurance financial stability or strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements would affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments and we may not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our obligations. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Restrictions on Paying Dividends.\"\n\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\n\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, for the future operation and expansion of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations (including our ability to generate cash flow in excess of expenses and our expected or actual net income), liquidity, cash requirements, financial condition, retained earnings and collateral and capital requirements, general business conditions, contractual restrictions, legal, tax and regulatory limitations, the effect of a dividend or dividends upon our financial strength ratings, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. See \"Dividends.\"\n\n64\n\n\nBecause we are a holding company and all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, dividends, distributions and other payments from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to fund operations and pay dividends. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any of our future debt or preferred equity securities or our subsidiaries. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of shares of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants may ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.\n\nThe exercise price for Metromile’s warrants that were assumed by us in connection with the Metromile Merger is $281.51 per share. The warrants may not be in the money prior to their expiration and, as such, they may expire worthless. These warrants are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “LMND-WS.”\n\nThe terms of the warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to the holders. The warrant agreement, as amended, between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, and us, as successor thereunder following the consummation of the Metromile Merger (the “Metromile Warrant Agreement”), provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants (as defined in the Metromile Warrant Agreement) to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. Such amendments could significantly diminish the value of the warrants, reduce the likelihood of them being exercised profitably, and ultimately result in the warrants expiring worthless.\n\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\n\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (excluding any Placement Warrants (as defined the Metromile Warrant Agreement) held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our common stock in the event the shares of our common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of our common stock equals or exceeds $342.01 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and the like) on each of 20 trading days within the 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeems the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise its redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force a warrant holder: (i) to exercise its warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for it to do so, (ii) to sell its warrants at the then-current market price when it might otherwise wish to hold its warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, will be substantially less than the market value of its warrants\n\n65\n\n\nConcentrated ownership of our common stock could limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. This concentration may create a risk of sudden changes in our common stock price.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp. beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 14.7% of our outstanding common stock, corresponding to 9.9% of the total voting rights in our Company under our Amended Charter. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of the Company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the sale by a major shareholder of a significant portion of their holdings (particularly entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp.) could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In November 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering all of the shares of our common stock then held by entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock or warrants may not be sustained, which may cause our common stock or warrants to trade at a discount from the public offering price and make it difficult for you to sell the common stock or warrants you purchase.\n\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will sustain a trading market on the NYSE and NYSE American or how active and liquid that market may remain. If an active and liquid trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock or warrants that you purchase at a price above the price you purchase it or at all. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to continue would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock or warrants. The market price of our common stock or warrants may decline below the public offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our markets, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could materially decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets, or our competitors. Analysts may not continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.\n\nItem 1B.     Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan, employee training, testing and assessments and a third party risk management process.\n\nOur program is informed by best practice approaches relevant to the technologies we use, the environments in which our services are designed and deployed, our business needs, and relevant regulatory requirements. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the various standards and frameworks as guides to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common approaches, reporting channels, and governance processes that apply the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n\n•Risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n\n•A security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n\n•The use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n\n•Security tools deployed in the IT environment for protection against and monitoring of suspicious events;\n\n•Security awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; \n\n•A cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n\n•A third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors who access our data and/or systems.\n\nWe have not identified known cybersecurity threats to date that could have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats such as loss or theft of data, disruptive attacks from financially motivated bad actors, and third party supply chain issues that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business.”\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as a critical part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management.\n\nThe Audit Committee periodically receives reports on our cybersecurity risks from our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) or his designee at least twice annually. In addition, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents or incidents with lesser impact potential.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly reports its activities, including those related to cybersecurity, to the full Board. The full Board also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management. As part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies, Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CISO or his designee.\n\nThe management team delegates responsibility for assessing and managing our cybersecurity risks to the CISO. The CISO has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any external cybersecurity consultants. The CISO has over two decades of security work that includes work for large global enterprises, managing global security teams, and establishing and running security programs for both conventional and high-tech companies, including publicly traded and regulated companies. The CISO reports to an internal security committee periodically regarding current security posture, risk, and trending security incidents and threats relevant to the Company. The security committee comprises key management personnel, department heads, and business unit leaders.  \n\nOur CISO supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which includes managing a security team and security tools, and as appropriate may include briefings from internal security personnel threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.",

You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, when investing in our common stock or warrants. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:\n\n•We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\n•Our success and ability to grow our business depend on retaining and expanding our customer base. If we fail to add new customers or retain current customers, our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\n\n•The \"Lemonade\" brand may not become as widely known as incumbents' brands or the brand may become tarnished.\n\n•Denial of claims or our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n•Our future revenue growth and prospects depend on attaining greater value from each user.\n\n•Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance, implementation of our business model, and our future prospects.\n\n•We may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\n\n•Our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to, which could cause us to write policies we should not write, price those policies inappropriately or overpay claims that are made by our customers.\n\n•Intense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to attain or increase profitability.\n\n•Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.\n\n•If we are unable to maintain and implement relationships with third-party service providers, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties are adversely impacted by financial, reputational, regulatory and other risks, our prospects for future growth and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n•If we are unable to expand our product offerings, or expand into new markets, our prospects for future growth may be adversely affected.\n\n•The novelty of our business model makes its efficacy unpredictable and susceptible to unintended consequences.\n\n•We could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Regulators may limit our ability to develop or implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•Existing and new legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n•The insurance business, including the market for renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n•We rely on artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes, and any legal or regulatory requirements that prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n•We may require additional capital to grow our business, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n•Security incidents or real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our systems, website or app could impair our operations, result in loss of personal customer information, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.\n\n•We are periodically subject to examinations by our primary state insurance regulators, which could result in adverse examination findings and necessitate remedial actions.\n\n•If we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\n•Our product development cycles are complex and subject to regulatory approval, and we may incur significant expenses before we generate revenues, if any, from new products.\n\n•Our expansion within the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\n•We are subject to extensive insurance industry regulations.\n\n•State insurance regulators impose additional reporting requirements regarding enterprise risk on insurance holding company systems, with which we must comply as an insurance holding company.\n\n•Severe weather events and other catastrophes, including the effects of climate change and global pandemics, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition.\n\n•Climate risks, including risks associated with disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n•Increasing scrutiny, actions and changing expectations from investors, clients, regulators, our employees and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may impose additional costs on us, impact our access to capital, or expose us to new or additional risks.\n\n•The impact of the Customer Investment Agreement with General Catalyst is unpredictable, and the arrangement may not function as expected, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality and volatility, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results or in perceptions of our business prospects.\n\n•We rely on data from our customers and third parties for pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, handling claims and maximizing automation, the unavailability or inaccuracy of which could limit the functionality of our products and disrupt our business.\n\n•Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to limitations in the analytical models used to assess and predict our exposure to catastrophe losses.\n\n•Our actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n•Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\n\n•We are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds, and mandatory state insurance facilities, which may affect our ability to achieve profitability.\n\n•As a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively impact our financial performance.\n\n•We conduct certain of our operations in Israel and therefore our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel and the surrounding region.\n\n4\n\n\nPART I\n\nItem 1. Business\n\nOverview\n\nLemonade is rebuilding insurance from the ground up on a digital substrate and an innovative business model. By leveraging technology, data, artificial intelligence, contemporary design, and social impact, we believe we are making insurance more delightful, more affordable, and more precise. To that end, we have built a vertically-integrated company with wholly-owned insurance carriers in the United States and Europe, including the UK and the full technology stack to power them.\n\nA brief chat with our bot, AI Maya, is all it takes to get covered with renters, homeowners, pet, car or life insurance, and we expect to offer a similar experience for other insurance products over time. Claims are filed by chatting with another bot, AI Jim, who pays claims in as little as two seconds. This breezy experience belies the extraordinary technology that enables it: a state-of-the-art platform that spans marketing to underwriting, customer care to claims processing, finance to regulation. Our architecture melds artificial intelligence with the human kind, and learns from the prodigious data it generates to become ever better at delighting customers and evaluating risk.\n\nIn addition to digitizing insurance end-to-end, we also reimagined the underlying business model to minimize volatility while maximizing trust and social impact. To lessen the volatility inherent in an industry directly impacted by the weather, we utilize several forms of reinsurance, with the goal of dampening the impact on our gross margin. The result is that excess claims are generally offloaded to reinsurers, while excess premiums can be donated to nonprofits selected by our customers as part of our annual \"Giveback\". These two ballasts, reinsurance and Giveback, reduce volatility, while creating an aligned, trustful, and values-rich relationship with our customers.\n\nOur Business Model\n\nAt the foundation of our business model is a direct, digital, customer-centric experience that enables rapid growth and strong retention. Our customer-centricity runs deep, and our underlying business model is designed to align interests between us and our customers. This technology-first customer acquisition and retention strategy, combined with our unconflicted business model, results in a highly attractive financial model.\n\nWe leverage technology in everything we do. AI Maya and our APIs sell 98% of Lemonade's policies. Approximately 95% of homeowners insurance policies in the United States are sold via agents, making a platform that finds, onboards, and digitally serves consumers end-to-end very much an outlier. Our digital substrate enables us to integrate marketing and onboarding with underwriting and claims processing, collecting and deploying data throughout, to constantly drive efficient customer acquisition, enhance the customer experience, and mitigate risk. This approach results in significant, rapid scaling coupled with high customer satisfaction.\n\nTo align our interests with those of our customers, encourage good behavior and build a long-term relationship based on mutual trust, we endeavor to decouple our financial incentives from variability in claims. Unlike many of our competitors, we work to minimize incentives to deny legitimate claims as we aim to give back, rather than pocket, leftover monies. Our reinsurance contracts serve to lessen volatility in our operating results, as a material portion of claims are borne by our reinsurance partners. See \"Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business”. In the future, reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAfter our customers purchase a policy, we ask them to designate a charitable cause for us to support. As a result, we believe customers are less inclined to embellish claims as they could be hurting a nonprofit they care about, rather than an insurance company they do not.\n\nStrong retention rates and a subscription-based model create highly-recurring and naturally-growing revenue streams, and provide visibility into our topline results. Our reinsurance construct, in turn, mitigates the bottom-line volatility inherent in traditional insurance companies, where profits quite literally depend on the weather. With our reinsurance agreements offloading residual claims, and our Giveback policy offloading residual premiums, we have two powerful ballasts that reduce volatility, while creating an aligned, trustful, and values-rich relationship with our customers.\n\n5\n\n\nThis combination of a customer-focused onboarding experience, a customer-aligned business model, and a revenue stream that grows along with our customers' insurance needs, has created a sustainable financial model that we are proud of. Over time, we believe our platform will continue to efficiently acquire new customers and give us the ability to service their growing needs at a lower cost, and with higher satisfaction levels, than the industry at large.\n\nOur Technology\n\nData Advantage\n\nOur proprietary and entirely integrated technology stack is a key enabler of our strategy and business model. Interactions with our customers across our platform generate a trove of data, which in turn improves interactions with our customers across our platform.\n\nAI Maya\n\nAI Maya, our playful onboarding and customer experience bot, uses natural language to guide customers through an easy and fun process of joining Lemonade. Maya handles everything from collecting information and personalizing coverage to creating quotes and facilitating payments securely. By asking customers a limited number of high-impact questions, and adapting based on their responses, AI Maya is able to dramatically reduce onboarding times while still collecting and utilizing the data that is central to our continuous improvement.\n\nAI Jim\n\nAI Jim is our claims bot, and, as of December 31, 2024, 96% of the time, it is AI Jim that will take the first notice of loss from a Lemonade customer without human intervention (and with zero claims overhead, known as loss adjustment expense, or “LAE”). As of December 31, 2024, roughly 55% of our claims were automated, resulting in instant or near-instant processing from start to finish. AI Jim triages and assigns claims he is not authorized to settle, or ones where he identifies concerns, to human claims experts, analyzing each expert's specialty, qualifications, workload, and schedule to determine to whom to assign the claim. Even where human escalation is needed, AI Jim will have done much of the heavy lifting so our team can settle claims and support customers in their hour of need as quickly and smoothly as possible.\n\nThe claims process represents the most acute pain point in the insurance experience, and it is where animosity toward the industry is most commonly cultivated. Re-imagining claims for the benefit of the customer, by aligning interests and incentives and by endeavoring to remove friction, hassle, cost, and delays, is therefore a key driver of our leadership in customer satisfaction.\n\nCX.AI\n\nCX.AI is our bot platform built to understand and resolve customer requests without human intervention. Currently, over half of Lemonade’s customer inquiries are handled this way. Customers often require assistance pre- or post-purchase, ranging from coverage questions to making changes to their policy, such as adding a spouse, updating coverage amounts, changing payment methods, or adding newly purchased items. CX.AI uses Natural Language Processing to analyze and understand customers' requests, helping them perform a growing set of tasks.\n\nOur customer-facing technologies, AI Maya, AI Jim, and CX.AI deliver a superior experience at a fraction of the cost, all the while collecting and utilizing far more data than their human counterparts. A similar construct powers the rest of the Company.\n\nOur 'behind the scenes technology' is structured within three proprietary applications: Forensic Graph, Blender, and Cooper.\n\n6\n\n\nForensic Graph\n\nForensic Graph utilizes the combined power of behavioral economics, big data, and AI to predict, deter, detect, and block fraud throughout the customer engagement. The FBI estimates that insurance fraud in the United States (excluding health insurance fraud) costs more than $40 billion per year in increased premiums. It is a complicated problem to solve for traditional insurers, mostly due to data paucity. Forensic Graph tracks untold signals and analyzes relationships between things which may appear trivial or invisible to humans, but in which our machine learning uncovers complex multivariate links that have helped us avoid millions of dollars' worth of potential losses.\n\nBlender\n\nBlender is a robust insurance management platform that we built with customer centricity and exponential efficiency in mind. This is a built-from-scratch, cutting edge backend system, designed as a single, cohesive, and streamlined management tool for our customer experience, underwriting, claims, growth, marketing, finance, and risk teams. When a claims experience specialist logs in to Blender, for example, they instantly see all claims assigned to them by AI Jim. Blender then provides them with instructions for next steps, and when possible, includes coverage determinations, and alerts of suspicious activity. Critically, they will also see an extraordinary amount of information about the users' behavior patterns and their claim, background information, risk indicators, insurance history, and much more. If a vendor is needed, for example, to assess the damage, all appropriate suppliers will pop up in Blender, and can be dispatched to the field, and paid, at the push of a button. Blender brings similar integrated, customer-centric, and focused workflows to the other Lemonade teams as well.\n\nCooper\n\nCooper is our internal bot (we like to think of him as our own Jarvis) who runs important parts of our Company. Cooper handles complex as well as repetitive tasks, from helping our customer experience team handle lengthy, manual processes such as processing paper checks, to automatically running tens of thousands of tests on each release of our software. Cooper continuously analyzes spectrometry imaging beamed from NASA's satellites, identifying wildfires in real time and blocking ads and sales in the affected areas; Cooper collates and formats materials for our regulatory filings; and he even handles most of our engineering task allocation, code deployment, Q&A, and more. Cooper makes our team dramatically more efficient and keeps evolving and learning with time.\n\nForensic Graph, Blender, and Cooper, together with AI Maya, AI Jim, and CX.AI, run atop our Customer Cortex. The Customer Cortex, like a central nervous system, is the place where all data about our customers is transmitted, continuously analyzed, and then used by all six applications.\n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nAcquire more customers\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, about 92% of our current home and renters customers said that they were not switching to Lemonade from another carrier. We are well positioned to grow our customer base by continuing to attract first time buyers, an underserved population replenishing every year.\n\nOur delightful experience and competitive pricing also attract customers who switch from their existing carriers. Our bot automatically files the necessary paperwork to cancel a customer's old policy, removing what is typically a barrier to switching. As we continue to strengthen brand recognition and execute our marketing strategy, we will look to increase the number of customers migrating to the Lemonade platform.\n\n7\n\n\nGrow within our existing customer base\n\nAs our customers move up the economic ladder and through lifecycle events, their insurance needs evolve to higher value products: renters typically acquire more property and frequently upgrade to successively larger homes. Growing households often need car, pet, and life insurance, and additional coverage. These progressions regularly trigger orders of magnitude jumps in insurance premiums, and within states that offer all of Lemonade’s “suite of products” - Renters, Home, Car, Pet, and Life - we see a growing proportion of customers with multiple Lemonade policies and see ripe opportunities for the business. For instance, we see an incredible opportunity for Lemonade Car in selling to our existing customers, allowing us to acquire customers at no cost. Of the more than 2.2 million customers we have today, about 1.2 million already have car insurance—that translates to a potential multi-billion dollar opportunity in car premiums at nearly zero acquisition costs. We aim to provide an unmatched user experience in order to retain customers throughout their lifespan, expanding their lifetime value without incurring any incremental costs of acquisition.\n\nExpand to new products\n\nOur strategy of growing with our customers also lends itself to expanding into new lines of insurance, as lifecycle events trigger the need for additional insurance products.\n\nOur regulatory framework, technology stack, and brand are all extensible to new lines of insurance, and we anticipate that these will contribute to our growth in the future. In the last four years, we have added life, pet and car insurance to our growing portfolio of offerings, and have expanded product offerings in France and the UK to include Buildings insurance, and expect to add additional coverage types over time.\n\n8\n\n\nExpand to new geographies\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we are licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in  50 states of the United States and Washington, D.C. We operate in 39 of those states and Washington, D.C., which collectively represent approximately 93% of the U.S. population. Our strong brand and unique business model drive rapid growth and allow us to quickly gain share in new markets. We also hold a pan-European license, enabling us to passport into and sell in 30 countries across Europe. Under this license we commenced operations in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October 2022, we began selling contents insurance in the United Kingdom (“UK”) in a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime. We expanded our offerings to include Buildings insurance in both France and the UK in April and July 2024, respectively. We also registered two UK branches: (i) Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch (“UK Branch”) and its affiliate (ii) Lemonade Agency B.V.. In May and June 2023 respectively, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for both of these registered branches allowing us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market.\n\nThe Lemonade platform is inherently multilingual and agile by design, so that we can efficiently expand into new markets and new product offerings both within the United States and internationally. \n\nOur Product Offerings\n\nRenters and Homeowners Insurance\n\nWe offer our products to renters and homeowners in the United States, France, and the UK (in addition to liability insurance for the latter two) and contents and liability insurance in Germany and the Netherlands. The insurance we offer in the United States covers stolen or damaged property, and also covers personal liability, which protects our customers if they are responsible for an accident or damage to another person or their property. In a number of states, we also offer landlord insurance policies to condo and co-op owners who rent out their property less than five times a year.\n\nIn 2024, we expanded our offerings to include Buildings insurance in the UK and France, giving homeowners throughout France and the UK the ability to purchase extensive coverage for their home and belongings. Both expansions were supported by existing partnerships with Aviva in the UK and BNP Paribas Cardif in France, providing coverage options unique to each locale through our fully digital experience. \n\nThe full Lemonade experience is available through our iOS and Android apps, as well as through our website. Before a customer purchases one of our policies, we allow the customer to review a summary of their coverage and a sample policy. We also enable the customer to reconfigure their coverage and other policy settings, such as the deductible and start date. After payment via a credit or debit card, we instantly issue the customer their policy documents and send it to them via email. From start to finish, the entire process is completed digitally.\n\nIn the U.S., our products automatically cover all residents of a household who are related to the customer by marriage, blood, or adoption. In addition to the base coverage we offer for personal property, electronics, furniture, and clothing, our customers can purchase extra coverage to protect against accidental loss, damage, and theft, worldwide, of their jewelry, fine art, and other personal property.\n\nPet Insurance\n\nWe currently offer pet insurance that covers diagnostics, procedures, medication, accidents or illness. Even our basic pet insurance offering covers blood tests, urinalysis, X-rays, MRIs, lab work, and CT scans. We also offer two optional add-ons to the basic plan, a wellness package and an extended accident and illness package. These provide additional coverage for preventative care costs, including annual exams and vaccines, and recovery treatments, including physical therapy and hydrotherapy.\n\n9\n\n\nWe believe our expansion into pet insurance will allow us to further achieve our long-term strategy of growing with our young customer base by offering new insurance experiences to customers as they progress in their lifecycles. Our leadership in leveraging AI has also allowed us to create a highly-efficient business. Since launching in 2020, our Pet book of business has increased more than 20x (in IFP), dropped 40 points off the loss ratio, and increased efficiencies by 70%, driving down the cost per claim from $65 to $19. About 83% of our pet insurance policies were sold to new customers, and about 6% of those have already added a renters or homeowners policy to their pet policy as of December 31, 2024. Customers that bundle our insurance offerings typically save money. The remaining 17% or so of pet insurance policies were sold to existing customers, whose median premium per customer grew roughly 3.7x with little to no incremental customer acquisition costs.\n\nCar\n\nWe launched car insurance in December 2021 in Illinois, and now offer it in nine states. Lemonade Car insurance covers car accidents, weather damage, theft and vandalism, damage from fire, trees, or animals, glass and windshield repair, liability for bodily injury and property damage, medical expenses, roadside assistance, and reimburses drivers for expenses relating to temporary transportation when a car is being repaired, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nIn July 2022, we announced the completion of the Metromile Acquisition, a pay-per-mile car insurance provider. As part of the transaction, we acquired a full-stack insurance entity with 49 state licenses plus Washington, D.C., and precision data from more than 500 million car trips. As of December 2024, we have substantially completed the migration of Metromile customers to the Lemonade platform.\n\nLife\n\nLemonade also provides life insurance through a partnership arrangement with a third-party carrier. With Lemonade’s term life insurance offering, individuals can apply online for up to $1.5 million or more in coverage, for a term of 10 to 40 years. Applicants use Lemonade’s interface to receive an initial quote estimate and then are transferred to our partner to complete their final application.\n\nGiveback Feature\n\nGiveback is a distinctive feature, whereby each year we aim to donate leftover money to causes our customers care about. After our customers purchase a policy, we ask them to select, from a pre-vetted list, a charitable cause to support with the residual premiums from their policy. Behind the scenes, customers who select the same charitable cause are classified as members of the same \"cohort.\" Once each year we review the loss ratio of each cohort, and provided that we pass the financial ratio tests required by our regulators, we aim to donate the funds remaining, if any, to the charitable cause selected by that cohort. Cohorts with a loss ratio above 40% usually will not receive a Giveback.\n\nThe Giveback is paid only if payment is authorized by our board of directors in its sole discretion and consistent with its duty of care. See \"Risk Factors — We could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\" Our 2024 Giveback for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2024 amounted to $2,112,608 hitting a milestone of more than $10 million donated since the program’s inception in 2017. We calculate our annual Giveback on each anniversary of our primary reinsurance contract. The Giveback is not a contractual obligation to any customer or to any cause, and customers may not take a tax deduction related to the donations.\n\n10\n\n\nWe have informed, and intend to continue to inform, our customers of the amount donated to their selected nonprofit during each Giveback on an annual basis, details of which follow:\n\nGivebackYearNumber of Nonprofit OrganizationsAmount\n\n202443$2,112,608 \n\n202358$2,008,847 \n\n202259$1,873,588 \n\n202165$2,303,381 \n\n202034$1,128,109 \n\nNonprofit organizations chosen by customers in 2024 included: Charity Water, New Story, Malala Fund, and many others. Although a new and untested concept, we believe that donating a portion of the money left over after paying claims to nonprofits will discourage fraud and promote greater trust between us and our customers. The Giveback program, and our underlying ethos, has also helped build an honest relationship with our consumers. They trust us, and they also become part of a community; our policyholders are helping others while covering their own valuables, insuring their home, or making sure their pet can afford vital medical care.\n\nOur Vertically Integrated Platform\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nOur goal is to increase brand awareness and the number of customers migrating to our platform by utilizing a number of marketing channels to aid our direct-to-consumer sales model. Our primary channel of advertisement is the internet, where we promote our ads and services through various media and social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. We also use the data generated in customer support interactions to constantly refine and improve our marketing campaigns. We conduct drip campaigns via email to follow up with those who have inquired about us or started the on-boarding process. Additionally, we enter into agreements with parties who have access to potential customers, including insurance agencies, apartment building owners, and property management companies.\n\nUnderwriting\n\nOur digital platform enables us to ask fewer questions of our customers but derive many times more data points from each customer interaction than our competitors. Applying machine learning to these data allows us to identify predictive patterns, and these inform our underwriting. Our underwriting process involves collecting this information, classifying and evaluating each individual risk exposure, assessing the impact of the risk on our existing portfolio, and pricing the risk accordingly. When we launched, and had no data of our own, pricing and underwriting were done using easily obtainable industry information. Due to the limitations of these data, customers appeared relatively undifferentiated. \n\nClaims Process\n\nPowered and driven by our technology, our claims process is conducted via our digital platform, which includes our iOS and Android mobile apps. Claims can be substantiated with receipts, notes of where and when the item was purchased, and in certain cases, police reports. We also ask the customer to record a video explaining their claim to enhance the claim review process. After the customer completes a claim report on our mobile app, the customer is asked to enter bank account information. If the claim is approved, a payment is issued and deposited directly into the customer's account. Claims are often paid or declined through our claims bot, AI Jim, within seconds.\n\nWhile a meaningful portion of simple theft and standard pet claims are paid almost instantly, in many cases the incident is also reviewed by a human before the claim is approved, and certain property damage claims or liability claims may take longer to settle. In an event that requires immediate assistance or temporary housing as a result of fire, ongoing water damage, or structural damage that leaves the customer's home exposed, we contact the customer to assess the situation and provide emergency services, such as water or fire damage cleanup, temporary housing, or a designated specialist.\n\n11\n\n\nReinsurance\n\nInsurance often produces businesses with highly recurring revenue streams, and hence predictable top lines, but with significant bottom-line volatility, as profits can literally fluctuate with the weather. Earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires and hurricanes strike with caprice, and can push an otherwise profitable business deep into the red with little or no warning.\n\nThe first-order consequence of this uncertainty is that insurers often see unwelcome swings in their results. The second-order consequence is that regulators require insurers to keep significant reserves to absorb these swings, making them capital intensive. We set out to architect our business to be at once capital-light and possessed of a predictable and growing gross margin. Through judicious use of \"reinsurance,\" we believe we have largely achieved these goals.\n\nReinsurance is a financial instrument under which one insurer, the \"reinsurer,\" agrees to cover a portion of the claims of another insurer, the \"primary insurer,\" in return for a portion of their premiums. While this description characterizes all reinsurance, implementations come in different flavors, each with its own costs and benefits. We have entered into a range of reinsurance agreements, differing in both duration and terms, which combine, we believe, to deliver maximum capital efficiency, while optimizing our gross margin for both stability and size.\n\nProportional Reinsurance: Maximize Capital Efficiency\n\nThe low cost of capital for reinsurance companies creates an opportunity to share premiums and maintain our gross margin while dramatically reducing our capital requirements. We maintain proportional reinsurance contracts which cover all of the Company’s products and geographies, and transfers, or “cedes”, a specified percentage of the premium to reinsurers (“Proportional Reinsurance Contracts”).\n\nUnder U.S. and E.U. regulatory laws, insurance companies are required to set aside \"surplus capital\" in accordance with various formulae. These requirements tend to be more onerous for younger companies experiencing rapid growth, such that without reinsurance we would need to reserve as much as 50 cents for every dollar of premiums sold. Our proportional reinsurance structure shifts most of that surplus capital requirement to the reinsurer, reducing these capital requirements significantly.\n\nNon-Proportional Reinsurance: Optimize Gross Margin\n\nAs described above, our Proportional Reinsurance Contracts provide that we cede a significant portion of our premiums to our reinsurers, pushing our capital efficiency to near maximized levels. We have opted to manage the remaining portion of our business with alternative forms of reinsurance, with a view to maximizing profitability.\n\nThese two remaining goals live in tension with one another: leaving zero \"wiggle room\" around our fixed fee would guarantee its stability, but would preclude our benefiting from our improving loss ratio. Conversely, any room for improved profitability would also introduce additional volatility into our business.\n\nTo balance our desire for both growing and stable gross margin, we set out to structure our remaining reinsurance such that variability in our gross margin will be largely contained, though not eliminated entirely. We believe we have achieved this through a combination of reinsurance structures known as \"per risk reinsurance\" and \"facultative reinsurance\" (the \"Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts\"). Together, these contracts reduce the maximum amount we would need to pay for any one claim.\n\nOur business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes which are inherently unpredictable. To reduce this risk, we also purchase one year property catastrophe excess protection.\n\nIn 2023, we formed a new risk-bearing entity, Lemonade Re SPC, in the Cayman Islands, where we hold some of our retained risk. We also established a captive cell facility at a Bermuda transformer vehicle that is authorized to write and purchase insurance / reinsurance where we retain most of our windstorm exposure.\n\nWe believe our reinsurance structure achieves these important goals: making us capital-light, buffering our gross margin from the vicissitudes of claims, and leaving room for our gross margin to grow.\n\n12\n\n\nDuration\n\nOur goal of maximizing predictability of our results, while growing gross margin over time, led us to vary not only the terms of our reinsurance agreements, but their term, too.\n\nThe Proportional Reinsurance Contracts are issued by a consortium of three reinsurers, including Hannover Ruck SE, MAPFRE Re (Spain), and Swiss Re America (US), each holding an ‘A’ or better rating from A.M. Best, and each holding a share of the agreement’s commitments. In addition, we established a Cayman Islands-based captive reinsurer to which Metromile Insurance Company (“MIC”) cedes approximately 25% of its premiums and losses. \n\nOur Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts are issued by a collection of reinsurers, each holding an ‘A’ or better rating from A.M. Best, have a one-year term that expires on June 30, 2025. We also have a reinsurance contract between Lemonade Insurance Company (“LIC”) and a Bermuda-based segregated cell insurer to cover catastrophe risks over the initial $50,000,000 limit for each loss occurrence, and further subject to a limit of $80,000,000 for each loss occurrence and in aggregate.\n\nWe estimate that approximately half of our book is reinsured through June 30, 2025, and renewed and renegotiated on an annual basis. We believe that the terms of our reinsurance arrangements provide an appropriate balance between maximizing predictability, and enabling us to capture more margin over time.\n\nInvestments\n\nOur portfolio of investable assets is primarily held in cash, money market funds, and fixed income securities which includes U.S. and non-US government and government agencies obligations, corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities with relatively short durations. We manage the portfolio in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by the board of directors.\n\nWe have designed our investment policy and objectives to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital, and liquidity requirements of our operations setting guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate. Furthermore, our investment policy prohibits investments in areas such as oil and gas, coal, tobacco, controversial weapons, and non-compliance with the United Nations Global Compact. The policy, which may change from time to time, is approved by the board of directors and is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the policy evolves in response to changes in the financial markets. See \"Note 4 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe homeowners, pet, car and, to a lesser extent, the renters insurance industries in which we operate are highly competitive. While we believe we are well positioned to execute our business model and reinvent insurance, we face significant competition from traditional insurance companies such as Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, GEICO, Progressive and Travelers. Although we are tapping into markets that our competitors have struggled to reach, the incumbent insurance companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, higher financial ratings, greater resources, additional access to capital. In particular, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase homeowners and multiple other types of insurance products and \"bundle\" them together, and in certain circumstances, to include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond renters and homeowners insurance, pet and car insurance, we may face intense competition from traditional insurance companies that are already established in such markets. Competitors in the pet insurance space include companies such as Nationwide, Embrace, and Trupanion. Competitors in the car insurance space include companies such as Progressive, GEICO and Allstate.\n\nWe also compete with new market entrants. Competition is based on many factors, including the reputation and experience of the insurer, coverages offered, pricing and other terms and conditions, customer service, relationships with brokers and agents (including ease of doing business, service provided, and commission rates paid), size, and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors, and have developed a digital platform and business model based on artificial intelligence and behavioral economics that we believe will be difficult for incumbent insurance providers to emulate.\n\n13\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We intend to rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention of work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have 5 issued patents in the United States. The issued patents generally relate to determining the route and parking location of a vehicle, recording trip data associated with a vehicle, and estimating the usage of a vehicle based on refueling events. The issued patents are expected to expire between September 1, 2035 and January 11, 2036. We do not own any foreign patents and do not have any foreign patent applications pending. As of December 31, 2024, we hold 137 foreign registered trademarks and 10 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Lemonade and Metromile marks, have 4 foreign trademark applications pending and no U.S. trademark applications pending, and hold 3 copyrights in the United States, covering certain videos, texts, photographs, and artwork displayed on our mobile apps and website. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of intellectual property.\n\nIntellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.\n\nCertified B Corp Status\n\nWhile not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have been designated as a Certified B Corp. The term \"Certified B Corp\" does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.\n\nThe first step in becoming a Certified B Corp is completing a comprehensive and objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment varies depending on the company's size (number of employees), and sector. The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corp.\n\nBy completing a set of over 200 questions that reflect impact indicators, best practices, and outcomes, a company receives a composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees, customers, communities, and the environment. Representative indicators in the assessment range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community service, and use of renewable energy.\n\nRecognition as a Certified B Corp currently requires that a company achieve a reviewed assessment score of at least 80. The review process includes a phone review and a random selection of indicators for purposes of verifying documentation. The assessment also includes a corporate structure review and a disclosure questionnaire, including certain practices, fines, and sanctions related to the company or its partners.\n\nOur certification also required us to adopt the public benefit corporation structure, a step we have already completed. Once certified, every Certified B Corp must make its assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website. Acceptance as a Certified B Corp and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent nonprofit organization.\n\n14\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 1,235 employees, 796 of whom were based in the United States and the rest of whom were based outside of the United States, primarily in Israel and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, certain employees are subject to a collective agreement between the Dutch Association of Insurers and various trade unions. The collective agreement covers wages and terms and conditions of employment. Participation in the collective agreement is mandatory for members of the Dutch Association of Insurers, a leading association of private insurance companies operating in the Netherlands. Beyond this, to our knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, and based on public information from five competing insurance companies in the United States, we estimate that the number of customers per employee for those companies ranges from approximately 150 to approximately 450 customers per employee. We base this estimate on publicly available information, which we have adjusted for comparability. The calculation of \"employees\" includes insurance agents and brokers because they are a significant cost component for other insurance companies. In comparison to these competitors, our number of customers per employee was approximately 2,000 as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCulture and Values\n\nOur status as a Certified B Corp and our commitment to charitable giving, in particular our Giveback program, distinguishes us from our competitors, with the goal of building a trusting relationship between us, our employees, and our customers. We value the power of creativity and encourage and support the sharing of ideas to enhance our business model. Like the industry in which we operate, we understand the importance and value of a community pooling its resources together for the public good. We value inclusivity, respecting differences, and seamless teamwork in every facet of our business.\n\nIn 2020, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock as the initial endowment of the Lemonade Foundation, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization established under Arizona law. By contributing approximately 1% of our common stock to the Lemonade Foundation, we hope to promote charitable giving and other community-centric activities with a nexus to our community.\n\nIn 2023, the Foundation launched a first of its kind blockchain-based insurance product for the world’s most vulnerable farmers. The product was built with a goal of protecting subsistence farmers against the effects of climate change. Thousands of families in Kenya have already been protected by this product, and the Foundation expects to continue scaling this product in the coming years. The product was launched as part of the Lemonade Foundation Crypto Climate Coalition - in cooperation with a number of strategic partners, including Hannover Re, Pula, Chainlink, Avalanche, Etherisc and DAOstack.\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nWe understand that strength lies in the unique backgrounds of our employees and drives the innovation behind our product. We encourage employees to bring their lived experiences, and personal strengths, to develop new ideas, improve customer experiences and shape our brand. We engage with employees for ideas of nonprofits to partner with, or resources to learn more about a social issue, and their candid (and anonymous, should they choose) feedback about our workplace culture and environment. Additionally, our employees organize several education groups across the Company addressing these importantt topics.\n\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\n\nAs a B Corp, it is part of our legal mission to advance the health, well-being and equity of employees. To that end, employees have access to health and wellness programs, and healthcare plans.\n\n15\n\n\nGeographic Scope of Business\n\nIn the United States, as of December 31, 2024, LIC and MIC are licensed to sell our insurance products in the following states:\n\nWe also currently hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe. Under this license, we commenced operations in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October 2022, we began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross-border basis under the UK's Temporary Permission Regime. During 2023 Lemonade's UK branch establishments received a third country branch authorization from the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority in the UK allowing us to operate in the UK permanently.\n\nSeasonality\n\nFor information regarding the seasonality of our business, please refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report.\n\n16\n\n\nRegulation of our Business\n\nInsurance Regulation\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. State insurance laws and regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of customers, consumers, and claimants rather than stockholders or other investors. State regulation generally have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of the insurance business. The regulatory requirements and restrictions include, among others, the following:\n\n•approval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\n•approval for intercompany service agreements;\n\n•advertising, marketing, and trade practices; and\n\n•restrictions on the ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or enter into certain related party transactions\n\nRegulation of insurance companies constantly changes as governmental agencies and legislatures react to real or perceived issues. Recently, state insurance regulators have been scrutinizing the industry’s practices with respect to the collection and uses of consumer data.\n\nRequired Licensing\n\nOur regulated U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and admitted in the states of New York and Delaware. Under a provision of the California Insurance Code, MIC is deemed “commercially domiciled” in California, meaning that the California Department of Insurance is entitled to regulate certain aspects of MIC’s business as if it were actually domiciled in California.\n\nLIC, MIC, Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC, Lemonade Life Insurance Agency, LLC, Lemonade E&S Insurance Agency, LLC and Metromile Insurance Services LLC must apply for and maintain licenses to provide and sell insurance in those jurisdictions in which they transact insurance businesses.\n\nOur insurance company and insurance producer subsidiaries are required to adhere to myriad laws and regulatory requirements. The insurance regulators in the states in which our subsidiaries do the business of insurance are empowered to conduct on-site visits and examine the financial affairs and market conduct practices of those entities. Insurance regulators have broad administrative powers to impose monetary penalties and/or restrict or revoke licenses to transact business for violations of applicable laws and regulations.\n\nRestrictions on Paying Dividends\n\nWe are a holding company that transacts a majority of our business through operating subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and meet our debt payment obligations is largely dependent on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. Applicable insurance laws restrict the ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. Applicable insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus.\n\nInsurance regulators have broad powers to prevent reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends of the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted to be made by our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by our regulated insurance subsidiaries may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect.\n\n17\n\n\nInvestment Regulation\n\nLIC is subject to New York’s insurance laws and MIC is subject to Delaware and California’s laws regarding the composition of their investments. Those laws generally require diversification of their investment portfolios and limits on the amount of their investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require those companies to sell those investments. \n\nLicensing of Our Employees and Adjusters\n\nIn most states in which we operate, insurance claims adjusters are required to be licensed and some must fulfill annual continuing education requirements. In most instances, our employees who are negotiating coverage terms are underwriters and are not required to be licensed agents. As of December 31, 2024, 422 employees were required to maintain and did maintain requisite licenses for these activities in most states in which we operate.\n\nEnterprise Risk, Cybersecurity, and Other Recent Developments\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of U.S. state insurance regulators to monitor U.S. insurance holding company groups. Among other things, the NAIC’s model, when adopted, requires the ultimate controlling person of an insurance company to submit an annual enterprise risk management report that describes the risk that an activity, circumstance, event, or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer will, if not remedied promptly, be likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Recently, the NAIC has developed model laws requiring annual reports concerning the nature of corporate governance within an insurance holding company.\n\nIn 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act (the “ORSA Model Act”) to require domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and the insurance group of which it is a member. When the ORSA Model Act is adopted by a particular state, it imposes more extensive filing requirements on parents and affiliates of domestic insurers. Delaware has adopted its version of the ORSA Model Act and New York has implemented portions of the ORSA Model Act.\n\nIn the course of our business, we collect and maintain confidential and personal information. As a result, we are subject to U.S. federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations that, among other things, require that we institute and maintain certain policies and procedures to safeguard this information from improper use or disclosure. For example, in 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS\") adopted a broad cybersecurity regulation that requires financial services institutions to, among other things, implement and maintain a cybersecurity program and a cybersecurity policy that will be monitored and tested periodically, develop controls and technology standards for data protection, meet minimum standards in response to any cybersecurity breach and annually certify their compliance with the regulation. On November 1, 2023, the NYDFS issued a significant amendment to the cybersecurity requirements, mandating covered entities to adopt specific standards and controls to secure sensitive data. The recent amendment significantly expands obligations on entities regulated by NYDFS to report cybersecurity incidents and enhance their consumer data protection and cybersecurity infrastructure. Regulated entities are generally required to comply with the new requirements imposed by the Amendment in phases throughout 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which established standards for data security and for the investigation and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. Many states have enacted the Insurance Data Security Model Law or similar laws, and we expect more states to follow.\n\n18\n\n\nAdditionally, a growing set of privacy regulations have created intense scrutiny regarding Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, academics, and commercial interests in the United States and abroad that focus on consumer data protection and privacy. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information about consumers’ online browsing and mobile app usage activity. It is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions, and the applicable choices we offer consumers.\n\nCalifornia has enacted legislation restricting the use of automated systems to communicate with people online. California enacted a statute making it unlawful for any person to use a bot to communicate with another person in California online with the intent to mislead the other person about its artificial identity for the purpose of knowingly deceiving the person about the content of the communication in order to incentivize a purchase or sale of goods or services in a commercial transaction. The statute provides that a person using a bot will not be liable under the statute if the person discloses that it is a bot. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — New legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.”\n\nGDPR\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679 (the “E.U. GDPR”) applies to our activities to the extent that those activities take place in the context of our establishments in the European Union, and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the “UK GDPR”) applies to our activities to the extent that those activities take place in the context of our establishments in the UK (EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the  “GDPR”). In addition, the GDPR may apply to our activities that involve the processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union or UK to whom we offer our products or services. The GDPR could also apply to our business if we were to monitor the activities of individuals in the European Union or UK. As we expand into Europe or UK, the compliance obligations under the GDPR (as set out above) will become more significant. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks as we continue to expand into Europe and the UK. in connection with the GDPR, UK GDPR and other data protection regulations.”\n\nFederal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes\n\nA number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program.\n\nCredit for Reinsurance\n\nState insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws. There are several different ways in which the credit for reinsurance laws may be satisfied by an assuming reinsurer, including being licensed in the state, being accredited in the state, or maintaining certain types of qualifying collateral. We ensure that LIC and MIC are able to take full financial statement credit for their reinsurance.\n\n19\n\n\nInsolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools, and Insurance Facilities\n\nMost states require admitted property and casualty insurance companies to become members of insolvency funds or associations which generally protect customers against the insolvency of the admitted insurance companies. Members of the fund or association must contribute to the payment of certain claims made against insolvent insurance companies through annual assessments. The annual assessments required in any one year will vary from state to state, and are subject to various maximum assessments per line of insurance.\n\nRisk-Based Capital\n\nRisk-based capital laws are designed to assess the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations and to ensure that it has an acceptably low expectation of becoming financially impaired. State insurance regulators use risk-based capital ratios to set capital requirements, considering the size and degree of risk taken by the insurer and taking into account various risk factors including asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk, and interest rate risk. As the ratio of an insurer’s total adjusted capital and surplus decreases relative to its risk-based capital, the risk-based capital laws provide for increasing levels of regulatory intervention culminating with mandatory control of the operations of the insurer by the domiciliary insurance department at the so-called mandatory control level. Our regulators in New York, Delaware and California require annual reporting to confirm that LIC and MIC hold in excess of the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for their operations. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. Failure to maintain risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of LIC and MIC to maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to conduct their businesses. As of December 31, 2024, LIC maintained a risk-based capital level of 577% and MIC maintained a risk-based capital level of 525%.\n\nIRIS Ratios\n\nThe NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) is a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS consists of two phases: statistical and analytical. In the statistical phase, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements. The statistical phase highlights those insurers that merit the highest priority in the allocation of the state insurance regulators’ resources. The ratios are not, in themselves, indicative of adverse financial conditions. The analytical phase is a review of the annual statements, financial ratios, and other automated solvency tools. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios for any number of reasons and a ratio falling outside the prescribed \"usual range\" is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. The primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention.\n\nStatutory Accounting Principles\n\nStatutory accounting principles (“SAP”) is a basis of accounting developed by U.S. insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer’s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to customers. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles and related regulations determine, among other things, the amounts our regulated insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as dividends and differ somewhat from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which are designed to measure a business on a going-concern basis. GAAP gives consideration to matching of revenue and expenses and, as a result, certain expenses are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. The valuation of assets and liabilities under GAAP is based in part on best estimate assumptions made by the insurer. Stockholders’ equity represents both amounts currently available and amounts expected to emerge over the life of the business. As a result, the values for assets, liabilities, and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP may be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.\n\n20\n\n\nRate Regulation\n\nNearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.\n\nThe speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. \n\nAn insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is dependent on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.\n\nFrom time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates.\n\nEuropean Regulation\n\nOur European insurance entities consist of Lemonade Insurance N.V., Lemonade Agency B.V., their respective UK branch undertakings, and Lemonade B.V.. We also establish and maintain an entity for the provision of intercompany support services; Lemonade Technology B.V.. Lemonade Insurance N.V. is a licensed non-life insurer established in the Netherlands and is subject to key financial rules and regulations including the Second European Solvency Directive 2009/138/EC (as amended, the “Solvency II Directive”); Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (as amended, the “Delegated Regulation”, together with the Solvency II Directive referred to as the “Solvency II Regulations”); the implementing technical standards and regulatory technical standards issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”); the European Insurance Distribution Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/97, “IDD”); the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht, “DFSA”) and the lower rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (\"IFRS EU\"); and national regulations, as well as local conduct of business requirements, in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Currently, the European Commission is preparing for a review of the Solvency II Directive. Lemonade Agency B.V. is subject to the IDD, the DFSA and national regulations, as well as local business conduct requirements and consumer laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Lemonade B.V. is an insurance holding company within the meaning of article 212 of the Solvency II Directive, as implemented in article 1:1 DFSA.\n\nSince 2022, Lemonade has operated in the UK market and is therefore also subject to relevant UK regulation including the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), the Insurance Act 2015, and relevant subsidiary regulations. By virtue of its authorisation and oversight by both the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) in the UK, Lemonade is also subject to the regulatory requirements of the PRA Rulebook and the FCA Handbook respectively as they pertain to Insurers, distributing agents and financial service providers generally.\n\n21\n\n\nThe Solvency II Regulations\n\nThe Solvency II Directive, as implemented in the DFSA and other national regulations, such as the German Insurance Supervisory Act (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz), prescribes uniform rules for insurers and their activities and services. More specifically, the Solvency II Directive provides rules and regulations relating to, inter alia, Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s authorization requirements (including the European “passport” regime), its minimum own funds and solvency and its governance. Governance requirements include the need to ensure sound business operations, implement mandatory key functions (including Actuarial, Compliance, Internal Audit and Risk) and requirements relating to Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s Management Board members, Supervisory Board Members and other key personnel. The Delegated Regulation is promulgated under the Solvency II Directive and provides detailed requirements relating to some of the Solvency II Directive’s broader requirements.\n\nIDD and other conduct of business rules\n\nThe IDD provides a harmonized regime for insurance distribution activities. It regulates the way insurance products are designed and sold both by insurance intermediaries (e.g. Lemonade Agency B.V.) and directly by insurance undertakings (e.g. Lemonade Insurance N.V.). The rules and regulations set out in the IDD have been implemented in the DFSA. The provisions set out in the IDD mainly relate to standards of product disclosure, promotional materials and product governance and oversight. Local regulations and conduct of business rules implemented in each of the European member states in which both Lemonade Agency B.V. and Lemonade Insurance N.V. do business supplement the requirements set out in the IDD.\n\nFinancial and other Regulators\n\nLemonade Insurance N.V. is subject to primary supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, “DNB”) as the supervisory authority of its home member state. In addition, it is subject to supervision by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, “AFM”). The AFM is the regulator tasked with conduct supervision relating to Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s Dutch activities. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, “BaFin”), as the supervisory authority of a host member state. BaFin is the competent regulator tasked with the supervision of Lemonade Insurance N.V.’s compliance with German regulations and conduct requirements. The French Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, \"ACPR\", which is charged with preserving the stability of the financial system and protecting the customers, insurance policyholders, members and beneficiaries of the persons that it supervises, and Organisme pour le Registre des Intermédiaires en Assurance, \"ORIAS\", an association under the supervision of the Treasury Department in France and in charge of approving insurance intermediaries operating on the French market; the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority in charge of prudentially regulating and supervising financial services firms operating in the UK; the British Financial Conduct Authority, whose role includes protecting consumers, keeping the industry stable, and promoting healthy competition between financial service providers.\n\nLemonade Agency B.V. is subject to supervision by the AFM. Lemonade B.V., as parent, and Lemonade Insurance N.V., as subsidiary, is an E.U. sub-group within the meaning of Article 213(2)(b) of Solvency II, as implemented in article 3:285 (2) DFSA. Lemonade B.V. is subject to group supervision by DNB under the Solvency II Directive. The relevant EU supervisory body for insurers, EIOPA, has limited supervisory powers in the Netherlands, however it plays an important role in drafting and issuing technical standards and preparing guidance relating to various European directives and regulations. EIOPA aims to accomplish efficient and harmonized financial supervision across the European Union.\n\nDNB and AFM employ a risk-based and proportionate approach to supervision, comprising a firm systemic framework, which focuses on the continuous assessment of how firms manage the risks they create and identifying the root causes of risk. DNB regularly pro-actively contacts insurers to discuss matters of strategy, day-to-day operations and the current (and expected future) financial standing of the undertaking, in order to assess what parts of a regulated undertaking, if any, which could pose systemic risks. In addition, DNB monitors operations and business through monthly updates, the submission of Quantitative Reporting Templates, by reviewing annual reports, approving prospective Management Board and Supervisory Board members prior to their appointment and through scheduled and unannounced audits.\n\n22\n\n\nDNB also regulates the acquisition and increase of control over certain authorized firms, including insurers. Under the DFSA, any person intending to acquire control of, or increase (or decrease) control over, an insurer must first obtain the consent of the DNB. In considering whether to grant or withhold its approval for the acquisition of control, DNB must be satisfied that the acquirer is a fit and proper person and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by their acquisition of, or increase in, control. A person will be treated as increasing (or decreasing) their control over an insurer if the level of their percentage of (indirect) shareholding or voting power in the insurer crosses the 10, 20, 33, 50 percent or 100 percent thresholds.\n\nBoth Lemonade Insurance N.V. and Lemonade Agency B.V. commenced operations in the UK under the Temporary Permission Regime in accordance with which certain European Economic Area based firms may continue to operate in the UK for a limited period following the UK's departure from the European Union. During 2023, the UK branch establishments of Lemonade Insurance N.V., and Lemonade Agency B.V. (“UK branch establishments”) received a third country branch authorization in the UK allowing both companies to continue to operate in the UK market on a permanent basis. Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch (BR024862) is the UK establishment of Lemonade Agency B.V.. Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK branch (BR025196), is the UK establishment of Lemonade Insurance N.V.. See Required Licensing section below for a description.\n\nEnforcement\n\nDNB and AFM expect firms to avoid actions that jeopardize compliance with their statutory objectives and applicable rules and regulations and have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated firm. When DNB is concerned that an insurer may present a risk, this may lead to negative consequences, including the requirement to maintain a higher level of regulatory capital (via capital “add-ons” under the Solvency II Directive) to match the higher perceived risks and enforcement action where the risks identified breach applicable rules and regulations. In case of a breach of our license requirements or obligations arising from the applicable rules and regulations, although both DNB and AFM must apply the principle of proportionality in all of their actions, the regulators have a large amount of discretion in determining what measures to impose, if any, in order to address, remedy, or sanction the breach. DNB and the AFM have a large amount of enforcement tools at their disposal to sanction breaches of applicable rules and regulations, including public formal warnings, orders to adopt a certain course of conduct, incremental penalties, and administrative fines. In addition, breaches may lead to a revocation of an undertaking license and, in the case of insurers, where the breach relates to material prudential shortcomings, DNB may impose emergency measures, including the appointment of an administrator or the imposition of measures aimed at winding-up the undertaking).\n\nRequired Licensing\n\nOur subsidiary Lemonade Insurance N.V. is licensed and supervised by the insurance supervision division of DNB as a Solvency II non-life insurance company. DNB, as the supervisory authority of its home member state, has permitted us to sell in other European countries, such as Germany and France, on a Freedom of Services basis. In general, in addition to continuing to meet the threshold conditions to authorization, Lemonade Insurance N.V. and Lemonade Agency B.V. are obliged to comply with European regulations, European directives (in as far as these directives have direct effect in the Netherlands or other European member states in which our subsidiaries do business), the DFSA and the lower regulations set out thereunder, and other national regulations, all of which contain detailed rules covering, among other things, systems and controls, conduct of business, and prudential (i.e. capital and solvency) requirements.\n\nLemonade Insurance N.V. launched its first product in the UK market in October 2022, and operates in the UK through its registered branch establishment, Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch (BR025196) which received third-country branch authorization from the Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK in May 2023. This allows the company to operate in the UK market permanently. Lemonade Insurance N.V. is licensed as an insurance company by De Nederlandsche Bank in the Netherlands (R162036). Authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority. Subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority and limited regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (FRN 846181).\n\nLemonade Agency B.V. commenced operations in the UK under the TPR as described above, and received third country branch authorisation through its registered branch establishment Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch (BR024862) in 2023. Lemonade Agency B.V., UK Branch is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN: 989294).\n\n23\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOur internet website address is www.lemonade.com.

Risk Factors\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\nWe have not been profitable since our inception in 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $1,298.8 million and $1,096.6 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of $202.2 million and $236.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We expect to make significant investments to further develop and expand our business. In particular, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on marketing and advertising as part of our strategy to increase our customer base. The marketing and advertising expenses that we incur are typically expensed immediately while any revenues that they generate are recognized ratably over the 12-month term of each insurance policy that we write. This timing difference can therefore result in expenses that exceed the related revenue generated in any given year. As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We expect that our net loss will increase in the near term as we continue to make such investments to grow our business. Despite these investments, we may not succeed in increasing our revenue on the timeline that we expect or in an amount sufficient to lower our net loss and ultimately become profitable. Moreover, if our revenue declines, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner because many of our costs are fixed in the short term. In addition, if we reduce variable costs to respond to losses, this may limit our ability to sign up new customers and grow our revenues. Accordingly, we may not achieve or maintain profitability and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\n\nOur success and ability to grow our business depend on retaining and expanding our customer base. If we fail to add new customers or retain current customers, our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\n\nWe have experienced significant customer growth since we commenced operations; however, we may not be able to maintain this growth and thus, our customer base could stop growing or even shrink over time.\n\nOur ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers depends, in large part, on our ability to continue to be perceived as providing delightful and superior insurance-buying and claims- filing customer experiences, competitive pricing, and adequate insurance coverage. In order to maintain this perception, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and advertising expenses, costs related to improving our service, and lower margins in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers. If we fail to remain competitive on customer experience, pricing, and insurance coverage options, our ability to grow our business and generate revenue by attracting and retaining customers may be adversely affected.\n\nThere are many factors that could negatively affect our ability to grow our customer base, including if:\n\n•we fail to effectively use search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content- based online advertising, and other online sources for generating traffic to our website and our online app;\n\n•potential customers in a particular marketplace or generally do not meet our underwriting guidelines;\n\n•our competitors mimic our digital platform, causing current and potential customers to purchase their insurance products instead of our products;\n\n•our digital platform experiences disruptions;\n\n•we experience unfavorable shifts in customer perception of our chat-bots;\n\n•we suffer reputational harm to our brand resulting from negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate;\n\n•we fail to expand geographically;\n\n•we fail to offer new and competitive products;\n\n•customers have difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing our app or website on mobile devices or web browsers as a result of actions by us or third parties;\n\n•technical or other problems frustrate the customer experience, particularly if those problems prevent us from generating quotes or paying claims in a fast and reliable manner; or\n\n25\n\n\n•we are unable to address customer concerns regarding the content, privacy, and security of our digital platform.\n\nOur inability to overcome these challenges could impair our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe \"Lemonade\" brand may not become as widely known as incumbents' brands or the brand may become tarnished.\n\nMany of our competitors have brands that are well recognized. As a relatively new entrant into the insurance market, we spend considerable money and other resources to create brand awareness and build our reputation. We may not be able to build brand awareness, and our efforts at building, maintaining and enhancing our reputation could fail. Complaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to consumers or business partners, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, whether valid or not, could diminish confidence in our brand, which could adversely affect our reputation and business. As we expand our product offerings and enter new markets, we need to establish our reputation with new customers, and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets could be adversely affected. We may not be able to maintain or enhance our reputation, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nDenial of claims or our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the efficacy of our artificial intelligence claims processing, the training and experience of our claims adjusters, including our third-party claims administrators, and our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions.\n\nThe speed by which our artificial intelligence technology allows us to process and pay claims is a differentiating factor for our business and an increase in the average time to process claims could undermine our reputation and position in the insurance marketplace. Any failure to pay claims accurately or timely could also lead to regulatory and administrative actions or material litigation, or result in damage to our reputation, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\nIf our claims adjusters or third party claims administrators are unable to effectively process our volume of non-automated claims, our ability to grow our business while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction could be compromised, which in turn, could adversely affect our operating margins.\n\nOur future revenue growth and prospects depend on attaining greater value from each customer.\n\nOur future growth and prospects depend on our ability to increase the premium per customer, as described in the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Currently, the large majority of our customers are renters. In order to increase our premium per customer, we must increase the number of higher-priced customers, such as homeowners, and the proportion of higher-priced customers relative to lower-priced customers, such as renters. Our business model is premised on the expectation that a significant number of our customers that are renters will continue to retain coverage with us as they move from being renters to homeowners. Currently, however, given our limited operating history, substantially all of our current homeowner users are new customers who were not previously renters with us. The purchase of a home is a significant event in a person's life and we cannot provide assurances that we will succeed in retaining existing customers that are renters as they become homeowners. This may occur for a variety of factors. For example, at the time a renter purchases a home, he or she is exposed to a large number of service providers who have direct and personal access to that renter in a way that we do not. Those service providers may have, and share, their own views and preferences for homeowners insurance. Furthermore, given the expenditure involved in a home purchasing decision, differences in price between our insurance product and that of our competitors may appear less significant. In addition, there may even be a perception that a higher priced policy from a traditional brand name insurer may be of higher quality when coupled with the size and longevity of such traditional insurers. A failure to \n\n26\n\n\nretain renters as they transition to homeowner status may materially adversely impact our future growth and prospects. Moreover, we also sell homeowner policies directly, or indirectly through independent insurance agencies, to customers who did not previously have a renters policy with us. To the extent we are unable to sell homeowner policies directly or via our insurance agency partners to new customers either now or in the future, our ability to increase our premium per customer would be negatively impacted, which could materially adversely impact our future growth and prospects.\n\nThe novelty of our business model makes its efficacy unpredictable and susceptible to unintended consequences.\n\nOur business model is predicated on behavioral economics. Under our model, excess premiums can be donated to nonprofits selected by our customers as part of our annual 'Giveback'. We designed our business model to attract customers, align our incentives with those customers, discourage fraudulent claims and allow us to offer competitive pricing, but it may not operate as intended over time and on a larger scale. For example:\n\n•Our commitment to charitable giving through our Giveback program may not align our interests with those of our customers or prospective customers to the extent anticipated. Moreover, our commitment to charitable giving may not resonate with our existing customers or may fail to attract new customers.\n\n•The amount contributed to nonprofits may be viewed as insufficient by existing or new customers. Furthermore, there may be insufficient money remaining after paying claims to make charitable contributions.\n\n•See \"Business — Our Vertically-Integrated Platform — Reinsurance.\" False claims or higher than expected claims could cause reinsurers to charge higher rates, refuse to provide reinsurance or provide reinsurance on less favorable terms. The control procedures we have implemented to detect false claims, may not prevent such claims from being filed or prevent a sufficient number of them from being paid out.\n\nThe failure of our business model to function as intended could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe could be forced to modify or eliminate our Giveback, which could undermine our business model and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur Giveback is a cornerstone of our business model that, when coupled with our fixed fee, works to align our interests with those of our customers, which we believe builds trust, minimizes fraud, and keeps our costs down. If a state, federal authority or foreign jurisdiction was to find that the Giveback was a rebate rather than a charitable contribution, or impermissible on other grounds, we may not be able to donate the residual value of our customers' premiums to nonprofits in certain, or any, of the states or foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. If even one regulator were to disallow the Giveback, it could force us to abandon the Giveback in part or entirely, either of which could undermine the behavioral economics foundation on which our business model is based, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our brand, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, we could modify, reduce or eliminate the Giveback at our discretion for a variety of reasons. LIC's board of directors may determine the amount and distribution of the Giveback by taking into consideration various factors such as the current goodwill and reputation of the nonprofit selected by customers, the amount of funds available for distribution by each cohort, the reasonableness of such contribution, and general shareholders' interests, such as the proposed amount and distribution of the Giveback against factors like overall shareholder returns, our financial and operating performance, and our social responsibility and the benefits shareholders and their communities receive from proposed contributions. Before determining the amount of the Giveback, LIC‘s board of directors may also analyze the extent of our reinsurance coverage and management's expectations with respect to such reinsurance coverage for the upcoming fiscal year, particularly as it relates to the amount of capital and surplus required to continue to operate successfully. If after weighing any of these factors, LIC's board of directors were to reduce or eliminate the Giveback, our business model would be impacted, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our brand, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n27\n\n\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance, implementation of our business model, and our future prospects.\n\nWe launched our business to sell renters and homeowners insurance in late 2016 and have a limited operating history. Due to our limited operating history and the rapid growth we have experienced since we began operations, our operating results are hard to predict, and our historical results may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our future results. In addition, we have limited data to validate key aspects of our business model. For example, our customer base is made up primarily of renters and we have very few instances of those renters becoming homeowners, a key element of our business model. It is also difficult for us to track that data and the data that we collect may not provide useful measures for evaluating our business model. Our inability to adequately assess our performance and growth could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\n\nOur revenue grew from $256.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $429.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $526.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our rapid growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure has become and will continue to become more complex to the extent that we add staff, and we will continue to enhance our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our corporate culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to the insurance buying experience for the customer. If we cannot manage our growth effectively to maintain the quality and efficiency of our customers' insurance- buying experience, as well as their experience as ongoing customers, our business could be harmed as a result, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIntense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to attain or increase profitability.\n\nThe renters, homeowners (including buildings and content), pet, life and car insurance market is highly competitive with carriers competing through product coverage, reputation, financial strength, advertising, price, customer service and distribution.\n\nWhile we face limited direct competition from traditional insurance companies for first-time renters, we face significant competition from traditional insurance companies for homeowners, car and life. Competitors include companies such as Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual, State Farm, GEICO, Progressive and Travelers. These companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, higher financial ratings, greater resources, and additional access to capital. Our future growth will depend in large part on our ability to grow our homeowners insurance business in which traditional insurance companies retain certain advantages. In particular, unlike us, many of these competitors offer consumers the ability to purchase renters, homeowners and multiple other types of insurance coverage and \"bundle\" them together into one policy and, in certain circumstances, include an umbrella liability policy for additional coverage at competitive prices. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, we could face intense competition from insurance companies that are already established in such markets. Competitors in the pet insurance space include companies such as Nationwide, Embrace, and Trupanion. Competitors in the car insurance space include companies such as Progressive, GEICO and Allstate. Additionally, any new insurance products could take months to be approved by regulatory authorities, or may not be approved at all.\n\nWe currently face competition by technology companies in the markets in which we operate. There are various technology companies that have recently started operating in adjacent insurance categories that may in the future offer renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance products. Technology companies may in the future begin operating and offering products at better and more competitive pricing than us, which could cause our results of operations and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, traditional insurance companies may seek to adapt their businesses to sell insurance and process claims using technology similar to ours. Given their size, resources, and other competitive advantages, they may be able to erode any market advantage we may currently have over them.\n\n28\n\n\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business and impact our capital needs. Furthermore, reinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nReinsurance is a contract by which an insurer, which may be referred to as the ceding insurer, agrees with a second insurer, called a reinsurer, that the reinsurer will cover a portion of the losses incurred by the ceding insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the ceding insurer, in exchange for a premium. Our insurance subsidiaries, LIC and MIC, obtain reinsurance to help manage their exposure to property and casualty insurance risks. Although our reinsurance counterparties are liable to us according to the terms of the reinsurance policies, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of our insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of our reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations, that the reinsurers will not pay in a timely fashion, or that our losses are so large that they exceed the limits inherent in our reinsurance contracts, limiting recovery. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years, in which case we may have no legal ability to recover what is due to us under our agreement with such reinsurer. Any disputes with reinsurers regarding coverage under reinsurance contracts could be time consuming, costly, and uncertain of success.\n\nUnder the Proportional Reinsurance Contracts, which span all of our products and geographies, we transfer, or “cede,” a specified percentage of our premiums to our reinsurers. In exchange, these reinsurers pay us a “ceding commission” on all premiums ceded to the Reinsurers, in addition to funding the corresponding claims, subject to certain limitations. We have also opted to manage the remaining portion of our business with alternative forms of reinsurance through the Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts. Our business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes which are inherently unpredictable. On July 1, 2024, we entered into a one year property catastrophe excess of loss treaty. If we are unable to renegotiate, at the same or more favorable terms, the Proportional Reinsurance Contracts or the Non-Proportional Reinsurance Contracts when each expires, such changes could have an adverse impact on our business model.\n\nWe may change the structure of our reinsurance arrangement in the future, which may impact our overall risk profile and financial and capital condition. We may be unable to negotiate a new reinsurance contract to provide continuous coverage or negotiate reinsurance on the same terms and rates as are currently available, as such availability depends in part on factors outside of our control. A new contract may not provide sufficient reinsurance protection. Market forces and external factors, such as significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks or an increase in capital requirements, impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. If we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance, extend our reinsurance contracts or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient at acceptable prices, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure, reduce our insurance writings or develop or seek other alternatives.\n\nThe unavailability of acceptable reinsurance cover would have an adverse impact on our business model, which depends on reinsurance companies to absorb any unfavorable variance from the level of losses anticipated at underwriting. If we are unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, we would have to increase our risk exposure or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, each of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business volume and profitability. Alternatively, we could elect to pay higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon our profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in most cases subject to approval by state regulators, to offset this additional cost. Moreover, if adequate reinsurance cannot be obtained or maintained at reasonable rates, we may be unable to make contributions to the nonprofit organizations selected by our customers as part of our Giveback, which could erode customer trust, damage our brand, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n29\n\n\nFailure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business.\n\nWe must have sufficient capital to comply with insurance regulatory requirements and maintain authority to conduct our business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") has developed a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital of U.S.-based insurers, known as risk-based capital that all states have adopted. This system establishes the minimum amount of capital necessary for an insurance company to support its overall business operations. It identifies insurers, including property-casualty insurers, that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurer's assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Moreover, as a new entrant to the insurance industry, we may face additional capital requirements as compared to those of our larger and more established competitors. Failure to maintain adequate risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct its business. See \"Regulation — Risk-Based Capital.\"\n\nIf we are unable to maintain and implement relationships with third-party service providers, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties are adversely impacted by financial, reputational, regulatory and other risks, our prospects for future growth and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nSome parts of our business depend on our relationships and contractual arrangements with third parties. If our third parties terminate business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, we may fail to meet our business objectives and targets, and our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, our life insurance product is offered through an arrangement with a life insurance provider. In these relationships, we rely on the third-party’s internal controls, to manage the product. Our monitoring efforts of the third party provider’s and other service providers may not be adequate, or our providers could exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, which could result in operational disruption, reputational damage and regulatory intervention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Furthermore, these third parties are subject to many of the same risks that we face, including those related to cybersecurity and fraudulent claims.  These parties also experience intense competition in the segments of the insurance industry in which they operate. They may be acquired or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing or eliminating their business with us.  If we are unsuccessful in our ability to maintain successful relationships with these third-party service providers and implement our arrangements with them for any of these reasons, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we are unable to expand our product offerings, or expand into new markets, our prospects for future growth may be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and therefore increase our revenue depends on our ability to successfully expand our product offerings into new markets. In 2020, we launched pet insurance and in 2021 we launched our life and car insurance products to add to our renters and homeowners insurance offerings, and in 2024, we expanded our offerings in the UK and France to include Buildings insurance. Our success in the renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance markets depend on our deep understanding of each market and associated business challenges faced by participants in them. Developing this level of understanding of the newer markets we have entered may require substantial investments of time and resources, and we may not be successful. In addition to the need for substantial resources, insurance regulation could limit our ability to introduce new product offerings or the states in which we offer them. Additionally, any new insurance products could take months to be approved by regulatory authorities, or may not be approved at all. If our products are not competitive in current markets or we do not penetrate new markets successfully, our revenue may grow at a slower rate than we anticipate and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our decision to expand our insurance product offerings beyond the renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance market would subject us to additional regulatory requirements specific to such insurance products, which, in turn, could require us to incur additional costs or devote additional resources to compliance.\n\n30\n\n\nOur proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to, which could cause us to write policies we should not write, price those policies inappropriately or overpay claims that are made by our customers.\n\nWe utilize the data gathered from the insurance application process to determine whether or not to write a particular policy and, if so, how to price that particular policy. Similarly, we use proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms to process many of our claims. The data that we gather through our interactions with our customers is evaluated and curated by proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms. The continuous development, maintenance and operation of our deep-learning backend data analytics engine is expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties including material performance problems, undetected defects or errors, for example, with new capabilities incorporating artificial intelligence. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary algorithms from operating properly. If our data analytics do not function reliably, we may incorrectly price insurance products for our customers or incorrectly pay or deny claims made by our customers. Either of these situations could result in customer dissatisfaction with us, which could cause customers to cancel their insurance policies with us, prevent prospective customers from obtaining new insurance policies, or cause us to underprice policies or overpay claims. Such situations may also result in fines and monetary penalties as well as regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action.\n\nRegulators may limit our ability to develop or implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms, and to maintain the confidentiality of this technology. Changes to existing regulations, their interpretation or implementation, or new regulations could impede our use of this technology, or require that we disclose our proprietary technology to our competitors, which could impair our competitive position and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nExisting and new legislation or legal requirements may affect how we communicate with our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nState and federal lawmakers, and insurance regulators are focusing upon the use of AI broadly, including concerns about transparency, deception, and fairness in particular. Changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, specific to the use of AI, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. In addition, our business and operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local consumer protection laws, including laws which place restrictions on the use of automated and non-automated tools and technologies to communicate with wireless telephone subscribers or consumers generally.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender.  In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) places restrictions on making outbound calls, faxes, and SMS text messages to consumers using certain types of automated or prerecorded technology or that involve marketing.  Among other restrictions under the TCPA, with respect to phone calls and text messages, prior express consent, and in the case of certain marketing messages, prior express written consent, of consumers may be required before sending certain outbound calls or text messages. We could face allegations that we have violated the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act, or similar laws, rules and regulations, and even if these allegations are without merit, we could face regulatory inquiries, lawsuits and related defense costs, liability (such as fines, damages, consent decrees, and injunctions), harm to our reputation and other losses that could harm our business.\n\n31\n\n\nA California law, effective as of July 2019, makes it unlawful for any person to use a bot to communicate with a person in California online with the intent to mislead the other person about its artificial identity for the purpose of knowingly deceiving the person about the content of the communication in order to incentivize a purchase of goods or services in a commercial transaction. Although we have taken steps to mitigate our liability for violations of this and other laws restricting the use of electronic communication tools, no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to civil litigation or regulatory enforcement. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the ways in which we communicate with prospective or current customers before or during onboarding, customer care, or claims management, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in our customer acquisition and retention, reducing the growth prospects of our business, and adversely affecting our financial condition and future cash flows.\n\nWe rely on artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes, and any legal or regulatory requirements that prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data could thus materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe use artificial intelligence, telematics, mobile technology, and our digital platforms to collect data that we evaluate in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies, managing claims and customer support, and improving business processes. If federal, state or international regulators or courts were to determine that the type of data we collect, the process we use for collecting this data or how we use it unfairly discriminates against or otherwise violates the rights of some groups of people, laws and regulations could be interpreted or implemented to prohibit or restrict our ability to collect or use this data.\n\nState legislatures and insurance regulators have also shown interest in the use of external data and artificial intelligence in insurance practices, including underwriting, marketing and claims practices. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted its Artificial Intelligence Principles in August 2020, a model bulletin titled “Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers,” and a number of states have had legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to the use of external data and artificial intelligence in the insurance industry, including bulletins issued in 2022 by the California and Connecticut Departments of Insurance, and more recently in July 2024 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, advising insurers of their obligations related to unfair discrimination when using big data and artificial intelligence.\n\nDue to Proposition 103 in California, our largest market for car insurance, we are currently limited in our ability to use telematics data beyond miles-driven to underwrite insurance, including data on how the car is driven. This could hinder our ability to accurately assess the risks that we underwrite in other states if they were to pass similar laws or regulations. In three other states where we currently operate, we do not use behavioral telematics data because it is either (a) permitted, but we opted out given uncertainty regarding the impact such data would have on pricing, or (b) it is voluntary (meaning the policyholder has to opt in). As we aim to be a fully national provider of insurance across 50 states and Washington, D.C. in the future, we will need to comply with the rules and regulations of each market. At this time, we do not know which of our target markets prohibit, permit with conditions, or fully permit the use of behavioral telematics to set premiums, and if permitted, if this will be of benefit to us in pricing. While we are currently in discussions with regulators to allow the use of telematics to a greater extent to underwrite and price insurance policies, we cannot predict the outcome of these discussions, and there can be no assurance that state regulators will revise regulations accordingly, if at all, nor that current permissive states will further restrict the use of such data. Although there is currently limited federal and state legislation outside of California restricting our ability to collect driving behavior data, private organizations are implementing principles and guidelines to protect driver privacy. Some state regulators have expressed interest in the use of external data sources, algorithms and/or predictive models in insurance underwriting or rating. Specifically, regulators have raised questions about the potential for unfair discrimination, disparate impact, and lack of transparency associated with the use of external consumer data. Regulators may also require us to disclose the external data we use, algorithms and/or predictive matters prior to approving our underwriting models and rates. Such disclosures could put our intellectual property at risk.\n\n32\n\n\nAdditionally, existing laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”, collectively “CCPA”), future laws, and evolving attitudes about privacy protection may impair our ability to collect, use, and maintain data points of sufficient type or quantity to develop and train our artificial intelligence algorithms. If such laws or regulations were enacted federally or in a large number of states in which we operate, it could impact the integrity and quality of our pricing and underwriting processes.\n\nThere is also increasing focus on regulating the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Europe. In 2023, the European Union legislators reached a political agreement on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for artificial intelligence in the EU market. The EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply by 2026. The EU AI Act will apply to companies like ours that develop, use and/ or provide artificial intelligence in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose artificial intelligence and foundation models, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover for the most serious compliance failures. In addition, the revised EU Product Liability Directive came into force in December 2024, to be implemented into EU Member State national law by December 2026. This Directive extends the EU’s existing strict product liability regime to artificial intelligence technologies and artificial intelligence -enabled products and facilitates civil claims in respect of harm caused by artificial intelligence and there are further legislative proposals to regulate AI. With these developments, legislation relating to artificial intelligence including the EU AI Act has a material impact on the way artificial intelligence is regulated in the EU, and together with developing guidance and/ or decisions in this area, is likely to affect our use of artificial intelligence and our ability to provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\nWe depend on search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content-based online advertising and other online sources to attract consumers to our website and our online app, which may be affected by third-party interference beyond our control.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract consumers to our website and our online app and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. We depend, in large part, on search engines, social media platforms, digital app stores, content-based online advertising and other online sources for traffic to our website and our online app.\n\nWith respect to search engines, we are included in search results as a result of both paid search listings, where we purchase specific search terms that result in the inclusion of our advertisement, and free search listings, which depend on algorithms used by search engines. For paid search listings, if one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose consumers and traffic to our website could decrease, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For free search listings, if search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, our websites may appear less prominently or not at all in search results, which could result in reduced traffic to our websites.\n\nOur ability to maintain and increase the number of consumers directed to our products from digital platforms is not within our control. Search engines, social media platforms and other online sources often revise their algorithms and introduce new advertising products. If one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for traffic to our website and our online app were to modify its general methodology for how it displays our advertisements or keyword search results, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our website and our online app, our business and operating results are likely to suffer. In addition, if our online display advertisements are no longer effective or are not able to reach certain consumers due to consumers' use of ad-blocking software, our business and operating results could suffer.\n\n33\n\n\nAdditionally, changes in regulations or commercial practices have limited and will continue to limit the ability of search engines and social media platforms, including, but not limited to, Google and Facebook, to collect data from users and engage in targeted advertising. For example, the proposed Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act would mandate annual disclosure to the SEC of the type and \"aggregate value\" of user data used by harvesting companies, such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Google and Amazon, including how revenue is generated by user data and what measures are taken to protect the data. If the costs of advertising on search engines and social media platforms increase, we may incur additional marketing expenses or be required to allocate a larger portion of our marketing spend to other channels and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Similarly, insurance brokerage and distribution regulation may limit our ability to rely on key distribution platforms, such as the Lemonade API, if the third party distribution platforms are unable to continue to distribute our insurance products pursuant to insurance law and regulations.\n\nThe marketing of our insurance products depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with digital app stores, in particular, those operated by Google and Apple. Furthermore, because many of our customers access our insurance products through an online app, we depend on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our online app. Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our online app, including those relating to the amount of (and requirement to pay) certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by Apple and Google through our online app, to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute online app through their stores, the features we provide and the manner in which we market in-app products. We cannot be certain that Apple or Google will not limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our online app, the features we provide and the manner in which we market our online app. To the extent either or both of them do so, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, one of the factors we use to evaluate our customer satisfaction and market position is our Apple App Store ratings. This rating, however, may not be a reliable indicator of our customer satisfaction relative to other companies who are rated on the Apple App Store since, to date, we have received a fraction of the number of reviews of some of the companies we benchmark against.\n\nWe also attract customers through our relationships with certain business development partners. If our business development partners were to charge higher rates or decide to terminate their relationships with us, our ability to attract customers could be materially impaired. In addition, we have expanded our direct to customer acquisition channels, including subway and taxicab panels. Our efforts to acquire customers through direct marketing may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny by state insurance regulators pursuant to unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices laws.\n\nWe may require additional capital to grow our business, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\nTo the extent that our capital is insufficient at any point in time to meet future operating requirements (including regulatory capital requirements) or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected growth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, the availability of reinsurance, as well as market disruptions and other developments.\n\nHistorically, we have funded our operations, marketing expenditures and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. In addition, the NYDFS, Delaware Department of Insurance (\"DE Dept.\"), California Department of Insurance (\"CDI\"), and other regulatory bodies may not permit additional equity issuances or other forms of financing that we may wish to pursue. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\n\n34\n\n\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and warrants, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Our stockholders may also face dilution as the warrants issued to Chewy Insurance Services, LLC which will vest in installments, in increasing amounts over a period of five years, subject to certain vesting events and thresholds. See Note 16 for more information about the terms of these warrants. Furthermore, any debt financing secured by us in the future could require that a substantial portion of our operating cash flow be devoted to the payment of interest and principal on such indebtedness, which may decrease available funds for other business activities, and could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\n\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, maintain minimum amounts of risk-based capital and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by our sole provider of third-party data centers or our internet service providers could impair the operability of our website and our online app and may cause our business to suffer.\n\nWe currently offer our products through our website and online app using Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") data centers, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, floods, fires, severe storms, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures, and similar events, many of which are beyond our control, any of which could disrupt our services, prevent customers from accessing our products, destroy customer data, or prevent us from being able to continuously back up and record data. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our data centers or related systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to customers or damage to our reputation. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS, and, even if we do switch our operations, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our website and online app. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance, it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our services or products.\n\nAWS enables us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions and provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. Termination of the AWS agreement may harm our ability to access data centers we need to host our website and online app or to do so on terms as favorable as those we have with AWS.\n\nAs we continue to expand the number of customers to whom we provide our products and services, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of AWS data centers or third-party internet service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our website or online app or impede our ability to scale our operations. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our website or online app as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n35\n\n\nSecurity incidents or real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our systems, website or app could impair our operations, result in loss of personal customer information, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur continued success is dependent on our systems, applications, and software continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. We rely on our technology and engineering staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our systems and services in an efficient and secure manner. Like all information systems and technology, our website and online app may contain material errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs, particularly when new features or capabilities are released, and may be subject to computer viruses or malicious code, break-ins, phishing impersonation attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, as well as unintentional incidents causing data leakage, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or website or online app shutdowns, or could cause loss of critical data, or the unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of personal or other confidential information.\n\nIf we experience compromises to our security that result in technology performance, integrity, or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our website or our online app or the loss or unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of confidential information, customers may lose trust and confidence in us, and customers may decrease the use of our website or our online app, or stop using our website or our online app entirely. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or customers' information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often they are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Even if we take steps that we believe are adequate to protect us from cyber threats, hacking against our competitors or other companies could create the perception among our customers or potential customers that our digital platform is not safe to use.\n\nA significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems, software, or services may harm our reputation, impair our ability to operate, retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\nWe are periodically subject to examinations by our primary state insurance regulators, which could result in adverse examination findings and necessitate remedial actions.\n\nWe provide insurance through our subsidiaries, LIC and MIC. Since LIC is a New York State-domiciled insurance company, LIC’s  primary insurance regulator responsible for supervision and examination is the NYDFS. Since MIC is domiciled in Delaware and is commercially domiciled in California, MIC’s primary insurance regulators responsible for supervision and examination are the Delaware Department of Insurance and the California Department of Insurance. LIC and MIC are subject to a financial examination by their primary insurance regulators generally every three to five years, under which they will evaluate the financial condition and identify current and prospective risks of each company by obtaining information about each company including corporate governance, identifying and assessing inherent risks within each company and evaluating system controls and procedures used to mitigate those risks. In 2024, the NYDFS completed a group financial exam of LIC and MIC covering the years 2019 through 2022 for LIC, and 2021 and 2022 for MIC. All required remediation pursuant to the group financial exam was completed in 2024, however, we cannot predict with precision the likelihood, nature, or extent of any necessary remedial actions in any future examinations.\n\nIn addition, insurance regulators of other states in which we are licensed to operate periodically conduct market conduct examinations or other targeted investigations. We are presently subject to, and in the future will continue to be subject to, such examination and investigations. Any regulatory or enforcement action or any regulatory order imposing remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action against us resulting from these examinations or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The results of each examination can give rise to fines and monetary penalties as well as regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action.\n\n36\n\n\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use customer information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data, respect customers' privacy or comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\n\nUse of technology to offer insurance products involves the storage and transmission of information, including personal information, in relation to our staff, contractors, business partners and current, past or potential customers. Security breaches have occurred and may occur again, including by hackers or insiders, could expose confidential information, which could result in potential regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, compliance orders, liability, litigation and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, unauthorized parties could steal or access our users' names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and other information that we collect when providing insurance quotes, and credit card or other payment information if a customer agrees to purchase insurance coverage from us. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or customers' information. Any of these incidents, or any other types of security or privacy related incidents, could result in an investigation by a competent regulator, resulting in a fine or penalty, or an order to implement specific compliance measures. It could also trigger claims by affected third parties. While we use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties designed to effect secure transmission of such information, we cannot guarantee the security of the transfer and storage of personal information.\n\nAny or all of the issues above could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers, or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security, and data breaches.  Such legislation includes the CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, including an obligation to provide certain new disclosures to such residents. Specifically, among other things, the CCPA creates new consumer rights, and imposes corresponding obligations on covered businesses, relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information collected by covered businesses, including California residents' right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain sharing and sales of their personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The law exempts from certain requirements of the CCPA certain information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act, the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act. The definition of \"personal information\" in the CCPA is broad and may encompass other information that we maintain beyond that excluded under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act or the California Financial Information Privacy Act exemption. Further, the CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action increases the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. \n\nAdditionally, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was recently passed in California and expands the scope of the CCPA and creates new consumer privacy rights for California residents, including rights to correct personal information. Further, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on businesses to implement data retention and minimization practices contractually limit the use of personal information by service providers and contractors, perform cybersecurity audits and risk assessments, and implement reasonable security. The CPRA also permits consumers to opt out of the sharing of personal information for use in behavioral advertising, which may impact our ability to market our products and services. The CPRA also establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is the first data privacy regulator in the U.S., to enforce the CPRA. The CPRA strengthens some of the enforcement authority established under the CCPA and could result in increased enforcement actions and fines. We may incur additional costs associated with compliance efforts leading up to the effective date.\n\nSome observers have noted that the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, and multiple states have enacted, or are expected to enact, similar laws. There is also discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data protection and privacy law to which we likely would be subject if it is enacted. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.\n\n37\n\n\nAs we continue to expand into Europe and the UK, we may also face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the GDPR and other data protection regulations. The GDPR imposes comprehensive data privacy compliance obligations in relation to our collection, processing, sharing, disclosure, transfer and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data” , including a principal of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way we process data (including by way of our algorithms). In the event of a data breach, we are also subject to breach notification laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including U.S. state laws and the GDPR, and the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, a number of federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy affect and apply to the insurance industry specifically, including those imposed by the NYDFS. See \"Business - Regulation.\"\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, compliance orders, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause customers to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, new and changed rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection (in particular those that impact the use of artificial intelligence) and cross-border transfers of customer information could cause us to delay planned uses and disclosures of data to comply with applicable privacy and data protection requirements. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put personal information at risk, which may result in increased regulatory scrutiny and have a material adverse effect to our reputation, business and operating results.\n\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in our business, and the inability to maintain these licenses, errors in the software we license or the terms of open source licenses could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business relies on certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the risks associated with the use of third-party software cannot be eliminated, and these risks could negatively affect our business.\n\nAdditionally, the software powering our technology systems incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our systems. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code or re-engineer all or a portion of our technology systems, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technology systems. Such risk could be difficult or impossible to eliminate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe may be subject to compliance obligations arising from medical information privacy regulations.\n\nBy processing certain personal injury data on behalf of our clients, we may be subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws specific to the protection of healthcare information. Although we may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and related state laws, we do not have a process in place to assess or align our privacy and security practices specifically against requirements for protecting medical information.\n\n38\n\n\nWe may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks as we continue to expand into Europe and the UK in connection with the GDPR, UK GDPR, and other data protection regulations.\n\nThe GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by our business in the context of our establishments in the European Union and/or the UK. In addition, all portions of our business established outside the European Union may be required to comply with the requirements of the GDPR with respect to the offering of products or services to individuals in the European Union or UK. The GDPR could also apply to our establishments of business outside the European Union if we were to monitor the activities of individuals in the European Union or become established in the European Union/UK. The GDPR increases the maximum level of fines for the most serious compliance failures to the greater of four percent of annual worldwide turnover or €20,000,000/ GBP17,500,000, respectively.\n\nWe may also be subject to the local privacy and data protection laws of the E.U. Member States in which we offer products or services, which can carry penalties and potential criminal sanctions.\n\nThe regulatory requirements and restrictions set out in the GDPR include, among others, the following:\n\n•The GDPR imposes a number of principles with respect to the processing of personal data, including requirements to process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to process personal data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of personal data, limit the retention of personal data for no longer than is necessary, and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We are implementing external and internal policies and procedures, technical measures and internal training designed to adhere to those principles;\n\n•In relation to the transparency principle, the GDPR requires us to provide individuals in the European Union and the U.K. whose personal data we process (\"data subjects\") with certain information regarding the processing of their personal data by us, and we have an E.U. and U.K. privacy policy, which can be found at https://www.lemonade.com/de/en/privacy-policy (with respect to Germany), https://www.lemonade.com/nl/en/privacy-policy (with respect to the Netherlands) and http://www.lemonade.com/fr/en/privacy-policy (with respect to France);  and https://www.lemonade.com/uk/privacy-policy (with respect to UK).\n\n•The GDPR requires us to maintain internal records of our processing activities and to make those records available to regulators on demand;\n\n•The GDPR requires us to include certain mandatory terms in our agreements with third parties that process personal data subject to the GDPR on our behalf (\"Processors\") and we are in the process of entering into compliant data processing terms with each of our Processors. If third parties with whom we work were to violate their obligations under the GDPR, and/or under their agreements with us, such violation could potentially have an adverse impact on our business;\n\n•The GDPR grants data subjects certain rights, including the right to object to the processing of their personal data by us, to request copies of their personal data from us, to receive information regarding the processing of their personal data and to exercise certain other rights against us in respect of their personal data, and we are implementing internal policies and procedures designed to address those rights;\n\n•The GDPR prohibits automated decision making, i.e. a decision evaluating a data subject's personal aspects based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects or other significant effects for that data subject, except where such decision making is necessary for entering into or performing a contract or is based on the data subject's explicit consent. There is not yet any clear precedent as to whether use of artificial intelligence to make insurance offers to individuals will be considered necessary even though it is integral to our business model. If our automated decision making processes cannot meet this necessity threshold, we cannot use these processes with E.U./U.K. data subjects unless we obtain their explicit consent. Relying on consent to conduct this type of processing holds its own risks because consent must be considered freely given (commentators argue that seeking consent by tying it to a service may be problematic) and consent can be withdrawn by a data subject at any time. We are continually monitoring for updates to guidance in this area, however, if subsequent guidance and/or decisions limit our ability to use our artificial intelligence models, that may decrease our operational efficiency and result in an increase to the costs of operating our business. Automated decision making also attracts a higher regulatory burden under the GDPR, which requires the existence of such automated decision making be disclosed to the data subject including a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Further obligations in terms of \n\n39\n\n\ntransparency are likely to be imposed under new laws regulating AI, including the EU AI Act which became effective in 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply in 2026. The EU AI Act includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security and accuracy, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Once fully applicable, the EU AI Act will have a material impact on the way artificial intelligence is regulated in the EU, and together with developing guidance and/ or decisions in this area, is likely to affect our use of artificial intelligence and our ability to provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.; and\n\n•The GDPR also places limits on the profiling of individuals, i.e. processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects, like analyzing or predicting aspects of a person's economic situation, health, personal preferences, location, etc. There is increasing enforcement related to the lawfulness, fairness and transparency of this processing, and there is still uncertainty about the relevant lawful basis for this activity (i.e., consent or legitimate interests) and, in the case of legitimate interests, it is unclear what kind of opt-out or objection mechanism would be required to achieve GDPR compliance. We are continually monitoring for updates to guidance in this area, however, if subsequent guidance and/or decisions limit our ability to engage in profiling, that may decrease our operational efficiency and result in an increase to the costs of operating our business.\n\nWe are also subject to European Union rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses - a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism - alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. \n\nWe currently rely on the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK Addendum to the EU standard contractual clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement as relevant to transfer personal data outside the EEA and the UK with respect to both intragroup and third party transfers. We expect international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to be challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines; we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes; we may have to implement revised standard contractual clauses for existing intragroup, customer and vendor arrangements within required time frames; and/or it could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\nIn respect of the GDPR’s obligations, we rely on positions and interpretations of the law that have yet to be fully tested before the relevant courts and regulators. If a regulator or court of competent jurisdiction determined that one or more of our compliance efforts does not satisfy the applicable requirements of the GDPR, or if any party brought a claim in this regard, there could be potential governmental or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, compliance orders, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and that could cause customers to lose trust in us and damage our reputation. Likewise, a change in guidance could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n40\n\n\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. In the EU and the UK under national laws derived from the ePrivacy Directive, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent for cookies, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. Recent European court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. If the trend of increasing enforcement by regulators of the strict approach to opt-in consent for all but essential use cases, as seen in recent guidance and decisions continues this  may increase the cost of operating our business and lead to a decline in revenues and impair our ability to collect user information. In addition, legal uncertainties about the legality of cookies and other tracking technologies may lead to regulatory scrutiny and increase potential civil liability under data protection or consumer protection laws. Any such changes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices which could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively and may adversely affect our ability to acquire customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In light of the complex and evolving nature of EU, EU Member State and UK privacy laws on cookies and tracking technologies be successful in our efforts to comply with such laws; violations of such laws could result in regulatory investigations, fines, orders to cease/ change our use of such technologies, as well as civil claims including class actions, and reputational damage.\n\nAny significant change to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices, regarding the use of personal data, or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices, and business practices, including potentially material changes. Such changes could potentially have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe may be unable to prevent or address the misappropriation of our data.\n\nFrom time to time, third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, bots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites or online apps may misappropriate data and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website or our online app. If we become aware of such websites or online apps, we intend to employ technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites or online apps in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites or online apps operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the effect of the operation of such websites or online apps. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites or online apps, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our Co-Founders, senior management team, highly-specialized insurance experts, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel.\n\nOur success depends upon the continued service of Daniel Schreiber, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, and Shai Wininger, our co-founder, President and a member of our board of directors (collectively with Mr. Schreiber, our \"Co-Founders\"), and senior management team, highly-specialized insurance experts and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. If we are unable to attract the requisite personnel, our business and prospects may be adversely affected. Each of our Co-Founders, executive officers, specialized insurance experts, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of either of our Co-Founders or any other member of our senior management team, specialized insurance experts or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic business objectives and could harm our business. We rely on a small number of highly-specialized insurance experts, the loss of any one of whom could have a disproportionate impact on our business. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. Our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Moreover, if and when the stock options or other equity awards are substantially vested, employees under such equity arrangements may be more likely to leave, particularly when the underlying shares have seen a value appreciation.\n\n41\n\n\nWe face significant competition for personnel, particularly in New York, where our headquarters is located and in Tel Aviv, where many of our technical employees are located. To attract top talent, we offer, and will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. We may also need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competitor actions. If we are unable to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs, or otherwise fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf our customers were to claim that the policies they purchased failed to provide adequate or appropriate coverage, we could face claims that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCustomers could purchase policies that prove to be inadequate or inappropriate, and if such customers were to bring a claim or claims alleging that we failed in our responsibilities to provide them with the type or amount of coverage that they sought to purchase, Lemonade Insurance Agency, LLC or Metromile Insurance Services LLC could be found liable, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain agents errors and omissions insurance coverage to protect us against such liability, such coverage may be insufficient or inadequate.\n\nWe conduct certain of our operations in Israel and therefore our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel and the surrounding region.\n\nWe maintain offices in Israel and some of our officers, employees and directors are located in Israel, including our Co-Founders and some of our product development staff, help desk and online sales support operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 297 full-time employees in Israel. Although we do not currently sell our insurance products in Israel, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our Israeli operations. In recent years, including most recently in October 2023, Israel has been involved in sporadic armed conflicts with Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip, with Hezbollah, an Islamist terrorist group that controls large portions of Southern Lebanon, and with Iranian-backed military forces in Syria. Some of these hostilities, including the most recent attacks by Hamas in October 2023, were accompanied by missile strikes from the Gaza Strip against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our officers, employees and directors are located, and negatively affected conditions in Israel. The tension between Israel and Iran and/or these groups continues to escalate and may turn even more violent in the future, which could materially adversely affect conditions in Israel in general and our operations in particular.\n\nFurthermore, many Israeli citizens are obligated to perform several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to the recent terrorist activity, there have been call-ups of military reservists and it is possible that there will be increases in military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Some of our officers and employees based in Israel have been called upon to perform military reserve duty and/or active duty, and others may be called in the future. Our operations have been and may continue to be partially disrupted by these employee absences, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have contingency plans and structures in place to mitigate these risks, and we continue to monitor our ongoing activities and will make any needed adjustments to ensure the continuity of our business, while supporting the safety and well-being of our employees.\n\nParties with whom we do business may sometimes decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary to meet our business partners in person. Further, shifting economic and political conditions in the United States and in other countries may result in changes in how the United States and other countries conduct business and other relations with Israel, which may have an adverse impact on our Israeli operations and a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies whether as a result of hostilities in the region or otherwise. Moreover, there have been increased efforts by organizations and movements to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods based on Israeli government policies. Any hostilities, armed conflicts or political instability involving Israel could adversely affect our results of operations. With regards to the recent hostilities, there is still uncertainty regarding the extent to which it will impact our operations in Israel, which we continue to evaluate.\n\n42\n\n\nOur commercial insurance may not cover losses that could occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An escalation of tensions or violence might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business.\n\nIn addition, the Israeli government has recently and may in the future pursue extensive changes to Israel’s judicial system. In response to such changes, many individuals, organizations and institutions, both within and outside of Israel, have in the past and may in the future voice concerns that the proposed changes may negatively impact the business environment in Israel, due to potential reluctance of foreign investors to invest or transact business in Israel, increased currency fluctuations, downgrades in credit rating, increased interest rates, increased volatility in securities markets, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions. To the extent that any of these negative developments occur, they may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations, or our ability to raise additional funds, if deemed necessary by our management and board of directors.\n\nWe may become subject to claims under Israeli law for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our Israel-based employees or consultants, which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business.\n\nWe enter into assignment of invention agreements with employees and consultants, pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967 (the \"Israel Patent Law\"), inventions conceived by an employee or a person deemed to be an employee (for example a consultant that was deemed to be an employee by the Israeli labor courts) during and in consequence of their employment are regarded as \"service inventions,\" which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between employee and employer. Nevertheless, in the case of a service invention, employees and former employees may petition the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee established under the Israel Patent Law to determine whether they are entitled to remuneration for their service inventions. Although in the assignment of invention agreements with our employees they agree to waive their right to any additional compensation with respect to the service inventions, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee and the Supreme Court have held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having waived such rights, resulting in uncertainty under Israeli law with respect to the efficacy of waivers of service invention rights. As such, we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned service inventions, and as a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current or former employees (or consultants that might be deemed as employees), or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our company culture has been critical to our success. Our status as a Certified B Corp and commitment to charitable giving distinguish us from our competitors and promote a relationship among our employees and customers founded on trust. We not only seek to engender a trusting relationship between our brand and our customers, but also among our employees. Our ability to continue to cultivate and maintain this culture is essential to our growth and continued success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\n\n•failure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\n\n•the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce, and our ability to promote a uniform and consistent culture across all our offices and employees;\n\n•the market perception about our charitable contributions and social and political stances;\n\n•competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\n\n•the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; and\n\n•the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us.\n\n43\n\n\nOur unique culture is one of our core characteristics that helps us to attract and retain key personnel. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we would have to incur additional costs and find alternative methods to recruit key employees, which in turn could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to be adversely affected.\n\nIf we are unable to underwrite risks accurately and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\n\nIn general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. The accuracy of our pricing is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks, estimate losses and comply with state insurance regulations. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. We also utilize the data that we gather through our interactions with our customers, as evaluated and curated by our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms.\n\nEstablishing adequate premium rates is necessary, together with investment income, if any, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") and other costs. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we underwrite, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our profitability. Moreover, if we determine that our prices are too low, insurance regulations may preclude us from being able to cancel insurance contracts, non-renew customers, or raise prices. Alternatively, we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nPricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. In order to accurately price our policies, we must:\n\n•collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our customers;\n\n•develop, test and apply appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas;\n\n•review and evaluate competitive product offerings and pricing dynamics;\n\n•closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and\n\n•project both frequency and severity of our customers' losses with reasonable accuracy.\n\nThere are no assurances that we will have success in implementing our pricing methodology accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to accurately price our policies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n•insufficient or unreliable data;\n\n•incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\n•uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\n•our failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies;\n\n•incorrect or incomplete analysis of the competitive environment;\n\n•regulatory constraints on rate increases; and\n\n•our failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expense, as well as unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\n\nTo address the potential inadequacy of our current business model, we may be compelled to increase the amount allocated to cover policy claims, increase premium rates or adopt tighter underwriting standards, any of which may result in a decline in new business and renewals and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n44\n\n\nOur exposure to loss activity and regulation may be greater in states where we currently have most of our customers: California, New York and Texas.\n\nApproximately 49% of our gross written premium for the year ended December 31, 2024 originated from customers in California, New York, and Texas. As a result of this concentration, if a significant catastrophe event or series of such events occurs and causes material loss in California, New York and Texas, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. For example, the recent wildfires in the Greater Los Angeles area have underscored the potential for substantial claims in this key market and we continue to assess the impact to our business. Further, as compared to our competitors who operate on a wider geographic scale, any adverse changes in the regulatory environment affecting property and casualty insurance in California, New York and Texas may expose us to more significant risks.\n\nOur product development cycles are complex and subject to regulatory approval, and we may incur significant expenses before we generate revenues, if any, from new products.\n\nBecause our products are highly-advanced and require rigorous testing and regulatory approvals, development cycles can be complex. Moreover, development projects can be technically challenging and expensive, and may be delayed or defeated by the inability to obtain licensing or other regulatory approvals. The nature of these development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we generate revenues, if any, from such expenses. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of products that are competitive in the marketplace, this could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a product we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced. Such decreased customer demand may cause us to fall short of our sales targets, and we may nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the product's development. If we are unable to complete product development cycles successfully and in a timely fashion and generate revenues from such future products, the growth of our business may be harmed.\n\nLitigation and legal proceedings filed by or against us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLitigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, complaints from or litigation by customers or reinsurers, related to alleged breaches of contract or otherwise. As our market share increases, competitors may pursue litigation to require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. As is typical in the insurance industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types arising in the normal course of our business operations, including disputes relating to insurance claims under our policies as well as other general commercial and corporate litigation. Although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, us and other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including sale of insurance and claim settlement practices. In addition, because we employ artificial intelligence to collect data points, customers or consumer groups have brought and could bring individual or class action claims alleging that our methods of collecting or using data and pricing risk are impermissibly discriminatory or otherwise improper. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such material litigation in the future or what impact such material litigation would have on our business. If we were to be involved in litigation and it was determined adversely, it could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even claims without merit can be time- consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, routine lawsuits over claims that are not individually material could in the future become material if aggregated with a substantial number of similar lawsuits. In addition to increasing costs, a significant volume of customer complaints or litigation could adversely affect our brand and reputation, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable. We cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation or other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation, and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition. See \"Legal Proceedings.\"\n\n45\n\n\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur success is dependent in part on protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as source code, information, data, processes and other forms of information, knowhow and technology). We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, there are steps that we have not yet taken to protect our intellectual property on a global basis. Additionally, the steps that we have already taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights.\n\nWhile we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use our proprietary brand, content and information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our competitive position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party providers and strategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our offerings. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\n\nWe have filed, and may continue in the future to file, applications to protect certain of our innovations and intellectual property. We do not know whether any of our applications will result in the issuance of a patent, trademark or copyright, as applicable, or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, we may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our intellectual property. Our existing intellectual property, and any intellectual property granted to us or that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing our rights to our intellectual property. Therefore, the exact effect of the protection of this intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, given the costs, effort, risks and downside of obtaining patent protection, including the requirement to ultimately disclose the invention to the public, we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations. Any failure to adequately obtain such patent protection, or other intellectual property protection, could later prove to adversely impact our business.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Lemonade and Lemonade.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our online app. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or impossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management's attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\n\n46\n\n\nIf we are unable to prevent the unauthorized use or exploitation of our intellectual property, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to customers and potential customers may become confused, and our ability to attract customers may be adversely affected. Any inability or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nCompanies in the internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we gain an increasingly high public profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. We may not be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or from operating under our brand, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to violate such rights, which may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had gross accumulated federal NOLs for tax purposes of $296.2 million, which can be offset against our future taxable income. Of these federal NOLs, $10.5 million in losses will begin to expire in 2035 and $285.7 million in losses can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has gross accumulated state and local losses for tax purposes of $35.3 million which will begin to expire in 2029.\n\nWe may be unable to fully use our NOLs, if at all. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (very generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in the corporation's equity ownership by certain shareholders or groups of shareholders over a rolling three- year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past, and we may or may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we have undergone an ownership change, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOLs existing at the time of the ownership change prior to their expiration. Future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\n47\n\n\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in tax legislation or policies in different geographic jurisdictions may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors, including: changing tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof (such as the Inflation Reduction Act which, among other changes, introduced a 15% corporate minimum tax on certain United States corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by United States corporations); tax policy initiatives and reforms in effect or under consideration (such as those related to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing or other projects); the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties.\n\nWe are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and otherwise affect our future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\n\nOur expansion within the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to expand into additional markets in the United States and abroad. As of December 31, 2024, we were licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in 50 states of the United States and Washington D.C. We operate in 39 of those states and Washington D.C. covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population. We have targeted coverage across all 50 states, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to provide nationwide coverage in the near term or at all. Moreover, one or more states could revoke our license to operate, or implement additional regulatory hurdles that could inhibit our ability to obtain or maintain our license in such states.\n\nIn addition to growing our domestic business, we have started expanding our presence internationally, particularly in Europe. We currently hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe, and commenced operating in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and France in 2020. In October, 2022, the Company began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime. The Company also registered two UK branches: (i) Lemonade Insurance N.V., UK Branch and its affiliate (ii) Lemonade Agency B.V.. In May and June 2023, respectively, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for both of these registered branches allowing us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market. Operating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Moreover, international operations are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in operating in these regions, including political unrest, such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n•obtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\n\n•complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to the insurance business and insurance distribution, capital and outsourcing requirements, data privacy, tax and local regulatory restrictions;\n\n•recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries;\n\n•competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n\n•differing demand dynamics, which may make our product offerings less successful;\n\n•currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n•operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and\n\n•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\n\n48\n\n\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, international expansion may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\n\nExpansion into new markets here and abroad will require additional investments by us in both regulatory approvals and marketing. These incremental costs may include hiring additional personnel, as well as engaging third-party service providers and other research and development costs. If we fail to grow our geographic footprint or geographic growth occurs at a slower rate than expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nSince we conduct limited operations in Israel and Europe, portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in New Israeli Shekels, Euros and GBP pounds. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies may affect our revenues, income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nExternal events such as Brexit, global pandemics, the ongoing uncertainty regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies, including under the new U.S. Presidential administration, the passage of U.S. taxation reform legislation, and concerns over interest rates (particularly short-term rates) each have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially among the U.S. dollar, the GBP pounds and the euro. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the UK, European Union, the United States or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further, the value of the GBP pounds and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken.\n\nThe impact of the Customer Investment Agreement with General Catalyst is unpredictable, and the arrangement may not function as expected, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOn January 8, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Customer Investment Agreement (the “Customer Investment Agreement”), with GC Customer Value Arranger, LLC (a General Catalyst company) (\"GC\"). Under the Customer Investment Agreement, up to $150 million of financing will be provided from June 28, 2023 through December 31, 2024, and up to $140 million will be provided from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025, in each case for the Company’s sales and marketing growth efforts. This Customer Investment Agreement was further amended and restated in April 2024 and June 2024 to clarify certain provisions. On February 3, 2025, the Customer Investment Agreement was further amended under which GC will provide up to an additional $200 million of financing from January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2026. Under the Customer Investment Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions specified therein, at the start of each growth period, an Investment Amount of up to 80% of the Company’s growth spend (the \"Investment Amount\") will be advanced by GC. During each growth period, we will repay each Investment Amount including a 16% rate of return, based upon an agreed schedule. Once fully repaid, we will retain all future reference income related to each respective Investment Amount. The Customer Investment Agreement is intended to deliver cash flow benefits to support our sales and marketing growth efforts. There can be no guarantee that this financing structure will function as intended, and its failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n49\n\n\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\n\nThe insurance business, including the market for renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance, is historically cyclical in nature, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nHistorically, insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, adverse litigation trends, regulatory constraints, general economic conditions, and other factors. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of capital available to the industry that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry. As a result, the insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity increased premium levels. Demand for insurance depends on numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, the introduction of new capital providers and general economic conditions. All of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the insurance industry.\n\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to underwrite insurance at rates we consider appropriate and commensurate relative to the risk assumed. Additionally, negative market conditions could result in a decline in policies sold, an increase in the frequency of claims and premium defaults, and an uptick in the frequency of falsification of claims. If we cannot underwrite insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business will be materially and adversely affected. Any of these factors could lead to an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to extensive insurance industry regulations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were licensed to sell renters, homeowners, pet and/or car insurance policies in 50 states of the United States, and operate in 39 of those states, and Washington, D.C. We also hold a pan-European license, which enables us to sell in 30 countries across Europe, and commenced operating in Germany in 2019, and in the Netherlands and in France in 2020. We also began selling contents insurance in the UK on a cross border basis under the UK’s Temporary Permission Regime in October 2022. In 2023, we received a third country branch authorization in the UK for us to operate on a permanent basis in the UK market.\n\nIn the United States, each state regulator retains the authority to license insurers in their states, and an insurer generally may not operate in a state in which it is not licensed. Accordingly, we are not permitted to sell insurance to residents of the remaining states and territories of the United States, which is likely to put us at a disadvantage among many of our competitors that have been in business much longer than us and are licensed to sell their insurance products in most, if not all, U.S. jurisdictions. We have a reinsurance captive subsidiary, Lemonade Re SPC, domiciled in the Cayman Islands which is subject to inspections by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the states in which we transact business by the individual state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of customers, and not necessarily the interests of insurers or agents, their shareholders or other investors. Numerous aspects of our insurance business are subject to regulation, including, but not limited to, premium rates, mandatory covered risks, limitations on the ability to renew or elect not to renew business, prohibited exclusions, licensing and appointment of agents, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of customers, investments and capital, policy forms and coverages, advertising and other conduct, including restrictions on the use of credit information and other factors in underwriting, as well as other underwriting and claims practices. To the extent we decide to expand our current product offerings to include other insurance products, this would subject us to additional regulatory requirements and scrutiny in each state in which we elect to offer such products. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance. Prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresentations, false advertising, coercion, disparaging other insurers, unfair claims settlement procedures, and discrimination in the business of insurance. Noncompliance with any of such state statute may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents.\n\n50\n\n\nSuch laws, rules and regulations are usually overseen and enforced by the various state insurance departments, as well as through private rights of action and by state attorneys general. Such regulations or enforcement actions are often responsive to current consumer and political sensitivities, such as homeowners insurance rates and coverage forms, or which may arise after a major event. Such rules and regulations may result in rate suppression, limit our ability to manage our exposure to unprofitable or volatile risks, or lead to fines, premium refunds or other adverse consequences. The federal government also may regulate aspects of our businesses, such as the protection of consumer confidential information or the use of consumer insurance (credit) scores to underwrite and assess the risk of customers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"). Among other things, the FCRA requires insurance companies to have a permissible purpose before obtaining and using a consumer report for underwriting purposes, as well as comply with related notice and recordkeeping requirements. Failure to comply with federal requirements under the FCRA or any other applicable federal laws would subject us to regulatory fines and other sanctions. In addition, given our short operating history to-date and rapid speed of growth, we are particularly vulnerable to regulators identifying errors in the policy forms we use, the rates we charge, and our customer communications. As a result of such noncompliance, regulators could impose fines, rebates or other penalties, including cease-and-desist orders for an individual state, or all states, until the identified noncompliance is rectified.\n\nOur ability to retain state licenses depends on our ability to meet licensing requirements established by the NAIC and adopted by each state, subject to variations across states. If we are unable to satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of any particular state, we could lose our license to do business in such state, which would result in the temporary or permanent cessation of our operations in that state. Alternatively, if we are unable to satisfy applicable state licensing requirements, we may be subject to additional regulatory oversight, have our license suspended, or be subject to seizure of assets. Any such events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \"Regulation — Required Licensing.\"\n\nIn addition, as a condition to writing business in certain states, insurers are required to participate in various pools or risk sharing mechanisms or to accept certain classes of risk, regardless of whether such risks meet their underwriting requirements for voluntary business. Some states also limit or impose restrictions on the ability of an insurer to withdraw from certain classes of business. New York, among other states, imposes significant restrictions on a company's ability to materially reduce its exposures or to withdraw from certain lines of business. The state insurance departments can impose significant charges on an insurer in connection with a market withdrawal or refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal of policies or that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may significantly restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. Such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce our potential exposure to hurricane-related losses.\n\nOur European insurance entities, Lemonade Insurance N.V., Lemonade Agency B.V. and Lemonade B.V., are subject to primary supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, \"DNB\") as the supervisory authority of its home member state, the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, \"AFM\"), and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, \"BaFin\") as the supervisory authority of a host member state. DNB and AFM expect firms to avoid actions that jeopardize compliance with their statutory objectives and applicable rules and regulations and have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated firm. When DNB is concerned that an insurer may present a risk, this may lead to negative consequences, including the requirement to maintain a higher level of regulatory capital (via capital \"add-ons\" under the Solvency II Directive) to match the higher perceived risks and enforcement action where the risks identified breach applicable rules and regulations. In the case of a breach of our license requirements or obligations arising from the applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to the DNB and the AFM's sanctions, including (public) formal warnings, orders to adopt a certain course of conduct, incremental penalties and administrative fines, revocation of an undertaking license and, in the case of insurers, where the breach relates to material prudential shortcomings, emergency measures (including the appointment of an administrator or the imposition of measures aimed at winding-up the undertaking). Any such events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \"Business - Regulation - European Regulation.\"\n\n51\n\n\nState insurance regulators impose additional reporting requirements regarding enterprise risk on insurance holding company systems, with which we must comply as an insurance holding company.\n\nWe are subject to the insurance holding company laws of New York, Delaware and California, which require LIC and MIC to register with the NYDFS, DE Dept. and CDI, as applicable, and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of LIC and MIC. These statutes also provide that all transactions among members of a holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of specified types, such transactions require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the NYDFS, DE Dept. or the CDI, as applicable. These prior notification and approval requirements may result in business delays and additional business expenses. If we fail to comply with such requirements or fail to comply with other applicable insurance regulations in New York, Delaware or California, we may be subject to fines and penalties imposed by the applicable state insurance departments.\n\nIn the past decade, various state insurance regulators have increased their focus on risks within an insurer's holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to the insurer. In 2012, the NAIC adopted significant changes to the insurance holding company act and regulations (the \"NAIC Amendments\"). The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. One of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company system's ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an \"enterprise risk report\" that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Other changes include requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control, having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and expanding of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator. The NAIC Amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective. New York State, Delaware and California include a form of the enterprise risk report requirement.\n\nIn 2012, the NAIC also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the \"ORSA Model Act\"). The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company system's Chief Risk Officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (\"ORSA\"). The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer's current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. The ORSA Model Act must be adopted by the individual state legislature and insurance regulators in order to be effective. While New York has not formally passed the ORSA requirement, it has implemented a form \"F\" filing requirement that is the initial response to the ORSA Model Act. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that the NAIC Amendments, compliance with the ORSA Model Act, or any other regulatory requirements may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation.\n\nThe increasing adoption by states of cybersecurity regulations could impose additional compliance burdens on us and expose us to additional liability.\n\nIn response to the growing threat of cyber-attacks in the insurance industry, certain jurisdictions, including New York, have begun to consider new cybersecurity measures, including the adoption of cybersecurity regulations. In March 2017, the NYDFS promulgated Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which requires covered financial institutions, including LIC, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program and implement and maintain cybersecurity policies and procedures with specific requirements. On November 1, 2023, the NYDFS amended the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies to expand such requirements and add new obligations. Additionally, on October 24, 2017, the NAIC adopted its Insurance Data Security Model Law, intended to serve as model legislation for states to enact in order to govern cybersecurity and data protection practices of insurers, insurance agents, and other licensed entities registered under state insurance laws. Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin have adopted versions of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law, each with a different effective date, and other states may adopt versions of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law in the future. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is an EU regulation that entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply as of 17 January 2025. The DORA aims to ensure that financial entities better manage ICT (Information Communication Technologies) risks and become more resilient to \n\n52\n\n\ncyber threats and ICT disruptions. To this end, DORA contains various requirements, including for managing the risks arising from the use of ICT third party service providers. Although we take steps to comply with financial industry cybersecurity regulations and believe we are materially compliant with their requirements, our failure to comply with new or existing cybersecurity regulations could result in regulatory actions and other penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with new or existing cybersecurity regulations could impose significant costs on our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation of Enterprise Risk, Cybersecurity, and Other Recent Developments\".\n\nSevere weather events and other catastrophes, including the effects of climate change and global pandemics, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition.\n\nOur renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Severe weather events include, but are not limited to, winter storms, rain, hail, wild fires and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, fires, and other non-natural events such as explosions, riots, terrorism, or war.\n\nThe incidence and severity of severe weather conditions and catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and the occurrence of one catastrophe does not render the possibility of another catastrophe greater or lower. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. In particular, severe weather and other catastrophes could significantly increase our costs due to a surge in claims following such events and/or legal and regulatory changes in response to catastrophes that may impair our ability to limit our liability under our policies. Severe weather conditions and catastrophes can cause greater losses for us, which can cause our liquidity and financial condition to deteriorate. Resulting reductions in our capital could materially adversely affect our ability to underwrite new insurance policies. In addition, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage at reasonable rates and in amounts adequate to mitigate the risks associated with severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. While we only work with reinsurers whom we believe have acceptable credit, if our reinsurers are unable to pay for the claims for which they are responsible, we could be exposed to additional liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nClimate change may affect the occurrence of certain natural events, such as an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm events, eruptions of volcanoes, and tornado or hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere; more frequent wildfires in certain geographies; higher incidence of deluge flooding and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures. Additionally, climate change may cause an impact on the demand, price and availability of homeowners and renters insurance and reinsurance coverages, as well as the value of our investment portfolio. Due to significant variability associated with future changing climate conditions, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our business.\n\nIn addition, global pandemics may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Any pandemic, epidemic or future outbreak of disease or public health concern, could cause an economic slowdown which could result in an increase in fraudulent claims or a decrease in apartment rentals or home sales, an increase in costs associated with claims under our policies, as well as an increase in the number of customers experiencing difficulty paying premiums, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n53\n\n\nClimate risks, including risks associated with disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal, state and local regulatory agencies have and may continue to propose and enact initiatives related to climate change. Conversely, the federal government has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and indicated reversal of related commitments or policies. Such fragmented policies across jurisdictions, and changes in laws or regulations, may result in increased compliance and administrative costs. Similarly, if new legislation or regulation is enacted, we could incur increased costs and capital expenditures to comply with its limitations, which may impact our financial condition and operating performance.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny, actions and changing expectations from investors, clients, regulators and our employees and other stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may impose additional costs on us, impact our access to capital, or expose us to new or additional risks.\n\nIncreased focus, including from governmental organizations, investors, employees, clients and other stakeholders, on ESG matters such as environmental stewardship, climate change, pay equity, workplace conduct and cybersecurity and data privacy, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance and stakeholder engagement), impact our reputation, or otherwise affect our business performance. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate, if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these issues, including if we fail to demonstrate progress towards any current or future ESG goals. Any harm to our reputation could negatively impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers to do business with us.\n\nESG matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators, including in the U.S., EU, and the UK. In the event divergent ESG disclosure obligations arise between the U.S., UK and the EU, this may also present an increased compliance risk if we are required to comply with different regulatory standards. Additionally, conflicting ESG policies within jurisdictions, such as between federal and some state policies in the U.S., is leading to a complex and fragmented regulatory environment, which may be difficult to navigate. \n\nIt is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. At the same time, certain stakeholders might not be satisfied that we have adopted ESG practices at all, and several states having enacted or proposed \"anti-ESG\" policies or legislation. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG practices and reporting could negatively impact our business. If we do not successfully manage ESG-related expectations across stakeholders, it could erode stakeholder trust, impact our reputation, subject us to shareholder activism or litigation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices.\n\nIn addition, a variety of organizations have developed ratings to measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of some of these assessments are widely publicized. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. In addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ratings of the Company or our industry, as well as omission of inclusion of our stock into ESG-oriented investment funds may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.\n\n54\n\n\nWe expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, our operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality and volatility, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results or in perceptions of our business prospects.\n\nOur revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period and may fail to match expectations as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our results may vary as a result of fluctuations in the number of customers purchasing our insurance products and fluctuations in the timing and amount of our expenses. In addition, the insurance industry, and particularly renters and homeowners insurance, are subject to their own cyclical trends and uncertainties, including extreme weather which is often seasonal and may result in volatility in claims reporting and payment patterns. Fluctuations and variability across the industry may affect our revenue. As a result of the potential variations in our revenue and results of operations, period-to-period comparisons may not be meaningful and the results of any one period should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. In addition, our results of operations may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow us, which may adversely affect our stock price.\n\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and resulting fluctuations in our rate of growth as a result of insurance spending patterns. Specifically, our revenues may be proportionately higher in our third fiscal quarter due to the seasonality of when renters and homeowners move into new homes, which historically occurs in the months of July, August and September. Accordingly, the amount of growth we experience may also be greater in the third quarter. In addition, as our business expands and matures, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality and customer behavior that we experience may change. Volatility in our key operating metrics or their rates of growth could have a negative impact on our financial results and investor perceptions of our business prospects and a failure to achieve our quarterly forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors will cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWe rely on data from our customers and third parties for pricing and underwriting our insurance policies, handling claims and maximizing automation, the unavailability or inaccuracy of which could limit the functionality of our products and disrupt our business.\n\nWe use data, technology and intellectual property licensed from unaffiliated third parties in certain of our products, including insurance industry proprietary information that we license from Insurance Services Office, Inc. (\"ISO\"), and we may license additional third-party technology and intellectual property in the future. Any errors or defects in this third-party technology and intellectual property could result in errors that could harm our brand and business. In addition, licensed technology and intellectual property may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, should ISO refuse to license its proprietary information to us on the same terms that it offers to our competitors, we could be placed at a significant competitive disadvantage.\n\nFurther, although we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for the third-party technology and intellectual property we presently use other than proprietary information provided by ISO, the loss of our right to use any of this technology and intellectual property could result in delays in producing or delivering affected products until equivalent technology or intellectual property is identified, licensed or otherwise procured, and integrated. Our business would be disrupted if any technology and intellectual property we license from others or functional equivalents of this software were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required either to attempt to redesign our products to function with technology and intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in product sales and the release of new product offerings. Alternatively, we might be forced to limit the features available in affected products. Any of these results could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to limitations in the analytical models used to assess and predict our exposure to catastrophe losses.\n\nAlong with others in the insurance industry, models developed internally and by third party vendors are used along with our own historical data in assessing property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses. These models assume various conditions and probability scenarios; however, they do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or measure losses currently incurred. Further, the accuracy of such models may be negatively impacted by changing climate conditions. Catastrophe models use historical information and scientific research about natural events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as detailed information about our in-force business. This information is used in connection with pricing and risk management activities. However, since actual catastrophic events vary considerably, there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting \n\n55\n\n\nperiod. Other limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models, material increases and decreases in results due to model changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and actual conditions that are not yet well understood or may not be properly incorporated into the models.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nWe currently rely on third-party vendors to provide payment processing services, including the processing of payments from credit cards and debit cards, and our business would be disrupted if these vendors become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us and we are unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis. If we or our processing vendor fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if these systems fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers' credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\n\nThe payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data are compromised due to a breach of data, we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur success depends upon the insurance industry continuing to move online at its current pace and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services.\n\nWe provide renters, homeowners, pet, life and car insurance products through our website and our online app that compete with traditional offline counterparts. We do not generally offer insurance through traditional, offline brokers. We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend, to a large extent, on the continued growth in commercial use of the internet and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online.\n\nPurchasers of insurance may develop the perception that purchasing insurance products online is not as effective as purchasing such products through a broker or other traditional offline methods, and the homeowners and renters insurance markets may not migrate online as quickly as (or at the levels that) we expect. Moreover, if, for any reason, an unfavorable perception develops that data automation, artificial intelligence and/or bots are less efficacious than traditional offline methods of purchasing insurance, underwriting, claims processing, and other functions that use data automation, artificial intelligence and/or bots, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nOur actual incurred losses may be greater than our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur financial condition and results of operations depends on our ability to accurately assess potential losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the policies we underwrite. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what the expected ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the current estimate. In our industry, there is always the risk that reserves may prove inadequate as it is possible for us to underestimate the cost of claims and claims administration.\n\nWe base our estimates on our assessment of known facts and circumstances, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, judicial theories of liability, and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events that could increase our exposure to losses, including changes in actuarial projections, claims handling procedures, inflation, severe weather, climate change, economic and judicial trends and legislative changes. We regularly monitor reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of \n\n56\n\n\nstatistical techniques to update our current estimate. Our estimates could prove to be inadequate, and this underestimation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nRecorded claim reserves, including case reserves and incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims reserves, are based on our estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of the circumstances, including settlement agreements. Additionally, models that rely on the assumption that past loss development patterns will persist into the future are used. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, contractual terms and changes in claim reporting, and settlement practices. External factors are also considered, such as court decisions, changes in law and litigation imposing unintended coverage. We also consider benefits, such as disallowing the use of benefit payment schedules, requiring coverage designed to cover losses that occur in a single policy period to losses that develop continuously over multiple policy periods or requiring the availability of multiple limits. Regulatory requirements and economic conditions are also considered.\n\nSince reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process that is regularly refined to reflect current estimation processes and practices. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as the reserves and reinsurance recoverables are reestimated.\n\nIf any of our insurance reserves should prove to be inadequate for the reasons discussed above, or for any other reason, we will be required to increase reserves, resulting in a reduction in our net income and stockholders' equity in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience substantially in excess of established reserves could also have a material adverse effect on future earnings and liquidity and financial rating, which would affect our ability to attract new business or to retain existing customers.\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\n\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of the State of New York and Delaware, respectively. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the NYDFS, or DE Dept., as applicable and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company's total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined using the NAIC's risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\n\nAn insurance company with total adjusted capital that is less than 200% of its authorized control level risk-based capital is at a company action level, which would require the insurance company to file a risk-based capital plan that, among other things, contains proposals of corrective actions the Company intends to take that are reasonably expected to result in the elimination of the Company action level event. Additional action level events occur when the insurer's total adjusted capital falls below 150%, 100%, and 70% of its authorized control level risk-based capital. The lower the percentage, the more severe the regulatory response, including, in the event of a mandatory control level event (total adjusted capital falls below 70% of the insurer's authorized control level risk-based capital), placing the insurance company into receivership. As of December 31, 2024, our risk-based capital ratio was 577% for LIC and 525% for MIC.\n\nOur wholly-owned, Cayman Islands-based captive reinsurer, Lemonade Re SPC, is subject to capital and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”). Although these capital requirements are generally less constraining than U.S. capital requirements, failure to satisfy these requirements could result in regulatory actions from the CIMA or loss of or modification of Lemonade Re SPC’s insurer license, which could adversely impact our ability to improve our overall capital efficiency.\n\nIn addition, our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples of its capital and surplus. The insurance subsidiaries could exceed these ratios if its volume increases faster than anticipated or if its surplus declines due to catastrophe or non-catastrophe losses or excessive underwriting and operational expenses.\n\n57\n\n\nAny failure by our insurance subsidiaries to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations imposed by the laws of the State of New York or Delaware, as applicable (or other states where currently or may in the future conduct business) could subject them to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision, or liquidation.\n\nAny changes in existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements, or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Risk-Based Capital.\"\n\nWe are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds, and mandatory state insurance facilities, which may affect our ability to achieve profitability.\n\nThe insurance laws of many states subject property and casualty insurers doing business in those states to statutory property and casualty guaranty fund assessments. The purpose of a guaranty fund is to protect customers by requiring that solvent property and casualty insurers pay the insurance claims of insolvent insurers. These guaranty associations generally pay these claims by assessing solvent insurers proportionately based on each insurer's share of voluntary premiums written in the state. While most guaranty associations provide for recovery of assessments through subsequent rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits, there is no assurance that insurers will ultimately recover these assessments, which could be material, particularly following a large catastrophe or in markets which become disrupted.\n\nMaximum contributions required by law in any one year vary by state. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments because they depend on factors outside our control, such as insolvencies of other insurance companies. Significant assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Insolvency Funds and Associations, Mandatory Pools, and Insurance Facilities.\"\n\nOur ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business is partially dependent on us maintaining our Demotech, Inc. rating, and may be negatively affected by the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\n\nOur insurance subsidiary, LIC, currently has a Financial Stability Rating (\"FSR\") of 'A' Exceptional from Demotech, Inc., a financial analysis firm that provides FSRs as well as consulting services for property and casualty insurance companies and title underwriters. Demotech, Inc. provides financial stability ratings to insurance companies of all sizes. When providing a rating, Demotech, Inc. evaluates total assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, working capital, administrative expenses, net income, surplus, receivables, amount of business written, industry focus and business model, among others. Below is Demotech, Inc.'s rating scale:\n\n•A\" (A Double Prime), Unsurpassed: 100% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•A' (A Prime), Unsurpassed: 99% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•A, Exceptional: 97% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•S, Substantial: 95% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment;\n\n•M, Moderate: 90% of insurers with this rating are expected to have a positive surplus at least 18 months from the initial date of rating assignment; and\n\n•L, Licensed: These companies have been assessed but have not been given one of the financial strength ratings listed above.\n\n58\n\n\nWhile our Demotech, Inc. rating has proved satisfactory to date, we cannot assure that this rating will remain at its current level and it is possible that some prospective customers may be reluctant to do business with a company that is not rated by A.M. Best. We have not been reviewed by A.M. Best and do not currently intend to seek a rating from A.M. Best. Unlike Demotech, Inc., A.M. Best may penalize companies that are highly leveraged, including those companies that utilize reinsurance to support premium writings. We do not plan to give up revenues or efficiency of size as a means to qualify for an acceptable A.M. Best rating. Not having an A.M. Best rating may prevent us from expanding our business or limit our access to credit from certain financial institutions, which may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies.\n\nPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. We seek to hold a diversified portfolio of investments in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by our Investment Committee. However, our investments are subject to general economic and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities.\n\nOur primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Part II Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” A protracted low interest rate environment could place pressure on our net investment income, particularly as it relates to fixed income securities and short-term investments, which, in turn, may adversely affect our operating results. A protracted high interest rate environment could cause the values of our fixed income securities portfolios to decline, with the magnitude of the decline depending on the duration of securities included in our portfolio and the amount by which interest rates increase. Some fixed income securities have call or prepayment options, which create possible reinvestment risk in declining rate environments. Other fixed income securities, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk or, in a rising interest rate environment, may not prepay as quickly as expected.\n\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities we hold, or due to deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer's payments on such investments. Downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities also have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities.\n\nSuch factors could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. Our investment portfolio is subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the securities we hold in our portfolio does not reflect prices at which actual transactions would occur.\n\nWe may also invest in marketable equity securities. These securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value and are subject to potential losses and declines in market value.\n\nRisks for all types of securities are managed through the application of our investment policy, which establishes investment parameters that include, but are not limited to, maximum percentages of investment in certain types of securities and minimum levels of credit quality, which we believe are within applicable guidelines established by the NAIC, the NYDFS and the DE Department.\n\nAlthough we seek to preserve our capital, we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. In addition, although we seek to employ investment strategies that are not correlated with our insurance and reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate the adverse effect of the losses on us.\n\n59\n\n\nUnexpected changes in the interpretation of our coverage or provisions, including loss limitations and exclusions, in our policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSpecifically negotiated loss limitations or exclusions in our policies may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. For example, many of our policies limit the period during which a customer may bring a claim, which may be shorter than the statutory period under which such claims can be brought against our customers. While these limitations and exclusions help us assess and mitigate our loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void a limitation or exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such limitations or exclusions. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated loss and loss adjustment expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, court decisions could read policy exclusions narrowly so as to expand coverage, thereby requiring insurers to create and write new exclusions. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Existence as a Public Benefit Corporation\n\nWe operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation. As a public benefit corporation, we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to produce a public benefit or benefits and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, balancing our stockholders' pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or benefits identified by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amended Charter”). There is no assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose or that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to publicly disclose a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.\n\nIf we lose our certification as a Certified B Corp or our publicly reported B Corp score declines, or if state or federal regulators restrict, delay or otherwise interfere with our ability to make charitable contributions, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur business model and brand could be harmed if we were to lose our certification as a Certified B Corp or if state or federal regulators impede or otherwise delay or restrict our ability to make charitable contributions. Certified B Corp status is a certification that requires us to consider the impact of our decisions on our workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment. We believe that Certified B Corp status has allowed us to build credibility and trust among our customers. Whether due to our choice or our failure to meet B Lab's certification requirements, any change in our status could create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corp. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corp score declines and there is a perception that we are no longer committed to the Certified B Corp standards. Similarly, our reputation could be harmed if we take actions that are perceived to be misaligned with B Lab's values. See \"Business — Certified B Corp Status.\"\n\nFurthermore, state or federal regulators could restrict, delay, or otherwise interfere with our ability to contribute the residual amount left over after paying claims and reinsurance to nonprofits selected by our customers. This could erode customer trust in our products and services, weaken incentives for good customer behavior, and drive down demand for our products and services.\n\nAny such harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n60\n\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively impact our financial performance.\n\nUnlike traditional corporations, which have a fiduciary duty to focus exclusively on maximizing stockholder value, our directors have a fiduciary duty to consider not only the stockholders' interests, but also the Company's specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by our actions. Therefore, we may take actions that we believe will be in the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our specific benefit purpose, even if those actions do not maximize our financial results. While we intend for this public benefit designation and obligation to provide an overall net benefit to us and our customers, it could instead cause us to make decisions and take actions without seeking to maximize the income generated from our business, and hence available for distribution to our stockholders. Our pursuit of longer-term or non-pecuniary benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all, yet may have an immediate negative effect on any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are less attractive as a takeover target than a traditional company would be and, therefore, your ability to realize your investment through an acquisition may be limited. Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation cannot merge or consolidate with another entity if, as a result of such merger or consolidation, the surviving entity's charter \"does not contain the identical provisions identifying the public benefit or public benefits,\" unless the transaction receives approval from two-thirds of the target public benefit corporation's outstanding voting shares. Additionally, public benefit corporations may also not be attractive targets for activists or hedge fund investors because new directors would still have to consider and give appropriate weight to the public benefit along with shareholder value, and shareholders committed to the public benefit can enforce this through derivative suits. Further, by requiring that board of directors of public benefit corporations consider additional constituencies other than maximizing shareholder value, Delaware public benefit corporation law could potentially make it easier for a board to reject a hostile bid, even where the takeover would provide the greatest short-term financial yield to investors.\n\nOur directors have a fiduciary duty to consider not only our stockholders' interests, but also our specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by our actions. If a conflict between such interests arises, there is no guarantee such a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders.\n\nWhile directors of traditional corporations are required to make decisions they believe to be in the best interests of their stockholders, directors of a public benefit corporation have a fiduciary duty to consider not only the stockholders' interests, but also the company's specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders affected by the company's actions. Under Delaware law, directors are shielded from liability for breach of these obligations if they make informed and disinterested decisions that serve a rational purpose. Thus, unlike traditional corporations which must focus exclusively on stockholder value, our directors are not merely permitted, but obligated, to consider our specific public benefit and the interests of other stakeholders. In the event of a conflict between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of our specific public benefit or our other stakeholders, our directors must only make informed and disinterested decisions that serve a rational purpose; thus, there is no guarantee such a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nAs a Delaware public benefit corporation, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our duty to balance stockholder and public benefit interest, the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nStockholders of a Delaware public benefit corporation (if they, individually or collectively, own at least two percent of the company's outstanding shares) are entitled to file a derivative lawsuit claiming the directors failed to balance stockholder and public benefit interests. This potential liability does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore, we may be subject to the possibility of increased derivative litigation, which would require the attention of our management, and, as a result, may adversely impact our management's ability to effectively execute our strategy. Additionally, any such derivative litigation may be costly, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n61\n\n\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Warrants\n\nThe market price of our common stock and warrants may be volatile or decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you initially paid for our common stock.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock and warrants could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and included elsewhere in this document may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock and warrants:\n\n•the occurrence of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes;\n\n•our operating and financial performance, quarterly or annual earnings relative to similar companies;\n\n•publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\n•the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\n•announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships;\n\n•any major change in our board of directors or senior management, including the departure of either of our Co-Founders;\n\n•additional sales of our common stock and warrants by us, our directors, executive officers, principal shareholders, or our Co-Founders;\n\n•adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\n•short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock and warrants;\n\n•exposure to capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, realized investment losses, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and performance of insurance- linked investments;\n\n•our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance, and prospects;\n\n•our dividend policy and whether dividends on our common stock and warrants have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;\n\n•perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\n•regulatory or legal developments;\n\n•changes in general market, economic, and political conditions;\n\n•conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;\n\n•short selling activities\n\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\n•threatened or actual litigation or government investigations.\n\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock and warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance, and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. In addition, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\n\nProvisions in our Amended Charter and our Amended Bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\n•our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n\n•nothing in our Amended Charter precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock;\n\n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\n•our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\n62\n\n\n•only our chairman of the board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president (in the absence of the chief executive officer), or a majority of the board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\n•no provision in our Amended Charter or Amended Bylaws provides for cumulative voting, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\n•directors will only be able to be removed for cause;\n\n•certain amendments to our Amended Charter will require the approval of two-thirds of the then outstanding voting power of our capital stock;\n\n•our Amended Bylaws will provide that the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock, voting as a single class, is required for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n\n•our Amended Charter authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of our capital stock; and\n\n•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\n\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire. \n\nApplicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control.\n\nUnder applicable state insurance laws and regulations, no person may acquire control of a domestic insurer until written approval is obtained from the state insurance commissioner following a public hearing on the proposed acquisition. Such approval would be contingent upon the state insurance commissioner's consideration of a number of factors including, among others, the financial strength of the proposed acquiror, the acquiror's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti- competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. LIC is domiciled in New York and MIC is domiciled in Delaware. Per the applicable laws and regulations of New York and Delaware, respectively, generally no person may acquire control of any insurer, whether by purchase of its securities or otherwise, unless it gives prior notice to the insurer and has received prior approval from the superintendent or Commissioner of Financial Services. Under New York and Delaware insurance law, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. These requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of Lemonade, Inc., including through transactions that some or all of the stockholders might consider to be desirable. \n\nOur Amended Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\n\nOur Amended Charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or to any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. By becoming a stockholder in the Company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Amended Charter related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our Amended Charter may limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Additionally, the enforceability of choice of forum provisions in other companies’ governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Amended\n\nCharter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If so, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n63\n\n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the NYSE and the NYSE American regarding our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\n\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the New York Stock Exchange American (“NYSE American”). These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Such reporting obligations place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as our personnel. \n\nIn addition, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting by the time our second annual report is filed with the SEC and thereafter, which will require us to document and make changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(b) requires our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nWe expect to continue to incur costs related to implementing an internal audit and compliance function in the upcoming years to further enhance our internal control environment. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the demands placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.\n\nWe depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations, and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law.\n\nWe are a holding company that transacts a majority of our business through operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our operating and financing cash needs depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries, and upon the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.\n\nPayments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. The limitations are based on income and surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, not GAAP. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future, including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future. Our insurance subsidiaries may also face competitive pressures in the future to maintain insurance financial stability or strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements would affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments and we may not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our obligations. See \"Business - Regulation of Our Business — Restrictions on Paying Dividends.\"\n\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\n\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, for the future operation and expansion of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations (including our ability to generate cash flow in excess of expenses and our expected or actual net income), liquidity, cash requirements, financial condition, retained earnings and collateral and capital requirements, general business conditions, contractual restrictions, legal, tax and regulatory limitations, the effect of a dividend or dividends upon our financial strength ratings, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. See \"Dividends.\"\n\n64\n\n\nBecause we are a holding company and all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, dividends, distributions and other payments from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries will be our principal sources of cash to fund operations and pay dividends. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any of our future debt or preferred equity securities or our subsidiaries. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of shares of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants may ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.\n\nThe exercise price for Metromile’s warrants that were assumed by us in connection with the Metromile Merger is $281.51 per share. The warrants may not be in the money prior to their expiration and, as such, they may expire worthless. These warrants are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “LMND-WS.”\n\nThe terms of the warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to the holders. The warrant agreement, as amended, between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as warrant agent, and us, as successor thereunder following the consummation of the Metromile Merger (the “Metromile Warrant Agreement”), provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants (as defined in the Metromile Warrant Agreement) to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. Such amendments could significantly diminish the value of the warrants, reduce the likelihood of them being exercised profitably, and ultimately result in the warrants expiring worthless.\n\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\n\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (excluding any Placement Warrants (as defined the Metromile Warrant Agreement) held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our common stock in the event the shares of our common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of our common stock equals or exceeds $342.01 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and the like) on each of 20 trading days within the 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeems the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise its redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force a warrant holder: (i) to exercise its warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for it to do so, (ii) to sell its warrants at the then-current market price when it might otherwise wish to hold its warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, will be substantially less than the market value of its warrants\n\n65\n\n\nConcentrated ownership of our common stock could limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. This concentration may create a risk of sudden changes in our common stock price.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp. beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 14.7% of our outstanding common stock, corresponding to 9.9% of the total voting rights in our Company under our Amended Charter. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of the Company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the sale by a major shareholder of a significant portion of their holdings (particularly entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp.) could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In November 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering all of the shares of our common stock then held by entities affiliated with SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock or warrants may not be sustained, which may cause our common stock or warrants to trade at a discount from the public offering price and make it difficult for you to sell the common stock or warrants you purchase.\n\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will sustain a trading market on the NYSE and NYSE American or how active and liquid that market may remain. If an active and liquid trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock or warrants that you purchase at a price above the price you purchase it or at all. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to continue would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock or warrants. The market price of our common stock or warrants may decline below the public offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our markets, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could materially decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets, or our competitors. Analysts may not continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.",
