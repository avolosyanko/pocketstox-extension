BUSINESS\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe are a California-based holding company with energy infrastructure investments in North America. Our businesses invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers.\n\nSempra was formed in 1998 through a business combination of Enova Corporation and Pacific Enterprises, the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in California: SDG&E, which began operations in 1881, and SoCalGas, which began operations in 1867. We have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into Texas through our 80.25% interest in Oncor and 50% interest in Sharyland Utilities. Sempra Infrastructure’s assets include investments in the U.S. and Mexico with a focus on LNG, energy networks and low carbon solutions.\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\nOur mission is to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company. We are primarily focused on transmission and distribution investments, among other areas, that we believe are capable of producing stable cash flows and earnings visibility, with the goals of delivering safe, reliable and increasingly clean forms of energy affordably to customers and increasing shareholder value.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT\n\nSempra’s business activities are organized under the following reportable segments:\n\n▪Sempra California\n\n▪Sempra Texas Utilities\n\n▪Sempra Infrastructure\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas each has one reportable segment.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  12\n\n\nSempra California\n\nSDG&E\n\nSDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 3.6 million and natural gas services to approximately 3.3 million of that population, covering an approximate 4,100 square mile service territory in Southern California that encompasses San Diego County and an adjacent portion of Orange County. \n\nSDG&E’s assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\n\nWe describe SDG&E’s electric utility operations below. We describe SDG&E’s natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SDG&E’s business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\n\nElectric Transmission and Distribution System. Service to SDG&E’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system, which includes substations and overhead and underground lines. These electric facilities are primarily in the San Diego, Imperial and Orange counties of California, and in Arizona and Nevada and consisted of 2,021 miles of transmission lines, 24,149 miles of distribution lines and 159 substations at December 31, 2024. Occasionally, various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety. \n\nSDG&E’s 500-kV Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,163 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed by SDG&E and operated by the California ISO. Both of these lines together provide SDG&E with import capability of 3,900 MW of power.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  13\n\n\nMexico’s Baja California transmission system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction. However, it can be less under certain system conditions.\n\nSDG&E’s system is connected to Edison’s transmission system via five 230-kV transmission lines.\n\nElectric Resources. SDG&E supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a long-term basis from other suppliers for resale through CPUC-approved PPAs or purchases on the spot market. SDG&E does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes. SDG&E’s electric resources at December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n\nELECTRIC RESOURCES(1)\n\nContract expiration dateNet operating capacity (MW)% of total\n\nSDG&E:\n\nOwned generation facilities, natural gas(2)\n\n1,204 24 %\n\nPPAs:\n\nRenewable energy:\n\nWind2025 to 2042918 19 \n\nSolar2030 to 20421,526 31 \n\nOther2025 and thereafter155 3 \n\nTolling and other2025 to 20421,113 23 \n\nTotal4,916 100 %\n\n(1)    Excludes approximately 367 MW of energy storage owned and approximately 632 MW of energy storage contracted.\n\n(2)    SDG&E owns and operates four natural gas-fired power plants, three of which are in California and one is in Nevada.\n\nCharges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. Tolling contracts are PPAs under which SDG&E provides natural gas to the energy supplier. \n\nSDG&E procures natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with PPAs. Purchases from various southwestern U.S. suppliers are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices, which can be subject to volatility.\n\nSDG&E participates in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Participants can make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk.\n\nCustomers and Demand. SDG&E provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes: \n\nELECTRIC CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\n\nCustomer meter countVolumes(1)\n\n(millions of kWh)\n\nDecember 31,Years ended December 31,\n\n2024202420232022\n\nSDG&E:\n\nResidential285,881 1,348 2,004 3,940 \n\nCommercial31,313 1,363 1,868 2,850 \n\nIndustrial319 441 670 909 \n\nStreet and highway lighting1,574 55 77 101 \n\n319,087 3,207 4,619 7,800 \n\nCCA and DA1,213,258 13,484 12,228 9,900 \n\nTotal1,532,345 16,691 16,847 17,700 \n\n(1)    Includes intercompany sales.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  14\n\n\nSDG&E currently provides procurement service for a portion of its customer load. Most customers receive electric procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG&E no longer procures energy for this departed load. Accordingly, SDG&E’s CCA and DA customers receive primarily transportation and distribution services from SDG&E.\n\nCCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program, and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Several jurisdictions in SDG&E’s territory have implemented CCA, including the City of San Diego in 2022. Additional jurisdictions may be considering CCA.\n\nAs a result of customers electing CCA and DA services, SDG&E’s historical energy procurement commitments for future deliveries exceed the needs of its remaining bundled customers. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether customers’ energy is procured by SDG&E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The framework is intended to more equitably allocate SDG&E’s procurement cost obligations among customers served by SDG&E and customers now served by CCA and DA.\n\nSan Diego’s mild climate and SDG&E’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers. Rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by SDG&E. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in SDG&E’s territory totaled 2,318 MW, 2,154 MW and 1,864 MW, respectively.\n\nElectricity demand is dependent on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, renewable power generation, the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, demand-side management impact and DER. California’s energy policy supports increased electrification, particularly electrification of vehicles, which could significantly increase sales volumes in the coming years. Other external factors, such as the price of purchased power, the use and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, the development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for and supply of natural gas and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity, which may in turn impact demand. Electricity demand is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns (or “seasonality”), tending to increase in the summer months to meet the cooling load and in the winter months to meet the heating load.\n\nCompetition. SDG&E faces competition to serve its customer load from distributed and local power generation growth, including DER. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. Certain FERC transmission development projects are open to competition, allowing independent developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  15\n\n\nSoCalGas\n\nSoCalGas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system that delivers natural gas to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 21.1 million, covering an approximate 24,000 square mile service territory that encompasses Southern California and portions of central California (excluding San Diego County, the City of Long Beach and the desert area of San Bernardino County).\n\nSoCalGas’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\n\nWe describe SoCalGas’ natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SoCalGas’ business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\n\nSempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations\n\nNatural Gas Procurement and Transportation. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas’ natural gas facilities included 3,037 miles of transmission and storage pipelines, 52,567 miles of distribution pipelines, 48,999 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations, and SDG&E’s natural gas facilities consisted of 188 miles of transmission pipelines, 9,201 miles of distribution pipelines, 6,794 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station.\n\nSoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s gas transmission pipelines interconnect with four major interstate pipeline systems: El Paso Natural Gas, Transwestern Pipeline, Kern River Pipeline Company, and Mojave Pipeline Company, allowing customers to bring gas supplies into the SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system from the various out-of-state gas producing basins. Additionally, an interconnection with PG&E’s intrastate gas transmission pipeline system allows gas to flow into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system. SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system also has an interconnect with a Mexican gas pipeline company at Otay Mesa on the California/Mexico border that allows gas to not only flow south from the gas producing basins in the southwestern U.S., but to also flow north into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system from supplies in Mexico. There are also several in-state gas interconnections allowing for delivery of California-produced gas, including a number of direct connections from biomethane producers.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  16\n\n\nSoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts and on the spot market for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid week indices, which can be subject to volatility. The cost of purchases of natural gas for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers is billed to those customers without markup.\n\nTo support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm and variable interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed and variable tariffed and negotiated reservation charges to reserve firm and interruptible transportation rights. Energy companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas.\n\nNatural Gas Storage. SoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 Bcf and 126 injection, withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage service. SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s core customers, along with certain third-party market participants, are allocated a portion of SoCalGas’ storage capacity. SoCalGas uses the remaining storage capacity for load balancing services for all customers and for storage for noncore customers. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 Bcf and, subject to CPUC limitations, represents 63% of SoCalGas’ working natural gas storage capacity. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas has been authorized by the CPUC to utilize up to 68.6 Bcf of working gas at the facility.\n\nCustomers and Demand. SoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and SDG&E’s territory on a combined portfolio basis. SoCalGas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others.\n\nNATURAL GAS CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\n\nCustomer meter countVolumes (Bcf)(1)\n\nDecember 31,Years ended December 31,\n\n2024202420232022\n\nSDG&E:\n\nResidential\n\n886,031 \n\nCommercial\n\n29,009 \n\nElectric generation and transportation\n\n3,312 \n\nNatural gas sales\n\n45 48 45 \n\nTransportation\n\n38 39 39 \n\nTotal\n\n918,352 83 87 84 \n\nSoCalGas:\n\nResidential\n\n5,940,904 \n\nCommercial \n\n248,866 \n\nIndustrial\n\n23,833 \n\nElectric generation and wholesale\n\n38 \n\nNatural gas sales\n\n304 321 304 \n\nTransportation\n\n522 549 586 \n\nTotal\n\n6,213,641 826 870 890 \n\n(1)    Includes intercompany sales.\n\nFor regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers.\n\nMost core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase their natural gas supplies from producers, marketers or brokers, SoCalGas and SDG&E are obligated to maintain adequate delivery capacity to serve the requirements of all their core customers. \n\nSoCalGas’ noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, and large commercial and industrial customers. A portion of SoCalGas’ noncore customers are non-end-users, which include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities, including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  17\n\n\nNoncore customers are responsible for procuring their natural gas requirements, as the regulatory framework does not allow SoCalGas and SDG&E to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers.\n\nNatural gas demand largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of, demand for, and supply sources of electricity, the use of and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside California, storage levels, transport capacity and availability of supply into California and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of natural gas, which may in turn impact demand.\n\nOne of the larger drivers of natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in self-generation from rooftop solar, the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s service areas. The demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity, such as renewable energy sources. Given the significant level and availability of natural gas-fired generation, we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can continue to help provide electric reliability in our California service territories.\n\nThe natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality. Demand for natural gas in our service territory typically rises during the winter months to accommodate heating needs and the summer months to support peak electric generation. As is prevalent in the industry, subject to regulatory limitations, SoCalGas typically injects natural gas into storage during the months of April through October and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the months of November through March.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  18\n\n\nSempra Texas Utilities \n\nSempra Texas Utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings. Oncor Holdings is a wholly owned entity of Sempra that owns an 80.25% interest in Oncor. TTI owns the remaining 19.75% interest in Oncor. Sempra owns a 50% interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a 100% interest in Sharyland Utilities.\n\nSempra Texas Utilities’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory: \n\nFor a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\n\nOncor\n\nOncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution utility that operates in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. Oncor delivers electricity to end-use consumers through its electrical systems and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in Texas. Oncor’s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities, including the \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  19\n\n\ncities of Dallas and Fort Worth and surrounding suburbs, as well as Waco, Wichita Falls, Odessa, Midland, Tyler, Temple, Killeen and Round Rock, among others. Most of Oncor’s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways, streets and rights-of-way pursuant to permits, public utility easements, franchise or other agreements or as otherwise permitted by law. \n\nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor had 5,094 employees, including 836 employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement and excluding interns.\n\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, which we describe in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” are in effect and are intended to enhance Oncor Holdings’ and Oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of, or other adverse financial developments affecting, their owners. Sempra does not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends or other distributions, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions, including limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors. Because Oncor Holdings and Oncor are managed independently (i.e., ring-fenced), we account for our 100% ownership interest in Oncor Holdings as an equity method investment.\n\nElectricity Transmission. Oncor’s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations. These responsibilities consist of the construction, maintenance and security of transmission facilities and substations and the monitoring, controlling and dispatching of high-voltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ERCOT, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” \n\nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor’s transmission system included approximately 18,324 circuit miles of transmission lines, a total of 1,288 transmission and distribution substations, and interconnection to 192 third-party generation facilities totaling 58,597 MW. \n\nTransmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the PUCT or, to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets, the FERC. Network transmission revenues compensate Oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kV and above. Other services offered by Oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies, facilities studies, transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment, substations and transmission lines owned by other parties. \n\nElectricity Distribution. Oncor’s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities, including electricity delivery, power quality, security and system reliability. These responsibilities consist of the ownership, management, construction, maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area. Oncor’s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to end-users and wholesale customers through 3,757 distribution feeders at December 31, 2024.\n\nOncor’s distribution system included more than four million points of delivery at December 31, 2024 and consisted of 125,975 circuit miles of overhead and underground lines.\n\nDistribution revenues from residential and small business users are generally based on actual monthly consumption (kWh) and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on, depending on size and annual load factor, either actual monthly demand (kW) or the greater of actual monthly demand (kW) or 80% of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months. \n\nCustomers and Demand. Oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas based on the number of end-use customers and miles of transmission and distribution lines, delivering electricity to more than four million homes and businesses, operating more than 144,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines as of December 31, 2024 in a territory with an estimated population of approximately 13 million. The majority of consumers of the electricity Oncor delivers are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business. Oncor is not a seller of electricity, nor does it purchase electricity for resale. Rather, Oncor provides wholesale transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as non-affiliated electricity distribution companies, electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. Oncor also provides distribution services, consisting of retail delivery services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to end-use customers, as well as wholesale delivery services to electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. At December 31, 2024, Oncor’s distribution business customers primarily consisted of over 100 retail electric providers that sell the electricity it distributes to consumers in its certificated service areas.\n\nOncor’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers, with revenues being highest in the summer. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  20\n\n\nCompetition. Oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the PUCT. The majority of Oncor’s service territory is single certificated, with Oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider. However, in multi-certificated areas of Texas, Oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve end-use customers. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party DER and other technologies may increasingly compete with Oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers.\n\nSharyland Utilities\n\nSharyland Utilities is a regulated electric transmission utility that owns and operates, at December 31, 2024, approximately 64 miles of electric transmission lines in south Texas, including a direct current line connecting Mexico and assets in McAllen, Texas. Sharyland Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient transmission and substation services and investing to support infrastructure needs in its service territory, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” Transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\n\nSempra Infrastructure\n\nOur Sempra Infrastructure segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary, SI Partners, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. SI Partners is included within our Sempra Infrastructure reportable segment but is not the same in its entirety as the reportable segment. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help provide safe, sustainable and reliable access to cleaner energy in markets in the U.S., Mexico and globally.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra, KKR Pinnacle and ADIA each hold a 70%, 20%, and 10% interest, respectively, in SI Partners. SI Partners owns a 100% interest in Sempra LNG Holding, LP and a 99.9% interest in IEnova at December 31, 2024. \n\nThe minority partners in SI Partners and Sempra are parties to the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of SI Partners (the LP Agreement). Under the LP Agreement, matters are decided generally by majority vote and the managers designated by the partners of SI Partners each vote on an equity-weighted basis based on the ownership percentage of their respective designating limited partner. SI Partners and its controlled subsidiaries are prohibited from taking certain limited actions without the prior written approval of the minority partners. The LP Agreement contains certain default remedies if any limited partner fails to fund any amounts required to be funded under the LP Agreement and requires that SI Partners distribute to the limited partners at least 85% of distributable cash of SI Partners and its subsidiaries on a quarterly basis, subject to certain exceptions and reserves. Generally, distributions from SI Partners are made on a pro rata basis. However, KKR Pinnacle is entitled to certain priority distributions in the event of material deviations between certain specified projected cash flows and actual cash flows. Additionally, the minority partners are entitled to certain priority distributions in the event a specified project that reaches a positive final investment decision does not have projected internal rates of return greater than a specified threshold or in the event Sempra has not made a positive final investment decision by a certain date on specified LNG projects that are under development. Under the LP Agreement, if the minority partners approve Sempra’s request that a project not be pursued jointly, or if the minority partners decide not to participate in any proposed project for which Sempra nevertheless desires to make a positive final investment decision, then Sempra may proceed with such project either independently through a different investment vehicle or as a “Sole Risk Project” within SI Partners and receive Sole Risk Interests in respect thereof. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at Sempra’s sole cost, expense and liability, and Sempra receives, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, the economic and other benefits, if any, from such projects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure consolidates Sempra’s ownership and management of its non-U.S. utility, energy infrastructure assets in North America under a single platform. These assets include LNG and natural gas infrastructure in the U.S. and Mexico and renewable energy, LPG and refined products infrastructure in Mexico, which are managed through three business lines: LNG, Energy Networks and Low Carbon Solutions.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  21\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure owned or held interests in the following assets:\n\nFor a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Sempra Infrastructure’s business, see “Part 1 – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  22\n\n\nLNG\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s LNG business line is comprised of a natural gas liquefaction and regasification portfolio in operation, construction or development, and is focused on securely delivering natural gas to markets around the world. Sempra Infrastructure’s development and/or construction of projects, which we describe below, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nCameron LNG Phase 1 Facility. SI Partners owns 50.2% of Cameron LNG JV, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 35.1% interest in the JV. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, an affiliate of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment, LLC (a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) each own 16.6% of Cameron LNG JV. We account for our ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. No single owner controls or can unilaterally direct significant activities of Cameron LNG JV.\n\nCameron LNG JV owns and operates the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, a natural gas liquefaction, export, regasification and import facility with three natural gas pre-treatment, processing and liquefaction trains. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility is located in Hackberry, Louisiana, along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which handles significant industrial shipping, including large oil and LNG tankers, that we believe is well positioned to supply the Atlantic and Pacific markets. The three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an export capacity of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., which collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility.\n\nECA Regas Facility. SI Partners owns and operates the ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico, which is capable of processing one Bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320,000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160,000 cubic meters each.\n\nThe ECA Regas Facility generates revenues from firm storage service fees under firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively, which permit them to collectively use 50% of the terminal’s capacity, with the remaining 50% of the capacity available for Sempra Infrastructure’s use. The land on which the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects under construction and in development are expected to be situated, as well as land adjacent to those properties, are the subject of litigation. We discuss litigation, regulatory and other matters that could impact the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \n\nSempra Infrastructure uses its 50% capacity at the ECA Regas Facility to satisfy its obligation under an LNG SPA with Tangguh PSC through 2029, which we discuss below, and ECA LNG Phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter.\n\nECA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners owns an 83.4% interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 58.4% interest in the project. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6% interest in the project. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the spring of 2026.\n\nECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG.\n\nPA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners, KKR Denali and an affiliate of ConocoPhillips own a 28%, 42% and 30% interest, respectively, in the PA LNG Phase 1 project under construction on a greenfield site in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. Sempra Infrastructure holds a 19.6% interest in the project. The PA LNG Phase 1 project will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa. We expect the first and second trains of the PA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in 2027 and 2028, respectively.\n\nPA LNG Phase 1 has definitive SPAs with an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG, RWE Supply & Trading GmbH for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG, INEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG, ORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG, and ENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  23\n\n\nKKR Denali’s interest in the PA LNG Phase 1 project is governed by a limited liability company agreement under which (i) a subsidiary of SI Partners (a) is the managing member, (b) exclusively holds the right to make decisions with respect to certain expansions, such as the potential PA LNG Phase 2 project, (c) has certain rights to preferential distributions from specified revenues and expansion true-up payments, and (d) through a parent entity that is a subsidiary of Sempra, bears a disproportionately higher allocation of certain capital contribution commitments in certain budgetary overrun scenarios, and (ii) KKR Denali has certain investor protection voting rights.\n\nAsset and Supply Optimization. Sempra Infrastructure has an LNG SPA through 2029 with Tangguh PSC for the supply of the equivalent of 500 MMcf of natural gas per day at a price based on the SoCal Border index for natural gas. The LNG SPA allows Tangguh PSC to divert certain LNG volumes to other global markets in exchange for payments of diversion fees. Sempra Infrastructure may also enter into short-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at the ECA Regas Facility for sale to other parties. Sempra Infrastructure uses the natural gas produced from this LNG to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the CFE at prices that are based on the SoCal Border index. If LNG volumes received from Tangguh PSC are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the CFE, Sempra Infrastructure may purchase natural gas in the market to satisfy such commitment.\n\nSempra Infrastructure purchases, transports and sells natural gas and LNG, and has customers in both the U.S. and Mexico, including the CFE. Sempra Infrastructure may also purchase natural gas from other Sempra affiliates. Natural gas purchases and transportation arrangements are substantially backed by long-term, U.S. dollar-based contracts for the sale of natural gas to third parties (both U.S. sourced and derived from imported LNG), LNG offtake and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity.\n\nLNG Projects Under Development. Sempra Infrastructure is pursuing or evaluating the following development opportunities:\n\n▪Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, an expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility that would add one liquefaction train and debottlenecking capacity from the existing three trains\n\n▪ECA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project to be located at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico\n\n▪PA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure to be located adjacent to the PA LNG Phase 1 project in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas\n\n▪Vista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure in the vicinity of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico\n\nNo final investment decision has been reached for any of these potential projects.\n\nDemand and Competition. North America benefits from numerous competitive advantages as a potential supplier of LNG to world markets, including the following:\n\n▪high levels of developed and undeveloped natural gas resources, including unconventional natural gas and oil relative to domestic consumption levels\n\n▪flexible and mature oil and gas markets resulting in efficient unit costs of gas production\n\n▪availability of extensive natural gas pipeline transmission systems and natural gas storage capacity with proximity to production locations\n\nGlobal LNG demand and competition may limit North American LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match North American LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. North American LNG exports add market flexibility that is expected to facilitate additional growth of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG.\n\nOur LNG projects in development, under construction and in operation all compete globally to market and sell LNG to remarketers and end-users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG-importing countries around the world. We compete with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe. \n\nEnergy Networks \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s Energy Networks business line is comprised of a natural gas transportation and distribution network.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  24\n\n\nCross-Border Interconnections and In-Country Pipelines. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in systems for the receipt, transportation, compression and delivery of natural gas and ethane. At December 31, 2024, these systems consisted of 1,985 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, 17 natural gas compression stations and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in Mexico. The design capacity of these pipeline assets is over 16,900 MMcf per day of natural gas, 204 MMcf per day of ethane gas and 106,000 barrels per day of ethane liquid. Capacity on Sempra Infrastructure’s pipelines and related assets is substantially contracted under long-term, U.S. dollar-based agreements with major industry participants such as the CFE, Centro Nacional de Control de Gas, PEMEX and other similar counterparties. See “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure” for a discussion about Sempra Infrastructure’s Sonora pipeline.\n\nSempra Infrastructure owns a 40-mile natural gas pipeline in south Louisiana, the Cameron Interstate Pipeline, which links the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility in Cameron Parish in Louisiana to seven pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in Texas and the northeast, midcontinent and southeast regions of the U.S. The majority of transportation capacity on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline is under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers for delivery to the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility.\n\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, a 72-mile pipeline connecting the PA LNG Phase 1 project to Gillis, Louisiana. We expect the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector to be ready for service ahead of the PA LNG Phase 1 project’s gas requirements.\n\nNatural Gas Distribution. Sempra Infrastructure owns the natural gas distribution regulated utility, Ecogas, which operates in three separate distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico. At December 31, 2024, Ecogas had approximately 3,142 miles of distribution pipeline, and approximately 163,000 customer meters serving more than 628,000 residential, commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 10 MMcf per day in 2024. Ecogas relies on supply and transportation services, including from Sempra Infrastructure and SoCalGas for the natural gas it distributes to its customers.\n\nLPG Storage and Associated Systems. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TDF, S. de R. L. de C. V. (TDF) pipeline system and the Guadalajara LPG terminal. At December 31, 2024, the TDF pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of 12-inch diameter LPG pipeline with a design capacity of 34,000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities. The TDF pipeline system runs from PEMEX’s Burgos facility in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Mexico to Sempra Infrastructure’s approximately 32,000-barrel LPG storage facility near the city of Monterrey, Mexico and is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2027. Sempra Infrastructure’s Guadalajara LPG terminal is an 80,000-barrel LPG storage facility near Guadalajara, Mexico, with associated loading and dispatch facilities, and serves the LPG needs of Guadalajara. The Guadalajara LPG terminal is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2028. Both contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for inflation.\n\nRefined Products and Natural Gas Storage. Sempra Infrastructure’s refined products storage business develops, constructs and operates systems for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products, principally gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, throughout the Mexican states of Baja California, Colima, Estado de Mexico, Puebla, Sinaloa and Veracruz for private companies, with a combined storage capacity of 4.6 million barrels fully operating as of December 31, 2024. The Topolobampo marine terminal commenced commercial operations in June 2024. Our customer contracts for our refined products storage business are structured as long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated, firm capacity storage agreements with counterparties including Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation and PEMEX. The contracted rate under these contracts is independent from each terminal’s regulated rate as determined by the CRE.\n\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing Louisiana Storage, a 12.5-Bcf salt dome natural gas storage facility to support the PA LNG Phase 1 project. The construction includes an 11-mile pipeline that will connect to the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. We expect Louisiana Storage to be ready for service in time to support the needs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\n\nDemand and Competition. Ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems. Sempra Infrastructure’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets. The overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months, while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  25\n\n\nLow Carbon Solutions \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s Low Carbon Solutions business line is focused on commercializing and deploying low carbon solutions in support of meeting the demand for lower carbon and reliable energy supply. The portfolio of resources includes renewable energy infrastructure, a natural gas-fired power plant, as well as potential hydrogen fuel production and advanced carbon capture, usage and storage technologies that are under development. \n\nRenewable Power Generation. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity they generate to their customers, which are generally load-serving entities, as well as industrial and other customers. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities, while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities. At December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had total nameplate capacity of 1,044 MW related to its operating wind and solar power generation facilities. Generation from Sempra Infrastructure’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight. Additionally, some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the Mexican government and related litigation, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\n\nRENEWABLE POWER GENERATION\n\nLocationContract expiration dateNameplate capacity (MW)\n\nWind power generation facilities:\n\nESJ – first phaseTecate, Baja California2035155 \n\nESJ – second phaseTecate, Baja California2042108 \n\nVentikaNuevo León, Mexico2036252 \n\nSolar power generation facilities:\n\nBorder SolarCiudad Juarez, Chihuahua2032 and 2037150 \n\nDon Diego SolarBenjamin Hill, Sonora2034 and 2037125 \n\nPima SolarCaborca, Sonora2038110 \n\nRumorosa SolarTecate, Baja California203444 \n\nTepezalá SolarAguascalientes2034100 \n\nTotal1,044 \n\nNatural Gas-Fired Generation. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TdM power plant in the vicinity of Mexicali, Baja California, adjacent to the Mexico-U.S. border. TdM is a 625 MW natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant that is connected to our Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system, which enables it to receive regasified LNG from the ECA Regas Facility as well as continental gas supplied from the U.S. on the North Baja pipeline. TdM generates revenue from selling electricity and resource adequacy to the California ISO for delivery to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities.\n\nLow Carbon Solutions Projects. Sempra Infrastructure is constructing the Cimarrón Wind project, an approximately 320 MW wind generation facility in Baja California, Mexico. Sempra Infrastructure has a 20-year PPA with Silicon Valley Power for the long-term supply of renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, California. Cimarrón Wind will utilize Sempra Infrastructure’s existing cross-border high voltage transmission line to interconnect and deliver clean energy to the East County substation in San Diego County. We expect the Cimarrón Wind project to begin generating energy in late 2025 and commence commercial operations in the first half of 2026. \n\nSempra Infrastructure is also evaluating the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration development opportunity, which is a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.\n\nDemand and Competition. Sempra Infrastructure competes with Mexican and foreign companies for new energy infrastructure projects in Mexico. Some of its competitors (including public or state-operated companies and their affiliates) may have better access to capital or greater financial and other resources or advantages, which could give them a competitive advantage for such projects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  26\n\n\nSempra Infrastructure sells power from its ESJ wind power facility into California, where renewable energy demand is affected by U.S. state mandates requiring a portion of energy to come from renewable sources. These mandates are part of California’s RPS Program. The first and second phases of ESJ, which are in operation, were certified by the CEC under the RPS Program. Certification by the CEC means that the energy produced by a facility can be counted towards the RPS Program requirements, which in turn affects the demand from California load serving entities for energy from that facility. In January 2025, the CEC approved Cimarrón Wind’s application for precertification under the RPS Program.\n\nTdM competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the California electricity market. Sempra Infrastructure manages commodity price risk at TdM by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy, energy spreads hedging, ancillary services, and short-term to medium-term capacity sales.\n\nREGULATION\n\nWe discuss the material effects of compliance with all government regulations, including environmental regulations, on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nUtility Regulation\n\nCalifornia\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are principally regulated at the state level by the CPUC, CEC and CARB.\n\nThe CPUC:\n\n▪consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms;\n\n▪regulates, among other things, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “U.S. Federal;”\n\n▪has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California;\n\n▪conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters, such as safety, reliability and planning, deregulation, competition and the environment; and\n\n▪regulates the interactions and transactions of SDG&E and SoCalGas with Sempra and other affiliates, including their marketing functions.\n\nThe CPUC also oversees and regulates other energy-related products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations.\n\nThe CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC:\n\n▪determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;\n\n▪sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;\n\n▪promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within California;\n\n▪maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and\n\n▪certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.\n\nThe CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and transportation and distribution costs. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ long-term investment decisions.\n\nWe discuss regulatory oversight by CARB below in “Environmental Matters – Air Quality and GHG Emissions.”\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  27\n\n\nTexas\n\nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities. The PUCT has original jurisdiction over wholesale transmission rates and services and retail rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the PUCT, and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the retail rates, retail services, and ordinances of municipalities. Generally, the Texas PURA prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility (as defined by PURA) that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority (i.e., the PUCT or the municipality with original jurisdiction). \n\nAt the state level, PURA requires utility owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide open-access wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system. The PUCT has adopted rules implementing the state open-access requirements for all utilities that are subject to the PUCT’s jurisdiction over electric transmission services, including Oncor. \n\nU.S. Federal\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also regulated at the federal level by the FERC, the EPA, the DOE and the DOT, and for SDG&E the NRC.\n\nThe FERC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC also regulates SDG&E’s transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return and rates of depreciation on transmission investment, electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts. The U.S. Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service. The California IOUs’ electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the California ISO. As member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which we discuss below. To a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets, Oncor’s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the FERC.\n\nThe NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the U.S., including SONGS, in which SDG&E owns a 20% interest, and which permanently ceased operations in 2013. The NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of these facilities’ safety, radiological and environmental aspects. We provide further discussion of SONGS matters, including the closure and decommissioning of the facility, in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe EPA implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment, including federal laws on air quality, water quality, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, and hazardous waste disposal and remediation. The EPA also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their regulations. As a result, SDG&E, SoCalGas, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations.\n\nThe DOT, through PHMSA, has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures, including procedures intended to manage cybersecurity risks, applicable to SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, as well as natural gas storage facilities. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. \n\nERCOT Market\n\nAs member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which represents approximately 90% of the electricity consumption in Texas. ERCOT is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in Texas and the ISO of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems. ERCOT is subject to oversight by the PUCT and the Texas Legislature. ERCOT is responsible for ensuring reliability, adequacy and security of the electric systems, as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants, in the ERCOT region. ERCOT’s membership consists of corporate and associate members, including electric cooperatives, municipal power agencies, independent generators, independent power marketers, transmission service providers, distribution service providers, independent retail electric providers and consumers. \n\nThe PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’ main interconnected electric transmission grid. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities, along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in Texas, assist the ERCOT ISO in its operations. Each of these Texas utilities has planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and security responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and the load-serving substations it owns, primarily within its certificated distribution service area. Each participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning, designing, constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ERCOT transmission grid. These transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs, support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  28\n\n\nOncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the Texas Reliability Entity, Inc., an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ERCOT region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, including critical infrastructure protection, and ERCOT protocols.\n\nOther U.S. State and Local Territories Regulation\n\nSDG&E has electric franchise agreements with the two counties and the 27 cities in its electric service territory, and natural gas franchise agreements with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory. These franchise agreements allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity or natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2028 to 2041. SDG&E has electric and natural gas franchises for the City of San Diego. These franchise agreements, which went into effect in July 2021, provide SDG&E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for the next 20 years, consisting of 10-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional 10 years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewal. These franchise agreements have been challenged in two lawsuits that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSoCalGas has natural gas franchise agreements with the 12 counties and the 232 cities in its service territory. These franchise agreements allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2026 to 2069. In December 2024, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors granted SoCalGas a new, 20-year gas pipeline franchise. The franchise consists of an initial 10-year term beginning on January 9, 2025, followed by a 10-year term that Los Angeles County has the option to terminate. Prior to the granting of the new franchise, SoCalGas continued to serve customers in the unincorporated territory of Los Angeles County in accordance with its prior franchise.\n\nOther U.S. Regulation\n\nThe FERC regulates certain Sempra Infrastructure assets pursuant to the U.S. Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG facilities. \n\nThe FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at Sempra Infrastructure are market-based for wholesale electricity sales, cost-based for the transportation of natural gas, and market-based for the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s investment in Cameron LNG JV is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. Under these regulations, the DOE acts on LNG export applications to non-FTA countries after completing a public interest review that includes several criteria, including economic and environmental review of the proposed export. Sempra Infrastructure’s other potential natural gas liquefaction projects would, if completed, be subject to similar regulations.\n\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and businesses in which Sempra Infrastructure invests are subject to the DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT’s national regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. PHMSA also regulates the safety of onshore LNG facilities.\n\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nForeign Regulation\n\nOperations and projects in our Sempra Infrastructure segment are subject to regulation by the CRE, ASEA, SENER, the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Mexico (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), and other labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico. New energy infrastructure projects may also require a favorable opinion from Mexico’s Competition Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica) in order to be constructed and operated. Recent Mexican Constitutional reforms have proposed to transfer significant powers from the CRE to SENER; implementing legislation on these reforms is expected to be forthcoming.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  29\n\n\nLicenses and Permits\n\nOur utilities in California and Texas obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for, as applicable, the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities, some of which may require periodic renewal. \n\nSempra Infrastructure obtains numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for its electric and natural gas distribution, generation and transmission systems from the local governments where these services are provided. The permits for generation, transportation, storage and distribution operations at Sempra Infrastructure are generally for 30-year terms, with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions. Sempra Infrastructure obtains licenses and permits for the construction, operation and expansion of LNG facilities and for the import and export of LNG and natural gas. Sempra Infrastructure also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products. Sempra Infrastructure obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market. Most of the permits and licenses associated with Sempra Infrastructure’s construction and operations are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or expected useful life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years.\n\nRATEMAKING MECHANISMS\n\nSempra California\n\nGeneral Rate Case Proceedings\n\nA CPUC GRC proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. The proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements and provides for attrition, or annual increases in revenue requirements, for each year following the test year. Both the test year revenue requirements and attrition authorize how much SDG&E and SoCalGas can collect from their customers in base rates.\n\nWe discuss the GRC in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCost of Capital Proceedings \n\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and return on rate base, which is a weighted average of the authorized returns on debt, preferred equity and common equity (referred to as ROE), weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure. The authorized return on rate base approved by the CPUC is the rate that SDG&E and SoCalGas use to establish customer rates to finance investments in CPUC-regulated electric distribution and generation, natural gas distribution, transmission and storage assets, as well as general PP&E and information technology systems investments to support operations.\n\nThe CPUC established the CCM to apply in the interim years between required cost of capital applications and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (the CCM benchmark) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). The index applicable to SDG&E and SoCalGas is based on each utility’s credit rating. The CCM benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the CCM is triggered in each measurement period, which occurs if the change in the applicable Moody’s utility bond index relative to the CCM benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus 1.00% for the measurement period. The CCM, if triggered, would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized ROE upward or downward by 20% of the difference between the CCM benchmark rate and the applicable Moody’s utility bond index during the measurement period, subject to regulatory approval. Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole.\n\nWe discuss the cost of capital and CCM in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  30\n\n\nTransmission Rate Cases \n\nSDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. The proceeding establishes a ROE and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using (i) a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments, and (ii) a true-up period, similar to balancing account treatment, that is designed to provide earnings equal to SDG&E’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment. SDG&E makes annual filings with the FERC to update rates for the following calendar year. SDG&E may also file for ROE incentives that might apply under FERC rules. SDG&E’s debt-to-equity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year.\n\nWe discuss the latest FERC rate matters in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms \n\nSoCalGas is subject to the GCIM and is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties depending on its performance in relation to specific benchmarks. We discuss the GCIM in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOther Cost-Based Regulatory Recovery\n\nThe CPUC, and the FERC as it relates to SDG&E, authorize SDG&E and SoCalGas to collect, or in the case of CPUC programmatic activities, to apply for additional, revenue requirements beyond base rates from customers for certain operating and capital related costs (depreciation, taxes and return on rate base), including for: \n\n▪costs to purchase natural gas and electricity; \n\n▪costs associated with administering public purpose, demand response, environmental compliance, and customer energy efficiency programs; \n\n▪other programmatic activities, such as gas distribution, gas transmission, gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation; and\n\n▪costs associated with third party liability insurance premiums.\n\nAuthorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered. To the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs, the differences are generally recovered or refunded in a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism. In general, the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met when the costs are incurred. Because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues. The CPUC and the FERC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program’s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from customers.\n\nSempra Texas Utilities\n\nRates and Cost Recovery \n\nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are each regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities, and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide assurance as to achievement of earnings levels or recovery of actual costs. Instead, their rates are based on an analysis of each utility’s costs and capital structure in a designated test year, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of the Texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred and therefore fully recoverable. The approved levels and timing of recovery could differ significantly from requested levels and timing. There can also be no assurance that the PUCT will approve any other items requested in any rate proceeding or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the Texas utilities’ actual post-test year costs and/or the full return on invested capital allowed by the PUCT, particularly during periods of increased capital spending, high inflation or increases in interest rates resulting in increased costs relative to the utility’s most recent base rate review.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  31\n\n\nPUCT rules provide that a transmission and distribution utility must file a comprehensive base rate review within four years of the last order in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding unless an extension is otherwise approved by the PUCT. However, the PUCT or any city retaining original jurisdiction over rates may direct the utility to file a base rate review, or the utility may voluntarily file a base rate review, any time prior to that deadline. Pursuant to these rules, Oncor’s next base rate review must be filed no later than June 2027. \n\nWe discuss Oncor’s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\n\nSharyland Utilities’ 2020 rate case became effective in July 2021 and remains effective until the next rate case is finalized, which we expect could be in late 2025.\n\nIn addition, PUCT rules allow Texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to recover distribution-related investments placed into service between base rate review proceedings. PUCT rules also allow the Texas utilities to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital. These applications for interim rate adjustments between base rate reviews, known as “capital tracker” provisions, are intended to encourage transmission and distribution investments in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by helping to shorten the time period between a utility’s investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and its ability to start recovering and earning a return on such investments. However, all investments included in a capital tracker are ultimately subject to prudence review by the PUCT in the next base rate review, after such assets are put into service.\n\nCapital Structure and Return on Equity \n\nIn April 2023, the PUCT issued a final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review that set Oncor’s authorized ROE at 9.7%, a decrease from its previously authorized ROE of 9.8%, and maintained Oncor’s authorized regulatory capital structure at 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity.\n\nSharyland Utilities’ PUCT-authorized ROE is 9.38% and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 60% debt to 40% equity. \n\nSempra Infrastructure\n\nEcogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in Mexican pesos. The price Ecogas pays to purchase natural gas, which is based on international price indices, is passed through directly to its customers. The service and distribution fees charged by Ecogas are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to end-users. Ecogas’ rate case for 2021 through 2025 was approved by the CRE in December 2023. The tariffs operate under a return-on-asset-base model. In the annual tariff adjustment, rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates, and inflation indexing includes separate U.S. and Mexican cost components so that U.S. costs can be included in the final distribution rates.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nWe discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.\n\nHazardous Substances\n\nThe CPUC’s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. For sites that are covered by this mechanism, SDG&E and SoCalGas are permitted to recover in rates 90% of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70% of related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, SDG&E and SoCalGas can retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.\n\nWe record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  32\n\n\nAir Quality and GHG Emissions\n\nThe natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and GHG emissions standards. AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing GHG emissions. The law requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emissions reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office. Sempra Infrastructure is also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB.\n\nCalifornia requires certain electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the RPS Program. SB 100 (enacted in 2018) and SB 1020 (enacted in 2022) require each California electric utility, including SDG&E, to procure at least 50% of its annual retail electricity delivered from renewable energy or zero-carbon sources by 2026, 60% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 95% by 2040. SDG&E expects to be in compliance with these RPS program requirements. State law also requires California’s retail electricity supply to be met with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon sources by 2045 without increasing carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid or allowing resource shuffling, and instructs the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies to incorporate this requirement into all relevant planning. In addition, AB 1279 (enacted in 2022) requires the State of California to achieve net-zero GHG emissions no later than 2045, and to achieve and maintain net negative GHG emissions thereafter. AB 1279 also directs CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect major sectors of California’s economy, including energy utilities, transportation, agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Other state climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal include executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles, including SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ light-duty fleet vehicles, to be zero-emission by 2035. \n\nCalifornia has implemented a biomethane procurement program, whereby IOUs providing gas service in California will procure a portion of the natural gas they deliver from biomethane. The rules governing this program are administered by the CPUC under SB 1440, whereby the proportion of biomethane procured will be phased-in with a state-wide, short-term target in 2025 of 17.6 Bcf per year and a medium-term target in 2030 of 72.8 Bcf per year. SDG&E and SoCalGas are allocated 6.77% and 49.26%, respectively, of the 2025 target, and 7.60% and 52.02%, respectively, of the 2030 target. The CPUC is currently evaluating public comments to inform their review of the pending Renewable Gas Procurement Plans filed by the California gas IOUs and work towards identifying potential enhancements to the biomethane procurement program structure, including areas such as increasing market competition, reducing potential barriers for biomethane producers, streamlining procurement requirements, and improving alignment with regulatory goals.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas generally recover the costs to comply with these standards in rates. We discuss GHG emissions standards, allowances and obligations and RECs in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district’s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nSempra continues to decarbonize its operations with an aim to have net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 and an interim target of 50% scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reductions by 2035 (this interim target applies to Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure’s Mexico (non-LNG) operations and is relative to a 2019 baseline). While the company no longer has a specific goal to achieve net-zero scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050, Sempra continues to advocate for programs and initiatives that support regulatory, consumer and market demand for lower- and zero-carbon energy. Additionally, although SDG&E and SoCalGas continue to support California’s goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, their respective abilities to achieve their net-zero aspirations, as well as Sempra’s ability to achieve its 2035 and 2050 net-zero aspirations, will depend on the development, commercialization and regulatory acceptance of affordable lower carbon generation resources and cleaner fuels, among other factors. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our net-zero and other climate aims, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\n\nWith respect to our net-zero aims, even in a state of “net-zero,” GHG emissions may still be generated, but with innovation and continued development of new technology and solutions, it could allow an equal amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent to be removed from the atmosphere, resulting in a zero increase in overall net emissions. In addition, for purposes of these net-zero aims, we expect that achievement of net-zero GHG emissions will be determined based on operations in 2050 and GHG emissions will be calculated according to widely accepted emissions reporting guidelines or mandates at that time, and our net-zero aim does not include Oncor, which sets its own goals due to certain ring-fencing measures that limit Sempra’s ability to direct the management or activities of Oncor.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  33\n\n\nOTHER MATTERS\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nNameAge(1)\n\nPositions held over last five yearsTime in position\n\nSempra:\n\nJeffrey W.

Schwecke, not currently an executive officer, will assume the role as Chief Operating Officer effective March 1, 2025. \n\nHuman Capital\n\nOur ability to advance our mission to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company largely depends on the safety, engagement, and responsible actions of our employees. \n\nSafety is foundational at Sempra and its subsidiaries. We strive to foster a strong safety culture and reinforce this culture through various policies, programs and systems designed to mitigate the occurrence and extent of safety incidents, including, training programs, benchmarking, review and analysis of safety trends, internal compliance assessments and audits, and sharing lessons learned from safety incidents and near misses across our businesses. Our businesses also engage in safety-related scenario planning and simulation, develop and implement operational contingency plans, and review safety plans and procedures with work crews regularly. We also participate in emergency planning and preparedness in the communities we serve and train critical employees in emergency management and response each year. The SST Committee assists the Sempra board of directors in overseeing the company’s oversight programs and performance related to safety, and our executives’ annual incentive compensation is based in part on safety metrics established by the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the board.\n\nIn addition, we strive to create a high-performing, inclusive and supportive workplace where employees of all backgrounds and experiences feel valued and respected. We invest in recruiting, developing and retaining high-performing employees who represent the communities we serve, and we provide a range of programs for employees, including internal and external mentoring and leadership training and workshops, employee resource groups, and a benefits package including wellness benefits and a tuition reimbursement program. We also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities as well as regular executive communications to employees on topics of interest. In addition, we offer a variety of employee community service opportunities, and at our U.S. operations, we support employees’ personal volunteering and charitable giving through the charitable matching program of Sempra Foundation, which was founded and is solely funded by Sempra. Employees participate in annual ethics and compliance training, which includes a review of Sempra’s Code of Business Conduct as well as information about resources such as Sempra’s ethics and compliance helpline. We measure culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including pulse surveys, suggestion boxes and a biannual engagement survey administered by a third party.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  36\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of employees for each of the Registrants at December 31, 2024, as well as the number of those employees represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment. We did not experience any major work stoppages in 2024, and we maintain constructive relations with our labor unions.\n\nNUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\n\nNumber of employeesNumber of employees covered under collective bargaining agreementsNumber of employees covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year\n\nSempra(1)\n\n16,773 6,335 4,895 \n\nSDG&E4,779 1,440 — \n\nSoCalGas8,829 4,850 4,850 \n\n(1)    Excludes employees of equity method investees.\n\nLabor Relations\n\nField, technical and most clerical employees at SoCalGas are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America or the International Chemical Workers Union Council. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages, hours, working conditions, and medical and other benefit plans was due to expire on September 30, 2024, but was extended by mutual agreement through February 7, 2025, while SoCalGas and the unions continued negotiations. Two ratification votes in late 2024 were not successful. SoCalGas is currently operating under the terms of the expired agreement while the parties continue to negotiate revised terms and seek a positive ratification vote from union members. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions, though we do not anticipate that such labor disruptions would have a material impact on service.\n\nCOMPANY WEBSITES\n\nThe Registrants’ website addresses are:\n\n▪Sempra – www.sempra.com\n\n▪SDG&E – www.sdge.com\n\n▪SoCalGas – www.socalgas.com\n\nWe make available free of charge on the Sempra website, and for SDG&E and SoCalGas, via a hyperlink on their websites, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe references to our websites in this report are not active hyperlinks and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the websites of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas or any other website referenced herein is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this report or any other document that we file with or furnish to the SEC.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  37\n\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nWhen evaluating our company and its consolidated entities and any investment in our or their securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC (including those filed subsequent to this report). We also may be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of these risks occurs, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, and the trading prices of our securities and those of our consolidated entities could decline. These risk factors are not prioritized in order of importance or materiality, and they should be read together with the other information in this report, including in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A.”\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA \n\nOperational and Structural Risks\n\nSempra’s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations largely depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments.\n\nWe are a holding company and substantially all the assets that produce our earnings are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control, including equity method investments. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on distributions from our subsidiaries and equity method investments, which in turn depend on their ability to execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, dividend payments to third-party owners (if any) and debt and other obligations. In addition, entities accounted for as equity method investments, which we do not control, and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from doing so by legislation, regulation or contractual restrictions, in times of financial distress or in other circumstances. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra’s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of each entity’s trade and other creditors. When Sempra is a creditor of any such entity, its rights as a creditor are effectively subordinated to any security interest in the entity’s assets and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by Sempra. In addition, Sempra may elect to make capital contributions to its subsidiaries, which are not required to be repaid and are structurally subordinated to claims by creditors of the applicable subsidiary.\n\nOur investments in businesses we do not control expose us to risks.\n\nWe have investments in businesses we do not control or manage or in which we share control. In some cases, we engage in arrangements with or for these businesses that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment, including guarantees, indemnities and loans. For businesses we do not control, we are subject to the decisions of others, which may be adverse to our interests. When we share control of a business with other owners, any disagreements among the owners about strategy, financial, operational, transactional or other important matters could hinder the business from moving forward with key initiatives or taking other actions and could negatively affect the relationships among the owners and the efficient functioning of the business. In addition, irrespective of whether we control these businesses, we could be responsible for liabilities or losses related to these businesses or elect to make capital contributions to these businesses. Any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these investments in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur business could be negatively affected by activist shareholders.\n\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to activist shareholder attention. Activist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or assert influence on our board of directors and management. In taking these steps, activist shareholders could seek to acquire our capital stock, in spite of the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other takeover of our company, even when our shareholders might consider such a change of control to be in their best interests. At certain ownership levels, these acquisitions of our common stock could threaten our ability to use some or all of our NOL or tax credit carryforwards if our corporation experiences an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules. Responding to activist \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  38\n\n\nshareholders can be costly and time-consuming and requires time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from our business strategies. \n\nAny actual or perceived instability in our future direction, inability to execute our strategies, or changes in our board of directors or management team arising from activist shareholder campaigns could be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFinancial and Capital Stock-Related Risks\n\nSuccessfully completing our five-year capital expenditures plan is subject to certain risks.\n\nThe execution of our five-year capital expenditures plan may not be completed in accordance with current expectations or produce the desired results. Factors that have historically impacted and could continue to impact the amount, timing and types of capital expenditures we make include the cost and availability of financing; economic and market conditions; regulatory approvals; changes in tax law; business opportunities providing desirable rates of return; forecasts related to safety, reliability and load growth, gas system planning, and transportation electrification; safety and environmental requirements and climate-related policies; and cooperation of third-parties, including customers, partners, suppliers, lenders and others. We discuss these and other relevant factors under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses” below. We aim to finance our five-year capital expenditures plan in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas may be required to make significant expenditures before they can request rate recovery for certain capital projects. There can be no guarantee that such capital expenditures will be recoverable through rates. A significant portion of Oncor’s five-year capital expenditures plan is attributable to expected growth in ERCOT, particularly due to increased demand from large commercial and industrial customers. Changes in projected growth in ERCOT could materially impact Oncor’s capital expenditures and consequently our capital expenditures plan. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that any of Oncor’s capital expenditures will ultimately be recoverable through rates.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSettlement provisions contained in the forward sale agreements we may enter into in connection with our ATM program subject us to certain risks.\n\nIn November 2024, Sempra established an ATM program, which we discuss in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We are permitted to sell shares of our common stock in the ATM program pursuant to forward sale agreements, which grant each counterparty (each a forward purchaser) the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (or, in certain cases, the portion thereof that the forward purchaser determines is affected by the relevant event) and require us to physically settle the forward sale agreement on a date specified by the forward purchaser if, subject to a prior notice requirement:\n\n▪the forward purchaser determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it is unable to hedge in a commercially reasonable manner its exposure to the applicable forward sale agreement because insufficient shares of our common stock are made available for borrowing by securities lenders or that, with respect to borrowing such number of shares of our common stock, it would incur a rate that is greater than the borrow cost specified in the forward sale agreement;\n\n▪we declare any dividend, issue or distribution to existing holders of shares of our common stock that constitutes an extraordinary dividend under the forward sale agreement or is payable in (i) cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (ii) securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price;\n\n▪an event (i) is announced that, if consummated, would result in an extraordinary event (including certain mergers and tender offers, our nationalization, our insolvency and the delisting of the shares of our common stock) or (ii) occurs that would constitute a hedging disruption or change in law;\n\n▪an ownership event (as such term is defined in the forward sale agreement) occurs; or\n\n▪certain other events of default, termination events or other specified events occur, including, among other things, a change in law.\n\nA forward purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate all or a portion of the settlement of its forward sale agreement and to require us to physically settle the relevant shares will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  39\n\n\nIn such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement, which would result in dilution to our EPS and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, Series C preferred stock and any other series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.\n\nThe forward price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor. If the specified daily rate is less than the applicable spread on any day, this will result in a daily reduction of the forward price. In addition, the forward price will be subject to decrease on certain dates specified in the relevant forward sale agreement by the amount per share of quarterly dividends we expect to declare on our common stock during the term of such forward sale agreement.\n\nWe will generally have the right, in lieu of physical settlement of any forward sale agreement, to elect cash or net share settlement in respect of any or all of the shares of our common stock subject to such forward sale agreement. If we elect to cash or net share settle all or any part of any forward sale agreement, we would expect to issue a substantially lower number of shares than if we settled by physical delivery, but would not receive the cash for the shares that would have otherwise been issued if we settled the entire forward sale agreement by physical delivery and, as a result, would not derive the same credit metrics benefits.\n\nIf the price of our common stock at which these purchases are made by such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) exceeds the applicable forward price, we will pay such forward purchaser an amount in cash equal to such difference (if we elect to cash settle) or we will deliver to such forward purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a market value equal to such difference (if we elect to net share settle). Any such difference could be significant and could require us to pay a significant amount of cash or deliver a significant number of shares of our common stock to such forward purchaser.\n\nThe purchase of shares of our common stock by a forward purchaser or its affiliate to unwind the forward purchaser’s hedge position could cause the price of our common stock to increase above the price that would have prevailed in the absence of those purchases (or prevent a decrease in such price), thereby increasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that we would owe such forward purchaser upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement or decreasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that such forward purchaser would owe us upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement.\n\nThe economic interest, voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue. \n\nAt February 19, 2025, we had 651,457,249 shares of our common stock and 900,000 shares of our non-convertible series C preferred stock outstanding. Our businesses have substantial capital needs, and we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity, including in our ATM program, or convertible debt securities in potentially significant amounts depending in part on the prevailing market price of our common stock, which at times experiences substantial volatility. Any future issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\n\nThe dividend requirements of our preferred stock subject us to risks. \n\nAny failure to pay scheduled dividends on our series C preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of the series C preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series C preferred stock. Additionally, the terms of the series C preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods, the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to elect two additional members to our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO ALL SEMPRA BUSINESSES\n\nOperational Risks\n\nOur businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and systems that support this infrastructure.\n\nOur facilities and the systems that interconnect and/or manage them are subject to risks of, among other things, equipment or process failures due to aging or degrading infrastructure or otherwise; human error; loss or outage of a key technology platform or system; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, materials, commodities or labor, which have been and may in the future be \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  40\n\n\nexacerbated by supply chain and gas transportation capacity constraints, tight labor markets, and cost increases due to inflationary pressures, tariffs or otherwise, that may not be recoverable in a timely manner or at all; operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements or governmental interventions or permitting delays; inability to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply or transportation contracts; and performance below expected levels. Our businesses undertake capital investment projects to construct, replace, operate, maintain and upgrade facilities and systems, but such projects may not be completed or effective at managing these risks and involve significant costs that may not be recoverable. We often rely on third parties, including contractors, to perform work related to these projects and other maintenance activities, which may subject us to liability for safety issues and the quality of work performed. Because some of our facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, including customer-side-of-meter facilities, natural gas pipelines and power generation facilities that produce most of the power we distribute, the operation of our facilities could also be materially adversely affected by these or similar risks to such third-party systems, which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us.\n\nAdditional risks associated with our ability to safely and reliably construct, replace, operate, maintain and upgrade facilities and systems, which may be beyond our control, include:\n\n▪failure to meet customer demand for electricity and/or natural gas, including electric or gas outages\n\n▪gas surges into homes or other properties\n\n▪release of hazardous or toxic substances, including gas leaks\n\n▪other incidents impacting the health, safety, or security of employees, contractors, the public or our infrastructure\n\n▪failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events \n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect supply and demand for electricity, natural gas or other forms of energy, cause unplanned outages, damage our assets and/or operations or those of third parties on which our businesses rely, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. In addition, if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and related facilities, which could prevent, limit or delay existing or proposed operations or projects, increase our costs, and result in breaches of permits or contracts and related legal costs, impairments, fines or penalties. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to severe weather, natural disasters, physical attacks and other similar events.\n\nOur facilities and infrastructure may be damaged as a result of physical risks, such as extreme temperatures, storms, droughts and other severe weather; natural disasters, including wildfires (such as the LA Fires), land movement, earthquakes, and solar flares; climate-related conditions, including sea level rise and coastal erosion; accidents, including explosions and excavation damage to pipelines; or acts of terrorism, war, or criminality. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable, explosive and radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as to the surrounding communities for which we could be liable, are substantially greater than the potential risks to a typical business. \n\nSuch incidents could result in operational disruptions, electric or gas outages, property damage, personal injury or death and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects, such as fires; leaks or spills of gases, natural gas odorant or radioactive material; damage to natural resources; or other impacts to affected communities. Any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings and/or increase costs, including maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts associated with claims against us, and regulatory fines, penalties and disallowances. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, which we discuss below under “Risks Related to Sempra California – Operational Risks.” For our regulated utilities, these costs may not be recoverable in rates or recovery may be insufficient or delayed. Insurance coverage for these costs may continue to increase or become prohibitively expensive, be disputed by insurers, or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at adequate levels or in certain geographic locations, and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors. We discuss the risks related to insurance for wildfire liabilities below under “Risks Related to Sempra California — Operational Risks.” Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation and communication channels, which could negatively affect our ability to operate. Moreover, weather-related incidents have become more prevalent, unpredictable and severe due to climate change or other factors. As a result, these incidents could have a greater impact on our businesses than currently anticipated and, for our regulated utilities, rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  41\n\n\nWe face evolving cybersecurity and technology resiliency risks associated with the energy grid, pipelines, storage and other infrastructure as well as the collection of personal, sensitive and confidential information.\n\nOur significant use of and reliance on complex technologies and information systems in our operations, including our increasing deployment of new technologies, such as advanced forms of automation and artificial intelligence, and virtualization of many business activities, and our collection and retention of personal, sensitive and confidential information, represent large-scale opportunities for attacks on, vulnerabilities in or other failures of our information systems, information and energy grid and infrastructure. Our digitalization and grid modernization efforts, including the networking of operational technology assets such as substations, continue to increase the potential vulnerabilities and points of failure in our information systems. We are also at risk of attacks on, vulnerabilities in or other failures of third-party vendors’ and/or regulators’ technologies and systems, depending on the level of access these vendors and agencies have to our information and systems. Viruses, ransomware, malware and other forms of cyber-attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructure are continuously increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, may not be recognized until launched against a target and may further escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, making it impossible for us to eliminate this risk.\n\nOur businesses also face challenges related to data governance, including the need to manage and secure large volumes of electronic data with the aim to meet regulatory requirements and create a foundation for the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. SDG&E and SoCalGas are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer personal information and energy use data) to support state energy initiatives, increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized access of sensitive information. Moreover, all our businesses operating in California (and in other states and countries that have similar laws) are subject to enhanced state privacy laws, which require companies that collect information about California residents to, among other things, disclose their data collection, use and sharing practices; allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and assume liability for unauthorized disclosure of certain highly sensitive personal information.\n\nAlthough we make significant investments in risk management, technology resiliency and information security measures for the protection of our systems and data, these measures could be insufficient or otherwise fail, particularly against attacks involving sophisticated adversaries, including nation-state actors, or outages involving key technology vendors. The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing these measures are significant and expected to increase to address evolving cyber risks. We often rely on third-party vendors to deploy new technologies and maintain and update our systems (including providing security updates), and these third parties may not have adequate risk management, technology resiliency and information security measures with respect to their systems or may fail to timely provide and install software updates. Although we have not experienced a material breach of our information systems or data, we and some of our vendors have been and will likely continue to be subject to breaches of and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems or data or efforts to otherwise disrupt our operations. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with applicable data privacy and security laws or any incidents impacting our or our vendors’ information systems; the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines or our distribution, storage and other infrastructure; or our personal, sensitive and confidential information could result in disruptions to our business operations, regulatory compliance failures, inability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, energy delivery failures, financial and reputational loss, litigation, violations of applicable laws and fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Although Sempra currently maintains cyber liability insurance, this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover the costs associated with a cybersecurity incident, and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates we believe are reasonable.\n\nWe actively seek opportunities in the market through acquisitions, partnerships, JVs and divestitures.\n\nWe diligently analyze the financial viability of each acquisition, divestiture, partnership and JV we pursue. However, our diligence may prove to be insufficient and there could be latent or unforeseen defects. In addition, we may not realize all the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships or JVs for various reasons, including difficulties integrating or separating operations and personnel effectively or in a timely manner, higher or unexpected transaction or operating costs, unknown liabilities, and fluctuations in markets. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to increasing activities and projects intended to advance new energy technologies.\n\nWe regularly participate in research, development and demonstration projects and other activities designed to develop new technologies in the energy space, including those related to hydrogen, liquefaction, energy storage, microgrids, carbon sequestration, and grid modernization. These activities and projects involve significant employee time, as well as substantial capital resources that may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may not be \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  42\n\n\nable to be passed through to customers. We have sought and continue to seek a variety of federal and state funding opportunities, such as government incentives and subsidies under the IRA, for these activities and projects. These efforts can involve significant employee resources and increased compliance requirements and have not always been successful in securing funding on acceptable terms or at all. In some cases, applicable compliance requirements may cost more than the potential funding opportunity, limiting our ability to pursue available funding. In addition, the timing to complete these activities and projects is inherently uncertain and may require significantly more resources than we initially anticipate. Moreover, many of these technologies are in the early stage of development and may not prove economically and technically feasible or be accepted by regulators, and the applicable activities and projects may not be completed. If any of these circumstances occurs, we may not receive an adequate or any return on our investment in these activities and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\nOur businesses depend on recruiting, developing and retaining qualified personnel. Several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, which are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. At December 31, 2024, employees covered under collective bargaining agreements were 38%, 30% and 55%, respectively, of Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ workforce, of which the collective bargaining agreements covering 29%, 0% and 55% of employees, respectively, expire within one year (and in the case of SoCalGas, the collective bargaining agreement expired in February 2025). Any prolonged negotiation or failure to reach an agreement on these labor contracts as they are up for renewal could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions. For SoCalGas, negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement are presently ongoing. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions. Additionally, we have faced a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel in certain specialty operational positions and could experience disruptions from recruiting or retention challenges for personnel in those positions. Any labor disruption, negotiated wage or benefit increases or other challenges, whether due to union activities, employee turnover, labor shortages or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOur businesses depend on the performance of counterparties.\n\nOur businesses depend on the performance of business partners, customers, suppliers, contractors, and other counterparties under contractual and other arrangements to provide, among other things, services, equipment, or commodities. If they fail to perform their obligations in accordance with these arrangements or elect to exercise their early termination rights, we may be unable to meet our obligations and may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or honor our underlying commitments at then-current market prices, which may result in losses or delays or other operational disruptions. Any efforts to enforce the terms of these arrangements through legal or other means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and subject to failure. In addition, many of these arrangements and relationships with counterparties are important for the development, construction and operation of our projects and growth of our businesses. We also may not be able to secure replacement agreements with other counterparties on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all if any of these arrangements terminate. Further, we often face counterparty credit risk with respect to customers, suppliers, and other counterparties and, although we perform credit analyses prior to extending credit or entering into transactions with such counterparties, we may not be able to collect the amounts owed to us, which could be significant and present an increased risk for our long-term supply, sales and capacity contracts. Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on our counterparties and their ability to meet their obligations. Sempra Infrastructure also faces risks related to doing business with PEMEX and the CFE, which are Mexican state-owned enterprises, including their financial solvency and regulation by the Mexican government and the risk that they fail to meet their respective contractual obligations, among others. Any delay or default in payment of our counterparties’ financial obligations could result in our recording of a provision for credit losses on past due receivable balances and lower revenues, as was the case in 2023 and 2024 for a customer at Sempra Infrastructure. The failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn addition, Sempra Infrastructure’s ECA Regas Facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties and also enters into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. Cameron LNG JV has long-term liquefaction and regasification tolling agreements with three counterparties that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, and long-term sale and purchase agreements are in place for the expected capacity at the ECA LNG Phase 1 and PA LNG Phase 1 projects under construction. The long-term nature of these agreements and the small number of customers at each of these facilities exposes us to risks, including increased risk if these counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, increased credit risks, and risks associated with our relationships with these counterparties, including increased impacts of disputes or other similar \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  43\n\n\nissues which we have experienced in the past. Any such issues that arise in the future with respect to our long-term contracts could lead to significant legal and other costs, result in cancelation of certain key contracts or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with long-term customers, suppliers or partners, and could negatively impact the reliability of revenues from the applicable projects and the prospects for any implicated development projects. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s obligations and those of its counterparties, such as its LNG customers, are contractually subject to suspension or termination for force majeure events, which generally are beyond the control of the parties. Force majeure declarations may also have attendant negative consequences, or loss or deferral of revenue arising from non-deliveries of natural gas from suppliers or LNG to customers in certain circumstances. Also, certain force majeure events may impact the contractors constructing Sempra Infrastructure’s projects, which may result in delays or increased costs. Sempra Infrastructure may have limited remedies available for certain failures to perform, including limitations on damages that may prohibit recovery of costs incurred for any breach of an agreement. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure engages in JVs and invests in companies in which other equity partners have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment. Sempra Texas also invests in companies it does not control or manage. We discuss the risks related to such arrangements above under “Risks Related to Sempra – Operational and Structural Risks.”\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOur debt service obligations expose us to risks and could require additional equity securities issuances by Sempra or sales of equity interests in subsidiaries or projects under development.\n\nWe have significant debt service obligations and an ongoing need for significant amounts of additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects by, among other things:\n\n▪making it more difficult and costly to service, pay or refinance debts as they come due, particularly when interest rates increase or economic or industry conditions are otherwise unfavorable\n\n▪limiting flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to business developments or industry changes\n\n▪causing lenders to require materially adverse terms for new debt, such as restrictions on uses of proceeds, limitations on incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing stock, or receiving distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments and the creation of liens \n\nIn January 2025, S&P revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A. Sempra aims to maintain or improve its credit ratings, but we may not be able to do so. To maintain these credit ratings, we may seek to reduce our outstanding indebtedness or our need for additional indebtedness by reducing or postponing discretionary, non-safety related capital expenditures or investments in new businesses. Additionally, we may issue equity securities, including in our ATM program (such as our November 2024 forward sale agreement under the ATM program for the sale of 2,909,274 shares), or sell equity interests in our subsidiaries or development projects. We may not be able to complete any such equity sales on acceptable terms or at all, and any new equity issued by Sempra may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of Sempra’s existing equity holders. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nThe availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be negatively affected by market and economic conditions and other factors.\n\nOur businesses are capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods. In general, we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay or refinance outstanding debt, and we rely on short-term debt to fund a significant portion of day-to-day operations. Sempra has also raised and may continue to seek capital by issuing equity, including in our ATM program, or selling equity interests in our subsidiaries or investments.\n\nLimitations on the availability of credit, increases in interest rates or credit spreads due to inflation or otherwise or other negative effects on the terms of any financing we pursue could cause us to fund operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or fail to raise our targeted amount of funds, which could negatively impact our ability to meet contractual and other commitments, progress development projects, make non-safety related capital expenditures and effectively sustain operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn addition to market and economic conditions, factors that can affect the availability and cost of capital include:\n\n▪adverse changes to laws and regulations, including recent and proposed changes to energy market regulation in Mexico\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  44\n\n\n▪for Sempra and SDG&E, risks related to California wildfires \n\n▪for Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, any deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California\n\n▪credit ratings downgrades, such as S&P’s January 2025 actions that revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A.\n\nCredit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place them on negative outlook.\n\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas, SI Partners and certain of our other businesses whose ratings are based on several factors, including the factors described below and, generally, the ability to generate cash flows; terms and levels of indebtedness, including the credit rating agencies’ treatment of certain types of indebtedness, such as subordinated indebtedness which is given partial equity credit but carries a higher interest rate than comparable senior indebtedness; overall financial strength; specific transactions or events, such as share repurchases and significant litigation; the status of certain capital projects, including our LNG projects; and general economic and industry conditions. These credit ratings could be downgraded or subject to other negative rating actions at any time, such as S&P’s January 2025 actions that revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A. We discuss these credit ratings in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity.”\n\nFor Sempra, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪expansion of natural gas liquefaction projects or other unregulated businesses in a manner inconsistent with its present level of credit quality \n\n▪the PA LNG Phase 1 project experiences higher construction costs\n\n▪Sempra’s consolidated financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund earlier than expected\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at SDG&E, SoCalGas, Oncor and/or SI Partners\n\nFor SDG&E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund earlier than expected\n\n▪a consistent weakening of SDG&E’s financial metrics, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪a deterioration in the regulatory environment, including credit negative outcomes of its pending regulatory proceedings\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra\n\nFor SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪SoCalGas’ financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪SoCalGas experiences increased business risk due to a deterioration in the regulatory environment, including credit negative outcomes of its pending regulatory proceedings or elevated risk concerning its natural gas utility business\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra\n\nFor SI Partners, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪SI Partners’ failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪a deterioration in SI Partners’ business risk profile, including incremental construction risk or adverse changes in the operating environment in Mexico\n\n▪the PA LNG Phase 1 project experiences challenges or delays in construction that have an adverse financial impact on SI Partners\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra, IEnova, Cameron LNG, LLC and/or Port Arthur LNG, LLC\n\nA downgrade of any of our businesses’ credit ratings or ratings outlooks, as well as the reasons for such downgrades, could materially adversely affect the interest rates at which borrowings can be made and debt securities issued and the various fees on our credit facilities. This could make it more costly to borrow money, issue securities and/or raise other types of capital, any of which could reduce our ability to meet our debt obligations and contractual commitments and, in the case of SDG&E and SoCalGas, increase customer rates, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  45\n\n\nWe do not fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices or interest rates, and for positions that are hedged, our hedging mechanisms may not mitigate our risk or reduce our losses as intended.\n\nWe use forward contracts, futures, financial swaps and/or options, among other mechanisms, to hedge a portion of our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity in an effort to reduce our, and for SDG&E and SoCalGas, customers’ financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we have used and may continue to use similar financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates. The extent to which we hedge our positions varies over time. Certain derivative instruments are recorded at fair value through earnings to reflect movements in the price of the derivative, which has recently and could in the future create volatility in our earnings. The effect of such commodity derivative instruments for SDG&E and SoCalGas are passed through to customers in rates without markup. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if any hedging counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations or if our hedging strategies do not work as intended, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRisk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses.\n\nAlthough we have risk management and control systems designed to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or function as expected. In addition, daily VaR and loss limits, which are primarily based on historic price movements and which we discuss in “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” may not protect us from losses if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices. As a result of these and other factors, our risk management procedures and systems may not prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could result in a material charge to earnings.\n\nWe test long-lived assets, including equity method investments, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may affect the recoverability or the estimated useful lives of the assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances necessitate a valuation. We could experience such an event or change in circumstances from, among other things, (i) an inability to operate our existing facilities, (ii) an inability to collect from customers, (iii) changes to laws or regulations or other circumstances affecting the energy sector or our assets in Mexico, (iv) adverse rulings in lawsuits, binding arbitrations, regulatory proceedings, audits and other proceedings materially impacting our businesses, including our equity method investments such as Oncor Holdings and Cameron LNG JV, and (v) more generally any loss of permits or approvals that requires us to adjust or cease certain operations and any failure to complete or receive an adequate return on our investments in capital projects. A material charge to earnings from an impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require unplanned contributions to pension and PBOP plans.\n\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension and PBOP plans to eligible employees and retirees. The cost of providing these benefits is affected by many factors, including the market value of plan assets and the other factors described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity.” A decline in the market value of plan assets or an adverse change in any of these other factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations for these plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  46\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe face risks related to failures and delays in obtaining and maintaining permits, licenses, franchises and other approvals required by our businesses.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation, and our businesses require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchises, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These approvals may not be granted in a timely manner (including due to potential staffing issues at U.S. regulatory agencies) or at all or may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended for a variety of reasons, including due to legal or regulatory changes or political considerations. The City of San Diego is studying the feasibility of municipalization as a potential alternative to SDG&E’s existing electric franchise agreement, and various aspects of SDG&E’s natural gas and electric franchise agreements have also been challenged in two lawsuits that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At Sempra Infrastructure, amendments to Mexico’s Constitution and to Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law have the potential to increase government control and participation in the energy sector and may require the CRE to revoke Sempra Infrastructure’s self-supply permits deemed improperly obtained under a legal standard that is ambiguous and not well defined under the law. Obtaining or maintaining required approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on our operations. Further, noncompliance by us or certain of our customers with the terms of these approvals could result in their modification, suspension or rescission and subject us to lost revenue, fines and penalties. If any of these approvals are suspended, rescinded or otherwise terminated or modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise impracticable, we may be required to adjust or temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations, sell the associated assets or remove them from service and/or construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, in which case we may lose some of our rate base or revenue-generating assets, our development projects may be negatively affected and we may incur impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFrom time to time, we invest funds in projects prior to receiving all regulatory approvals. We may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in such projects if: \n\n▪there is a delay in obtaining these approvals \n\n▪any approval is conditioned on changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations \n\n▪we fail to obtain or maintain these approvals or comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations \n\n▪we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any approval or rights to the applicable property or assets \n\n▪management decides not to proceed with a project \n\nOur inability to recover funds invested in these projects could materially increase our costs, result in material impairments, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to environmental and climate change regulation and the costs of the energy transition. \n\nThe impacts from the mitigation of climate change and related regulations may increase the costs we incur to procure and transmit energy and provide other services. The changes in costs and preferences for lower carbon and renewable energy sources may impact the demand for, consumption of, and type of energy we transmit and distribute. \n\nEnvironmental and Climate Change Regulation\n\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, regional, local and foreign statutes, orders, rules and regulations relating to climate change and environmental protection. To comply with these requirements, we must expend significant capital and employee resources on environmental monitoring, surveillance and other measures to track performance; acquisition and installation of pollution control equipment; mitigation efforts; and emissions fees, which could increase as a result of various factors we may not control, including changing laws and regulations, increased readiness and enforcement activities, delays in the renewal and issuance of permits, and changes to the mix of energy we transmit and distribute. In addition, we are generally responsible for hazardous substances and other contamination on and the conditions of our projects and properties, regardless of when these conditions arose and whether they are known or unknown. We have been and may in the future be required to pay environmental remediation costs at former facilities and off-site waste disposal sites where any of our businesses is identified as a PRP under federal, state and local environmental laws. For our regulated utilities, some or all of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and/or curtailment of our operations. Moreover, increasing international, national, regional, state and local environmental concerns and related changes to applicable legal and regulatory frameworks, such as requirements for increased monitoring and surveillance, disclosures on environmental performance, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  47\n\n\npractices, emissions fees, taxes, penalties or other obligations or restrictions, may have material negative effects on our operations, costs, corporate planning, and the scope and economics of proposed infrastructure projects or other capital expenditures. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn particular, legislation and regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change are proliferating, as we discuss in “Part I — Item 1. Environmental Matters.” California’s goals are facing cost pressures and may experience delays or other challenges that could cause the state to modify its laws and rules, resulting in significant uncertainty. These or other similar laws and rules may materially restrict our operations, negatively impact demand for our services and/or the energy we transmit and distribute, limit development opportunities, force costly or otherwise burdensome changes to our operations, negatively impact customer affordability, or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC’s final rules on climate-related disclosures and California laws requiring expansive disclosures on GHG emissions and other environmental measures, targets and claims could subject us to liability for these disclosures as well as significant compliance costs and could have other consequences that may be difficult to predict, including negative sentiment from current and potential investors, regulators or other groups. These new disclosure requirements may use different reporting frameworks and methodologies, such as reporting boundaries, which may further increase compliance costs and the risk of compliance failures and may create confusion for stakeholders. Moreover, these disclosure requirements could increase the risk that we become subject to climate change lawsuits. Defense costs associated with such litigation could be significant, and any adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures or payment of substantial penalties or damages. Although these new disclosure requirements are subject to challenges in pending lawsuits and may change as a result of further agency action, any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOther Energy Transition Risks\n\nThe energy transition in California and elsewhere, including decarbonization goals, has introduced uncertainty in long-term investor support, leading some to reduce investment in or divest from our sector. Maintaining investor confidence and attracting capital at a competitive cost will depend, in part, on demonstrating our ability to address material business risks related to climate and our efforts to help achieve the goals of our consumers and the markets and jurisdictions where we operate. In an effort to maintain a sustainable and durable business risk profile and continue to focus on value creation, Sempra has evaluated and updated its climate aspirations to reflect the changing policy, regulatory, commercial and technological landscape, including stakeholders’ evolving focus on reliability, resiliency and affordability and the pace and impact of climate and other public policies. Following this evaluation, Sempra now aims to have net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050, with an interim target of 50% scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reductions by 2035 (this interim target applies to Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure’s Mexico (non-LNG) operations and is relative to a 2019 baseline). While the company no longer has a specific goal to achieve net-zero scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050, the capabilities we are developing through our energy transition action plan could also support the reduction of scope 3 GHG emissions and help meet regulatory, consumer and market demand for lower- and zero-carbon energy. Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ abilities to advance their respective net-zero and other climate objectives will depend on many factors, some of which we do not control, including supportive federal and state energy laws, policies, incentives, tax credits and regulatory decisions; cost and affordability considerations; development, commercialization and regulatory acceptance of alternative and lower-carbon energy sources, including cleaner fuels; successful research and development efforts focused on lower carbon technologies that are economically and technically feasible; cooperation from our partners, financing sources and commercial counterparties; customer participation in conservation and energy efficiency programs; our ability to execute our planned investments in our infrastructure; and consumers’ decisions and preferences. In addition, forecasting to 2035, 2045 and 2050 is inherently speculative without knowing the trajectory of the energy transition. As a result, although we are dedicated to progress on our climate aims and are continuing to develop capabilities designed to reduce GHG emissions from our own operations as well as to support consumers’ and markets’ own climate goals, we may not be successful in achieving these objectives.\n\nWe will need to continue to expend capital and employee resources to develop and deploy new technologies and modernize grid systems to meet the demand for lower carbon and reliable energy in California and elsewhere and achieve our climate aspirations and those mandated by applicable authorities, which may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may not be able to be passed through to customers. Even if such costs are recoverable, these costs, coupled with necessary safety and reliability investments, may negatively impact the affordability of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and, for our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may cause costs to increase to levels that reduce customer demand and growth. SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as any of our other businesses affected by GHG emissions reduction and mitigation and renewable energy mandates, may also be subject to fines and penalties if mandated goals are not met, and all our businesses could suffer difficulties attracting investors and business partners, reputational harm and other negative effects if we do not meet or if \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  48\n\n\nwe further modify our GHG emissions reduction aims or there are negative views about our environmental disclosures or practices generally. \n\nWe develop our capital expenditure plans based on forecasts as well as regulatory and compliance requirements, including those related to safety, reliability and load growth, gas system planning, and transportation electrification, which generally assume that California will continue to pursue consistent environmental and climate-related policies. If the federal government withdraws its support for grid and infrastructure modernization or prohibits California from pursuing its environmental and climate-related policies, or if California changes its policies, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be unable to meet their respective aims.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe are subject to complex tax and accounting requirements that expose us to risks.\n\nWe are subject to complex tax and accounting requirements. These requirements may undergo changes at the federal, state, local and foreign levels, including in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements, including changes to them or how they are implemented, interpreted or enforced, could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect how we conduct our business. New tax legislation, regulations or interpretations or changes in tax policies in the U.S., Mexico or other countries in which we operate or do business could negatively affect our tax expense and/or tax balances and our businesses generally. Any failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe may be negatively impacted by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved.\n\nOur businesses are involved in a number of lawsuits, appeals, binding arbitrations, regulatory investigations and other proceedings. We discuss material pending proceedings in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our businesses also may become involved in new proceedings that we do not consider material, such as the approximately 28,000 proofs of claim that have been filed on behalf of persons who assert the right to file lawsuits in the future based on alleged exposure to asbestos in power plants designed and/or built by certain predecessor entities we acquired in connection with our acquisition of our majority interest in Oncor. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial money, time and employee and management focus on lawsuits and other proceedings. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits and other proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing, costs and ranges of costs or outcome of these matters, and changes or disruptions to the judicial system, such as the nationwide strike by the Mexican judiciary in 2024 in response to recent Mexican Constitutional reforms that require all judges to be elected rather than appointed, could result in delays, increased costs, or unfavorable outcomes. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in response to personal injury, product liability, property damage, nuisance, and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred have and may continue to differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, from insurance or in customer rates. Any of the foregoing could cause reputational damage and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA CALIFORNIA\n\nOperational Risks\n\nWildfires in California pose risks to Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas.\n\nMore and Increasingly Severe Wildfires\n\nIn recent years, California has experienced some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned and/or structures destroyed) in its history. Frequent and severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, low humidity, strong winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity, prevalence and difficulty of prevention and containment of wildfires in California, including in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could exacerbate these conditions. Certain of California’s local land use policies and forestry management practices have allowed for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses related to fires for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable. The LA Fires damaged some of SoCalGas’ natural gas infrastructure and significant third-party property and resulted in service disruptions in some of its service territory. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  49\n\n\nFuture wildfires in SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ service territories could compromise SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ electric and natural gas infrastructure and result in further service disruptions. Any such wildfires in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ territories (or outside of SDG&E’s territory in the event the Wildfire Fund is materially diminished) could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which we discuss further in this risk factor below and above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks.” \n\nThe Wildfire Legislation \n\nIn July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law, which we discuss in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Wildfire Legislation’s legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently, we may not be eligible for the Wildfire Legislation’s cap on wildfire-related liability if SDG&E fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the OEIS or meet other requirements, and/or the Wildfire Fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by SDG&E or other participating IOUs as a result of fires in their respective service territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s and SDG&E’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. PG&E is seeking reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie Fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021. In addition, fires of the size and scope of the recent LA Fires, if found to have been caused by a participating IOU, could have a material adverse effect on the Wildfire Fund. In the case of the LA fires, the causes of these fires have not been determined and therefore these fires may not impact the Wildfire Fund. \n\nIn addition, the Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including business interruption losses, interest and attorneys’ fees, even if the utility is not found negligent. In the past, the CPUC has denied recovery of incurred costs associated with wildfire claims despite the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which was historically based on the ability of a utility to pass such costs through to rate payers. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, such as negligence, under which additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. We are unable to predict the impact of the Wildfire Legislation on SDG&E’s ability to recover costs and expenses if SDG&E’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation.\n\nCost Recovery Through Insurance or Rates\n\nAs a result of California’s doctrine of inverse condemnation, substantial losses recorded by insurance companies, and increased wildfire risk, obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires potentially associated with SDG&E’s equipment (or, to a lesser extent, SoCalGas) has become increasingly difficult and costly. If these conditions continue or worsen, including as a result of the LA Fires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be denied recovery of insurance cost increases through the regulatory process. In addition, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur, or it may not be available to meet the $1.0 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. Wildfire insurance may also become prohibitively expensive or unavailable for homeowners and businesses in SDG&E’s service territory, potentially increasing SDG&E’s financial exposure if a wildfire is found to be caused by SDG&E’s equipment. We are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the amount of any uninsured losses. A loss that is not fully insured, is not sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect Sempra’s and one or both of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWildfire Mitigation Efforts\n\nAlthough we expend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfire-related losses, and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. SDG&E is required by California law to submit wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the OEIS and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner or SDG&E is determined to not have substantially complied with its approved plans, including the risk of fines or penalties for noncompliance. One of our wildfire mitigation strategies is to de-energize certain circuits for safety when there is elevated weather-related wildfire ignition risk. These “public safety power shutoffs” have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and lawmakers, which could increase the risk of liability for damages associated with these events if SDG&E is found not to have acted within applicable guidelines and regulations. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, stakeholder scrutiny, ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  50\n\n\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of renewable energy sources and energy storage, technological advancements, evolving procurement service standards, and political and regulatory developments. \n\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of solar and wind generation, including DER, energy storage and energy efficiency and demand management technologies, and California’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes. This growth will require further modernization of the electric grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, attaining California’s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in transmission and distribution grid modernization, renewable energy integration projects, energy efficiency programs, operational and data management systems, and electric vehicle and energy storage infrastructure, which may increase exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. The growth of third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies also may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. Certain FERC transmission development projects are open to competition, allowing independent developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. The CPUC is conducting various proceedings regarding DER, including the evaluation of special programs and pilot projects; changes to the planning and operation of the electric grid to prepare for higher penetration of DER; future grid modernization investments; the deferral of traditional grid investments by DER; and the role of the electric grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California’s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nMost of SDG&E’s customers receive electric procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. CCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program, as is the case with the City of San Diego and certain other jurisdictions in SDG&E’s service territory, and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. As a result of customers electing CCA and DA services, SDG&E’s historical energy procurement commitments for future deliveries exceed the needs of its remaining bundled customers. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether customers’ energy is procured by SDG&E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The framework is intended to more equitably allocate SDG&E’s procurement cost obligations among customers served by SDG&E and customers now served by CCA and DA. If the framework or other mechanisms designed to achieve ratepayer indifference do not perform as intended, if the law changes, or if the law is not interpreted or enforced as expected, SDG&E’s remaining bundled customers could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA and DA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG&E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nNatural gas continues to be the subject of political and public debate, including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source. \n\nCertain California legislators, regulators and other stakeholders have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source through increased use of renewable electricity and electrification. Reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain local, state and federal agencies, resulting in passed or proposed legislation, regulation, policies and ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use of natural gas in new buildings, appliances and other applications. These actions could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time, and the combination of reduced load and increasing costs to maintain the gas system could negatively impact affordability for remaining natural gas customers.\n\nIn February 2017, the CPUC opened proceeding SB 380 OII relating to SoCalGas to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including analyzing alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated. In December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the SB 380 OII finding that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is currently necessary for natural gas and electric reliability and affordable rates and closed the OII. Among other things, and subject to future CPUC biennial reviews and potential additional proceedings, the FD authorizes the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to continue operating and sets the maximum working natural gas storage level at 68.6 bcf. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we would record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, we could incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss proceeding SB 380 OII in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  51\n\n\nCARB, California’s primary regulator for GHG emissions reduction programs, is evaluating various options for reducing natural gas demand through building decarbonization measures and is considering a proposed statewide zero-emissions standard for space and water heaters. Additionally, the CEC adopted changes to the Title 24 California Building Standards Code that require newly constructed residential and commercial buildings to include heat pump technologies for space and water heating beginning in 2026. \n\nThe CPUC has an open proceeding to establish policies, processes, and rules governing safe and reliable gas system operation and long-term gas system infrastructure planning for natural gas utilities in alignment with California’s decarbonization goals. Potential outcomes include reductions in natural gas demand over time in favor of electrification, renewable energy alternatives, and/or cleaner fuels and changes to rate and cost recovery policies. \n\nA substantial reduction in or the elimination of natural gas use in California without adequate recovery of investments could result in impairment of some or all of SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, were required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or were to become stranded, which could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’, SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial conditions, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSDG&E may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned. \n\nSDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, which we discuss in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG&E and each of the other owners of SONGS is responsible for financing its share of the facility’s expenses and capital expenditures, including those related to decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E’s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to risks, including:\n\n▪the potential release of radioactive material\n\n▪the potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility\n\n▪limitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility\n\n▪uncertainties with respect to the technological, financial, and political aspects of decommissioning the facility and the long-term storage of radioactive materials\n\nSDG&E maintains the SONGS NDT to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning. Trust assets generally have been invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment due to inflationary pressures or otherwise could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, CPUC approval is required to make withdrawals from the NDT, and CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the CPUC determines the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the NDT. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur. \n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are subject to extensive regulation.\n\nRates and Other Financial Matters\n\nThe CPUC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates, except for SDG&E’s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the FERC, and conditions of service. The CPUC also regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, long-term resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings. The CPUC periodically approves SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework, as well as certain settlements with third parties and mandatory social programs. The timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; any rejection by the CPUC of settlements with third parties; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of regulators, customers and other stakeholders. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  52\n\n\nThese ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SDG&E and SoCalGas make investments under an approved CPUC framework, such as wildfire mitigation and pipeline and storage integrity and safety enhancement programs, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC filing or reasonableness review that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs. SDG&E and SoCalGas also may be required to make investments and incur other costs to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those related to California’s climate goals and policies, and the ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the corresponding ratemaking mechanisms. Recovery may be delayed and/or insufficient if the applicable ratemaking mechanism involves a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in rates or if there are material differences between the authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the actual costs incurred. Delays may also result from the administrative process, or the CPUC may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons, such as customer affordability. Even if recoverable, simultaneously investing in support of necessary safety and reliability and the regulatory requirements and demand for reliable lower-carbon energy may negatively impact the affordability of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and their and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base. The CCM applies in the interim years and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (CCM benchmark rate) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole. In October 2024, the CPUC issued an FD to modify the CCM. The FD updates the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, from 50% to 20% of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period. Any further rate changes due to a downward trigger of the CCM or the denial by the CPUC of an automatic upward trigger of the CCM could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s and the applicable utility’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss the CCM in “Part I – Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms – Sempra California – Cost of Capital Proceedings,” and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC ratemaking proceedings. In particular, SDG&E’s authorized TO5 settlement provided for an ROE of 10.60%, consisting of a base ROE of 10.10% plus the California ISO adder. In December 2024, the FERC issued an order, which SDG&E has appealed, finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the California ISO adder and that the TO5 adder refund provision has been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019. In October 2024, SDG&E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC, requested to be effective January 1, 2025, and subject to refund. SDG&E’s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG&E’s currently authorized base ROE from 10.10% to 11.75% plus the California ISO adder, for a total ROE of 12.25%. In December 2024, the FERC accepted SDG&E’s TO6 filing but suspended the effective date to June 1, 2025 and disallowed the inclusion of the California ISO adder, which SDG&E has appealed. Any unfavorable outcome in these proceedings, such as the discontinuation of the California ISO adder or not being successful in our appeal of the FERC decision finding that the TO5 adder refund provision was triggered, could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nCPUC Authority Over Operational Matters\n\nOur operations are subject to CPUC rules (and similar FERC rules), commonly referred to as “affiliate rules,” relating to transactions among SDG&E, SoCalGas and other Sempra businesses. These rules primarily impact market transactions and marketing activities involving transmission supply and capacity, including sales or other trades of natural gas or electricity within or among SDG&E and SoCalGas and Sempra and its covered affiliates. Noncompliance with these rules, as well as any changes to these rules or their interpretations or additional more restrictive CPUC or FERC rules related to transactions with affiliates, could materially adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the CPUC has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, reliability and planning, competitive conditions and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation and enforcement programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. Many of these standards and citation and enforcement programs are becoming more stringent and could subject a utility to significant penalties and fines, as well as higher operating costs. The CPUC conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and may launch \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  53\n\n\ninvestigations or open proceedings at its discretion, the results of which could include citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions to address any noncompliance, any of which may not be sufficiently funded by customer rates or at all. Any such occurrence could result in other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to SDG&E and SoCalGas in Notes 4 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRegulatory Changes and Influence of Other Organizations\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas incur significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with regulatory compliance. SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how SDG&E and SoCalGas operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, require them to incur additional expenses and compliance costs or otherwise materially adversely affect their and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups, including California Public Advocates Office, The Utility Reform Network, Utility Consumers’ Action Network and the Sierra Club. Success by any of these groups in directly or indirectly influencing legislators and regulators could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak.\n\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we describe in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve approximately 390 lawsuits including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) then pending against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak for a payment of up to $1.8 billion. Over 99% of the Individual Plaintiffs participated and submitted valid releases, and SoCalGas paid $1.79 billion in 2022 under the agreement. The Individual Plaintiffs who did not participate in the settlement (the Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs) are able to continue to pursue their claims. As of February 19, 2025, there are approximately 520 plaintiffs who are either new plaintiffs that have filed new lawsuits related to the Leak or Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs. This litigation seeks compensatory and punitive damages, property damage and diminution in property value, injunctive relief and civil penalties. Additional litigation may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses to it. The costs of defending against, settling or otherwise resolving the pending lawsuits or any new litigation could materially adversely affect SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss the risks associated with litigation above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Legal and Regulatory Risks.”\n\nSoCalGas’ loss contingency accruals do not include any amounts in excess of what has been reasonably estimated to resolve these matters, nor any amounts that may be necessary to resolve threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs. We are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFailure by the CPUC to adequately reform SDG&E’s electric rate structure could negatively impact SDG&E and Sempra.\n\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable energy generation (primarily solar installations) for residential and business customers. Depending on when the on-site generation is installed, NEM customers receive a full retail rate or a reduced retail rate for energy they generate but do not use that is fed to the utility’s power grid, which results in these customers not paying their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, but still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. As more and higher electric-use customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on remaining non-NEM customers, who effectively subsidize the unpaid NEM costs, increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation and further increases rate pressure on remaining non-NEM customers.\n\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower-use customers. In December 2023, a new Net Billing Tariff \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  54\n\n\nwas implemented for customers who interconnect their qualifying on-site renewable energy generation after April 2023. The new Net Billing Tariff revised the NEM structure for new customers with a retail export compensation rate that is better aligned with the value provided to the grid by behind-the-meter energy generation systems and retail import rates that encourage electrification and adoption of solar systems paired with storage. The new Net Billing Tariff is designed to compensate customers for the value of their exports to the grid based on avoided cost. Additionally, in response to California legislation adopted in 2022, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to broadly restructure the way fixed costs are collected, moving away from volumetric only charges and incorporating an income-graduated fixed charge for default residential rates. The intent of such a fixed charge is to establish a rate structure that allows the utility to collect a greater portion of its fixed costs on a non-volumetric basis, advance the state’s climate goals through end-use electrification and provide a more affordable rate design on average for lower-income customers. In May 2024, the CPUC adopted a residential fixed charge with implementation expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Depending on the effectiveness of the new Net Billing Tariff and fixed charge, which are uncertain, the risks associated with the existing NEM tariff and rate design, including adverse impacts on electricity rates and the reliability of the transmission and distribution system and the potential for increased customer dissatisfaction, increased likelihood of noncompliance with CPUC or other safety or operational standards, and increased power procurement, operating, capital and other costs that may not be recoverable, could continue or increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA TEXAS UTILITIES\n\nOperational and Structural Risks\n\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management, operations and policies of Oncor.\n\nVarious “ring-fencing” measures, governance mechanisms and commitments are in place that create legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand. These measures are designed to enhance Oncor’s separateness from its owners and mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted by a bankruptcy or other adverse financial development affecting its owners. These measures subject us and Oncor to various restrictions, including:\n\n▪seven members of Oncor’s 13-person board of directors must be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the NYSE in relation to Sempra and its affiliates and any other owners of Oncor, and also must have no material relationship with Sempra or its affiliates or any other owners of Oncor currently or within the previous 10 years; of the six remaining directors, two must be designated by Sempra, two must be designated by Oncor’s minority owner, TTI, and two must be current or former Oncor officers\n\n▪Oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if (i) a majority of Oncor’s independent directors or any of the directors appointed by TTI determines that it is in the best interest of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements, (ii) the payment would cause Oncor’s debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT, or (iii) unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT, Oncor’s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody’s)\n\n▪there must be certain “separateness measures” maintained to reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor from Sempra, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra or Sempra’s affiliates (other than Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries) must be on an arm’s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or membership interests for any entity other than Oncor \n\n▪a majority of Oncor’s independent directors and the directors designated by TTI that are present and voting (with at least one required to be present and voting) must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in the budget differs by more than 10% from the corresponding amounts in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable\n\nAs a result of these measures, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, operations and policies of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends or other distributions, strategic planning and other important matters. Moreover, all directors of Oncor, including the directors we have appointed, have considerable autonomy and have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may in some cases be contrary to our interests. To the extent the directors approve or Oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interest, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  55\n\n\nIndustry-Related Risks\n\nChanges in the regulation of Oncor or the regulation or operation of the electric utility industry and/or the ERCOT market could negatively affect Oncor.\n\nOncor operates in the electric utility industry and is subject to many of the same or similar risks as SDG&E and SoCalGas as we describe above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses” and “Risks Related to Sempra California,” particularly with respect to our operational risks, financial risks and specifically regulation by federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory authorities regarding rates and other financial and operational matters. Oncor operates in the ERCOT market. In ERCOT, rates are set by the PUCT based on a historical test year, and as a result, the rates Oncor is allowed to charge generally will not exactly match its costs at any given point in time and there is no assurance that it will be able to timely or fully recover its actual costs and/or earn its full return on invested capital, particularly during periods of increased capital spending by Oncor, high inflation, or increases in general interest rates relative to Oncor’s most recent base rate review. Further, the approved levels of recovery could be significantly less than requested levels, and the approved timing for recovery could differ from proposed timelines. In addition to requests to recover its costs, Oncor’s rate proceedings may contain other requests. Failure to receive approval of its requests in any rate proceeding could adversely impact Oncor, which could adversely impact us, and those impacts could be material. \n\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with the various legislative and regulatory requirements to which Oncor is subject at the federal, state, and local levels and adjusting Oncor’s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in ERCOT, and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance, may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. In addition, insufficient electric capacity within ERCOT or significant changes within ERCOT or to the ERCOT market structure that impact transmission and distribution utilities, including adverse publicity or public perception, additional regulatory requirements or oversight, could materially adversely affect Oncor. Moreover, legislative, regulatory, market or industry activities could adversely impact Oncor’s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings. For instance, the PUCT has instituted various projects reviewing the regulatory framework regarding DER and other non-traditional technologies. As DER usage continues to grow, related regulatory decisions, including with respect to ERCOT market rules and transmission and distribution utilities’ ability to invest in non-traditional electricity delivery solutions, could adversely impact Oncor’s revenues and operations. Additionally, projected load growth across the ERCOT system could, if not sufficiently addressed through system design and reliability measures, negatively impact electric infrastructure reliability and potentially cause system-wide stresses. If Oncor does not successfully respond to applicable legislative, regulatory, market or industry developments, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOncor could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments.\n\nOncor’s business is capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available at reasonable prices or on other reasonable terms in the future, or at all. Because our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor, we may elect to make capital contributions to Oncor if it fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital from other sources to finance its ongoing needs. Any such investments could be substantial, would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, may not be recovered, and could increase our indebtedness, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH’s 2016 spin-off of Vistra is deemed to be taxable.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Corp. (formerly Vistra Energy Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra’s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\n\nIn connection with the merger of EFH with a subsidiary of Sempra (the Merger), EFH received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  56\n\n\nMerger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra and EFH. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce the value associated with our investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOperational Risks\n\nProject development activities may not be successful, projects under construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget, and completed projects may not operate at expected levels or generate expected earnings or cash flows.\n\nEnergy Infrastructure Projects\n\nWe are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects in various stages of development and construction, which subject us to numerous risks. Success in developing each project depends on, among other things:\n\n▪our financial condition and cash flows and other factors that impact our ability to invest sufficient funds in the project, including for preliminary activities conducted before we determine whether the project is feasible or economically attractive \n\n▪project assessment and design and our ability to foresee and incorporate new and developing trends and technologies in the energy industry, such as projects and design solutions to help enable our and our customers’ climate goals\n\n▪our ability to reach a final investment decision or meet other milestones, which may be influenced by external factors outside our control, including the global economy and energy and financial markets, actions by regulators, achieving necessary internal and external approvals, and many of the other factors described in this risk factor\n\n▪negotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements and renegotiation in the event of delays in final investment decisions or failures to meet other specified deadlines \n\n▪identification of suitable partners, customers, contractors, suppliers and other necessary counterparties\n\n▪progressing relationships from MOUs, HOAs or similar arrangements, which are non-binding, to execution of binding, definitive agreements and participation in the project\n\n▪negotiation and maintenance of satisfactory equity, purchase, sale, supply, transportation and other appropriate commercial agreements, and satisfaction of any conditions to effectiveness of such agreements, including reaching a positive final investment decision within agreed timelines\n\n▪timely receipt and maintenance of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations under terms we find reasonable\n\n▪our project partners’, contractors’, equipment providers’ and other vendors’ and counterparties’ willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments or fulfill their contractual commitments on a timely basis\n\n▪timely, satisfactory and on-budget completion of construction, which could be negatively affected by engineering problems, work stoppages, unavailability or increased costs of materials, equipment, labor and commodities due to inflation or supply chain or other issues, and a variety of other factors, many of which we discuss above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks” and elsewhere in this risk factor\n\n▪implementation of new or changes to existing laws or regulations that impact our infrastructure or the energy sector generally\n\n▪obtaining satisfactory financing for the project, particularly when inflation and interest rates are volatile\n\n▪the absence of hidden defects on or inherited environmental liabilities for the site of the project\n\n▪timely and cost-effective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting the project\n\n▪geopolitical events and other uncertainties\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  57\n\n\nAny failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve additional costs, otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully complete the project and force us to impair or write off amounts we have invested in the project. If we are unable to complete a development project, if we experience delays, or if construction, financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions, we may not receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources expended on the project and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe operation of existing facilities and any future projects we complete involves many risks, including the potential for unforeseen design flaws, engineering challenges, or the breakdown for other reasons of facilities, equipment or processes; labor disputes or shortages; fuel interruption; environmental contamination; increasing regulatory requirements, including from regulations aiming to reduce GHG emissions; and the other operational risks that we discuss above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks.” Any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle or operating below expected levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nLNG Projects\n\nIn addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects, our LNG projects, which we discuss in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure,” also face distinct disadvantages relative to some LNG projects being pursued by other project developers, including:\n\n▪The proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the JV project financing agreements for the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and requires unanimous consent of all the members, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each member. We may not be able to satisfy the conditions under the financing agreements, receive members’ consent, obtain satisfactory conclusion on the EPC process, or obtain the extension of our non-FTA approval, in which case our ability to develop the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project would be jeopardized.\n\n▪The ECA LNG projects under construction and in development are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes and recent and proposed changes to the Mexican Constitution and certain laws in Mexico that could obstruct efforts to find or maintain suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements and hinder or halt construction and, if the projects are completed, operations. We discuss these risks under “Risks Related to Sempra Infrastructure – Legal and Regulatory Risks.” In addition, the Mexican regulatory process and overlay of U.S. regulation for natural gas exports to LNG facilities in Mexico are not well developed, which, among other factors, contributed to delays in obtaining a necessary permit from the Mexican government for the ECA LNG Phase 1 project and could cause similar delays or other hurdles in the future and lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements. Further, while we do not expect the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility, we expect construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility, which currently has firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively. In addition, the Baja California region does not have extensive sources of natural gas, and at times, particularly during the summer, natural gas supply to the region is severely constrained and may impact our costs and our ability to source all feed gas required under our ECA LNG Phase 1 supply contracts. \n\n▪The PA LNG Phase 1 project under construction is located at a greenfield site and is therefore subject to certain disadvantages relative to other projects being constructed or developed at brownfield sites, such as increased time and costs to develop and construct the project due to lack of existing infrastructure. The PA LNG Phase 2 project in development would be located at the site of the PA LNG Phase 1 project and would therefore be subject to certain advantages, as well as potential disadvantages, relative to projects being developed at greenfield sites. Advantages of brownfield development include the ability to leverage existing permits and infrastructure; disadvantages of brownfield development could include increased complexity of integrating new facilities with existing infrastructure. Additionally, in February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the DOE to permit LNG produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project to be exported to all current and future non-FTA countries, which we may not receive on a timely basis or at all.\n\nDevelopment and operation of these or any other LNG projects will depend on the expansion of our existing pipeline interconnections or the ability to permit and construct new pipeline facilities, each of which may require us to enter into additional pipeline interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines, which may not be possible on reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe capital requirements for our LNG projects can be significant, even if we decide not to make a positive final investment decision. As has happened in the past, our proposed facilities may not be completed in accordance with estimated timelines or budgets or at all as a result of the above or other factors, and delays, cost overruns or our inability to complete one or more of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  58\n\n\nWe face risks from increased competition.\n\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous capable competitors, many of which have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience domestically and internationally and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. In particular, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments recently have been characterized by strong and increasing competition for winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe are exposed to additional competitive risks in connection with our LNG projects. Our ability to reach a final investment decision for each development project and, if a positive decision is made and a project is completed, the overall success of the project depends in part on global energy markets, which can increase competition for global LNG demand in a number of ways. In general, depressed natural gas and LNG prices in the markets intended to be served by any of our projects, including as a result of global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections or other factors, could reduce the pricing and cost advantages of exporting natural gas and LNG produced in North America, which could lead to decreased demand from our projects. Although demand for natural gas is currently strong due to increased focus on energy security and climate aims, a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, reduced economic activity in general, or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate global reliance on natural gas. Further, because LNG projects take a number of years to develop and construct, it is difficult to match current and expected demand with the projected supply from projects under development. Moreover, shifts in U.S. and foreign energy policy could impact supply, demand and other matters critical to LNG projects, such as permitting and other approval processes. Both the U.S. and Mexico held federal elections in 2024, and LNG exports may face increased costs under the new Administrations due to changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Also, the DOE has recently implemented changes to its approach to requests for extensions of time to commence LNG exports under existing non-FTA approvals. These changes and other market factors such as oil prices could delay or hamper the development of U.S. LNG export facilities and make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects in North America, thus increasing supply and competition for global LNG demand. Any of these occurrences could impact competition and prospects for developing LNG projects and negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe may not be able to secure, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply, sales or capacity agreements.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s ability to secure new or maintain, extend or replace existing long-term sales or capacity agreements for its natural gas pipeline operations depends on, among other factors, demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from its transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A decrease in demand for or supply of LNG or natural gas from such customers or the occurrence of other events that hinder Sempra Infrastructure from maintaining such agreements or establishing new ones could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built, supplies of energy and related products may exceed demand, competitive pressures may increase and wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile. Without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Infrastructure’s facilities can produce at favorable prices or at all, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity.\n\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to, among other things:\n\n▪deliver the natural gas, LNG, electricity and LPG we sell to customers or use for our LNG facilities \n\n▪supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities\n\n▪provide retail energy services to customers\n\nIf transportation is disrupted, the construction of necessary interconnecting infrastructure is not completed on schedule or at all or capacity is inadequate, we may be delayed in completing projects under development and/or unable to meet our contractual obligations to customers of those projects or existing projects, in which case we may be responsible for damages they incur, such as the cost of acquiring alternative supplies at then-current spot market rates, and we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  59\n\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s business is capital-intensive and relies on various types of financing arrangements, which may not be adequate or available in the future.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s business is capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods. It relies on various types of financing to meet its capital requirements, including capital contributions from Sempra and NCI owners, as well as external financing such as loans and other forms of project financing that could impose guarantees, indemnities or other obligations. These arrangements could expose us to risks, including exposure to losses upon the occurrence of certain events related to the development, construction, operation or financing of the applicable projects. In addition, external sources of capital may not be adequate or available on reasonable terms. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. \n\nFixed-price long-term contracts for services or commodities expose our businesses to inflationary pressures.\n\nSempra Infrastructure seeks to secure long-term contracts for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of its facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. Certain of these contracts are at fixed prices, and their profitability may be negatively affected by inflationary pressures, including increased labor, materials, equipment, commodities and other operational costs, rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates. We aim to mitigate these risks by, among other things, using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating and providing for cost escalation when bidding on projects, contracting for direct pass-through of operating costs and/or entering into hedges. However, these measures may not fully or substantially offset any increases in operating expenses or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and their use could introduce additional risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate and inflation risks.\n\nOur operations in Mexico pose foreign currency exchange rate and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to Mexico and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue, cash flows and costs from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We sometimes attempt to hedge cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not fully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n\nOur businesses are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices.\n\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for pipeline operations, LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors, including inflation, adverse weather conditions, supply and demand changes, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, political and geopolitical instability, commodity production levels and storage capacity, energy and environmental legislation and regulations, and economic and financial market conditions. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal, regulatory, tax, economic, geopolitical, credit and management oversight risks and challenges.\n\nWe own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and we do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, and the occurrence of any of these \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  60\n\n\nrisks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. These risks include the following and the other risks discussed in this risk factor below: \n\n▪compliance with tax, trade, environmental and other foreign laws and regulations, including legal limitations on ownership in some foreign countries and inadequate or inconsistent enforcement of regulations\n\n▪actions by local regulatory bodies, such as the CRE, including setting rates and tariffs that may be earned by or charged to our businesses\n\n▪the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control and recovery may be delayed and/or insufficient to recover our costs\n\n▪adverse changes in social, political, economic or market conditions or the stability of foreign governments or such foreign governments’ relations with the U.S. government\n\n▪adverse rulings by or instability in foreign courts or tribunals\n\n▪challenges obtaining, maintaining and complying with permits or approvals\n\n▪difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights and differing legal standards\n\n▪expropriation or theft of assets\n\n▪demand for hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas imported from the U.S., may be impacted by geopolitical factors\n\n▪with respect to our non-utility international business activities, changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by many of the factors listed above, among others\n\nMexican Government Influence on Economic and Energy Matters\n\nThe Mexican government exercises significant and increasing influence over the Mexican energy sector and has adopted or proposed additional changes that, in each case, could impact private investment in this sector.\n\nMexican governmental actions in the past several years in the electricity market include resolutions, orders, decrees, regulations and proposed and adopted amendments to Mexican law that could, among other things, threaten the prospects for private-party renewable energy generation in the country, limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits, increase costs of electricity for legacy renewable and cogeneration energy contract holders, and limit ownership of energy assets by private companies. We discuss some of these actions in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, the government of Mexico has implemented Mexican Constitutional energy reforms that will impact energy infrastructure and markets in Mexico. We await legislative action to determine the potential impact such reforms will have on the market generally and our business in particular.\n\nWith respect to midstream and downstream activities, Mexico’s Hydrocarbons Law gives SENER and the CRE significant powers to suspend permits when a danger to national security, energy security, or the national economy is foreseen and to revoke permits under certain other circumstances, including for a failure to comply with certain minimum storage and other requirements or for violations of certain provisions established by SENER or the Hydrocarbons Law, as applicable. Recent Mexican Constitutional reforms have proposed to transfer significant powers from CRE to SENER; implementing legislation on these reforms is expected to be forthcoming.\n\nSubsequent to the federal elections in Mexico in 2024 and, as noted above, the Mexican government has begun to introduce significant changes to the Mexican Constitution, which will require changes in laws, policies, and regulations in order to be implemented. These changes have included Mexican Constitutional reforms affecting the judiciary and the for-profit status of certain state-owned enterprises. The changes to the judiciary include a requirement that all judges be elected rather than appointed. The energy reforms have the potential to increase government control and participation in the energy sector and to create novel challenges for infrastructure development and operations. Additionally, a set of six energy-related laws, including modifications to the Hydrocarbons Law and Electricity Industry Law, were submitted to Mexico’s Congress in January 2025. The legislative session runs from February 1 to April 30, and the government is targeting approval by the end of March 2025. These reforms and any further Mexican Constitutional, legal or regulatory changes could affect the Mexican economy, energy sector and our businesses, the extent of which we currently are unable to predict.\n\nIf future governmental actions are proposed and passed or otherwise become effective, if efforts to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn adopted governmental actions fail, or if other similar actions by the Mexican government are taken to curb private-party participation in the energy sector, including through further amendments to Mexican laws, rules or the Mexican Constitution or increased investigative and enforcement activities, it may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and for its power consumers, adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  61\n\n\nU.S. and Foreign Laws and International Relations\n\nOur international business activities are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and Mexico and other countries where we do business related to foreign operations and doing business internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley Federal Anticorrupción en Contrataciones Públicas) and similar laws, and are sensitive to foreign policy, trade policy and other geopolitical factors related to or applicable in each of these countries. The current and the last U.S. Administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements, tariffs, immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations. The current U.S. Administration proposed imposing new tariffs on Mexico that are currently deferred, but may become effective in the near term, and other tariffs could potentially be imposed by the current U.S. Administration. The Mexican government has announced plans to implement retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. Administration’s proposed tariffs, if and when they are imposed, but the details of those tariffs have not yet been disclosed. In addition, the U.S. Administration has announced tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum beginning on March 12, 2025. These materials are integral to the construction of energy infrastructure and could have a significant impact on the costs associated with the construction of the same, whether directly or indirectly. Other shifts in foreign policy could create uncertainty and result in or increase adverse effects on our businesses. Violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above, as well as foreign policy positions, sanctions or imposition of new or greater tariffs that adversely affect imports and exports between the U.S., Mexican and other foreign countries where we conduct business, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico.\n\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our ECA LNG projects are expected to be situated, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have and may in the future seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure on land we do not own. In addition to the risks associated with such property ownership and use that we describe above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks,” disputes regarding ownership or rights to any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nCYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas have cybersecurity risk management processes in place that are intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical infrastructure, systems and information. These cybersecurity risk management processes include cybersecurity incident response plans that are integrated into each entity’s respective enterprise risk management and emergency management programs. \n\nOur cybersecurity processes are largely designed and assessed based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and the DOE’s Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model standards. This does not imply that we meet any technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use these standards as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. \n\nOur cybersecurity risk management processes include:\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  62\n\nTable of Contents\n\n▪risk assessments performed by internal personnel and third-party advisors designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise information technology environments\n\n▪information security teams principally responsible for developing and implementing (1) cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) information security controls, and (3) response plans to cybersecurity incidents\n\n▪the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our information security controls\n\n▪cybersecurity awareness training and policies designed to address social engineering attacks targeting employees and contractors\n\n▪cybersecurity incident response plans that include procedures for responding to and reporting, if applicable, certain cybersecurity incidents\n\n▪risk management processes for third-party service providers, suppliers, and vendors\n\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nCYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE\n\nSempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ respective boards of directors consider cybersecurity risk as part of their risk oversight function. The Sempra board of directors has delegated to its SST Committee, which is entirely composed of independent directors under the independence standards established by the NYSE, oversight of cybersecurity and other information and operational technology risks. The SST Committee reports to the Sempra board of directors regarding the Committee’s activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The SST Committee receives briefings on cybersecurity topics from Sempra’s chief information security officer, internal information security staff or external experts in part for continuing education on topics that impact public companies. The SST Committee as well as the SDG&E and SoCalGas boards of directors oversee management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management processes and receive regular reports from management on our material cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the SST Committee and SDG&E and SoCalGas boards of directors about certain cybersecurity incidents. The SDG&E and SoCalGas boards of directors receive briefings from SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ chief information officer and internal information security staff. SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ boards of directors also have safety committees that, at times, may oversee the matters described above on behalf of those companies’ respective boards of directors. \n\nWe have formed cybersecurity councils to provide overall corporate oversight for managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. The cybersecurity councils meet regularly to receive updates on cybersecurity developments at Sempra and our consolidated entities from their cybersecurity management teams.\n\nOur cybersecurity management teams supervise efforts designed to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal information security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by information security tools deployed in the information technology environment. Cybersecurity management also supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Sempra’s director of cybersecurity governance & chief information security officer provides additional oversight and support for the operational cybersecurity activities at our consolidated entities.\n\nOur cybersecurity materiality assessment teams, which include chief information security officers, chief information officers, chief risk officers, chief accounting officers or chief financial officers, and general counsels, help assess the materiality of certain cybersecurity incidents. \n\nThe cybersecurity councils, cybersecurity management teams and materiality assessment teams include members with decades of operational experience as cybersecurity professionals as well as management with decades of service in the areas of information and operational technology and legal, compliance, financial reporting and enterprise risk management. Some of these members hold relevant degrees and certifications that we believe enhance our ability to manage and respond to cybersecurity risks, including, among others, bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees in cybersecurity and computer science as well as certified information systems security professional, certified incident handler, and certified information security manager certifications.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  63",

BUSINESS\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe are a California-based holding company with energy infrastructure investments in North America. Our businesses invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers.\n\nSempra was formed in 1998 through a business combination of Enova Corporation and Pacific Enterprises, the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in California: SDG&E, which began operations in 1881, and SoCalGas, which began operations in 1867. We have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into Texas through our 80.25% interest in Oncor and 50% interest in Sharyland Utilities. Sempra Infrastructure’s assets include investments in the U.S. and Mexico with a focus on LNG, energy networks and low carbon solutions.\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\nOur mission is to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company. We are primarily focused on transmission and distribution investments, among other areas, that we believe are capable of producing stable cash flows and earnings visibility, with the goals of delivering safe, reliable and increasingly clean forms of energy affordably to customers and increasing shareholder value.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT\n\nSempra’s business activities are organized under the following reportable segments:\n\n▪Sempra California\n\n▪Sempra Texas Utilities\n\n▪Sempra Infrastructure\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas each has one reportable segment.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  12\n\n\nSempra California\n\nSDG&E\n\nSDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides electric services to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 3.6 million and natural gas services to approximately 3.3 million of that population, covering an approximate 4,100 square mile service territory in Southern California that encompasses San Diego County and an adjacent portion of Orange County. \n\nSDG&E’s assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\n\nWe describe SDG&E’s electric utility operations below. We describe SDG&E’s natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SDG&E’s business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\n\nElectric Transmission and Distribution System. Service to SDG&E’s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system, which includes substations and overhead and underground lines. These electric facilities are primarily in the San Diego, Imperial and Orange counties of California, and in Arizona and Nevada and consisted of 2,021 miles of transmission lines, 24,149 miles of distribution lines and 159 substations at December 31, 2024. Occasionally, various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety. \n\nSDG&E’s 500-kV Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,163 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed by SDG&E and operated by the California ISO. Both of these lines together provide SDG&E with import capability of 3,900 MW of power.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  13\n\n\nMexico’s Baja California transmission system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction. However, it can be less under certain system conditions.\n\nSDG&E’s system is connected to Edison’s transmission system via five 230-kV transmission lines.\n\nElectric Resources. SDG&E supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a long-term basis from other suppliers for resale through CPUC-approved PPAs or purchases on the spot market. SDG&E does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes. SDG&E’s electric resources at December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n\nELECTRIC RESOURCES(1)\n\nContract expiration dateNet operating capacity (MW)% of total\n\nSDG&E:\n\nOwned generation facilities, natural gas(2)\n\n1,204 24 %\n\nPPAs:\n\nRenewable energy:\n\nWind2025 to 2042918 19 \n\nSolar2030 to 20421,526 31 \n\nOther2025 and thereafter155 3 \n\nTolling and other2025 to 20421,113 23 \n\nTotal4,916 100 %\n\n(1)    Excludes approximately 367 MW of energy storage owned and approximately 632 MW of energy storage contracted.\n\n(2)    SDG&E owns and operates four natural gas-fired power plants, three of which are in California and one is in Nevada.\n\nCharges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. Tolling contracts are PPAs under which SDG&E provides natural gas to the energy supplier. \n\nSDG&E procures natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with PPAs. Purchases from various southwestern U.S. suppliers are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices, which can be subject to volatility.\n\nSDG&E participates in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Participants can make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk.\n\nCustomers and Demand. SDG&E provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes: \n\nELECTRIC CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\n\nCustomer meter countVolumes(1)\n\n(millions of kWh)\n\nDecember 31,Years ended December 31,\n\n2024202420232022\n\nSDG&E:\n\nResidential285,881 1,348 2,004 3,940 \n\nCommercial31,313 1,363 1,868 2,850 \n\nIndustrial319 441 670 909 \n\nStreet and highway lighting1,574 55 77 101 \n\n319,087 3,207 4,619 7,800 \n\nCCA and DA1,213,258 13,484 12,228 9,900 \n\nTotal1,532,345 16,691 16,847 17,700 \n\n(1)    Includes intercompany sales.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  14\n\n\nSDG&E currently provides procurement service for a portion of its customer load. Most customers receive electric procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG&E no longer procures energy for this departed load. Accordingly, SDG&E’s CCA and DA customers receive primarily transportation and distribution services from SDG&E.\n\nCCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program, and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Several jurisdictions in SDG&E’s territory have implemented CCA, including the City of San Diego in 2022. Additional jurisdictions may be considering CCA.\n\nAs a result of customers electing CCA and DA services, SDG&E’s historical energy procurement commitments for future deliveries exceed the needs of its remaining bundled customers. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether customers’ energy is procured by SDG&E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The framework is intended to more equitably allocate SDG&E’s procurement cost obligations among customers served by SDG&E and customers now served by CCA and DA.\n\nSan Diego’s mild climate and SDG&E’s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers. Rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by SDG&E. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in SDG&E’s territory totaled 2,318 MW, 2,154 MW and 1,864 MW, respectively.\n\nElectricity demand is dependent on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, renewable power generation, the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, demand-side management impact and DER. California’s energy policy supports increased electrification, particularly electrification of vehicles, which could significantly increase sales volumes in the coming years. Other external factors, such as the price of purchased power, the use and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, the development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for and supply of natural gas and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity, which may in turn impact demand. Electricity demand is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns (or “seasonality”), tending to increase in the summer months to meet the cooling load and in the winter months to meet the heating load.\n\nCompetition. SDG&E faces competition to serve its customer load from distributed and local power generation growth, including DER. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. Certain FERC transmission development projects are open to competition, allowing independent developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  15\n\n\nSoCalGas\n\nSoCalGas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system that delivers natural gas to a population of, at December 31, 2024, approximately 21.1 million, covering an approximate 24,000 square mile service territory that encompasses Southern California and portions of central California (excluding San Diego County, the City of Long Beach and the desert area of San Bernardino County).\n\nSoCalGas’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory:\n\nWe describe SoCalGas’ natural gas utility operations below in “Sempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations.” For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing SoCalGas’ business, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California.”\n\nSempra California’s Natural Gas Utility Operations\n\nNatural Gas Procurement and Transportation. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas’ natural gas facilities included 3,037 miles of transmission and storage pipelines, 52,567 miles of distribution pipelines, 48,999 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations, and SDG&E’s natural gas facilities consisted of 188 miles of transmission pipelines, 9,201 miles of distribution pipelines, 6,794 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station.\n\nSoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s gas transmission pipelines interconnect with four major interstate pipeline systems: El Paso Natural Gas, Transwestern Pipeline, Kern River Pipeline Company, and Mojave Pipeline Company, allowing customers to bring gas supplies into the SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system from the various out-of-state gas producing basins. Additionally, an interconnection with PG&E’s intrastate gas transmission pipeline system allows gas to flow into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system. SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system also has an interconnect with a Mexican gas pipeline company at Otay Mesa on the California/Mexico border that allows gas to not only flow south from the gas producing basins in the southwestern U.S., but to also flow north into SoCalGas’ gas transmission pipeline system from supplies in Mexico. There are also several in-state gas interconnections allowing for delivery of California-produced gas, including a number of direct connections from biomethane producers.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  16\n\n\nSoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts and on the spot market for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid week indices, which can be subject to volatility. The cost of purchases of natural gas for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers is billed to those customers without markup.\n\nTo support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm and variable interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed and variable tariffed and negotiated reservation charges to reserve firm and interruptible transportation rights. Energy companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas.\n\nNatural Gas Storage. SoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 Bcf and 126 injection, withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage service. SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s core customers, along with certain third-party market participants, are allocated a portion of SoCalGas’ storage capacity. SoCalGas uses the remaining storage capacity for load balancing services for all customers and for storage for noncore customers. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 Bcf and, subject to CPUC limitations, represents 63% of SoCalGas’ working natural gas storage capacity. At December 31, 2024, SoCalGas has been authorized by the CPUC to utilize up to 68.6 Bcf of working gas at the facility.\n\nCustomers and Demand. SoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and SDG&E’s territory on a combined portfolio basis. SoCalGas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others.\n\nNATURAL GAS CUSTOMER METERS AND VOLUMES\n\nCustomer meter countVolumes (Bcf)(1)\n\nDecember 31,Years ended December 31,\n\n2024202420232022\n\nSDG&E:\n\nResidential\n\n886,031 \n\nCommercial\n\n29,009 \n\nElectric generation and transportation\n\n3,312 \n\nNatural gas sales\n\n45 48 45 \n\nTransportation\n\n38 39 39 \n\nTotal\n\n918,352 83 87 84 \n\nSoCalGas:\n\nResidential\n\n5,940,904 \n\nCommercial \n\n248,866 \n\nIndustrial\n\n23,833 \n\nElectric generation and wholesale\n\n38 \n\nNatural gas sales\n\n304 321 304 \n\nTransportation\n\n522 549 586 \n\nTotal\n\n6,213,641 826 870 890 \n\n(1)    Includes intercompany sales.\n\nFor regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers.\n\nMost core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase their natural gas supplies from producers, marketers or brokers, SoCalGas and SDG&E are obligated to maintain adequate delivery capacity to serve the requirements of all their core customers. \n\nSoCalGas’ noncore customers consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, and large commercial and industrial customers. A portion of SoCalGas’ noncore customers are non-end-users, which include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities, including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  17\n\n\nNoncore customers are responsible for procuring their natural gas requirements, as the regulatory framework does not allow SoCalGas and SDG&E to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers.\n\nNatural gas demand largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of, demand for, and supply sources of electricity, the use of and further development of renewable energy sources and energy storage, development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside California, storage levels, transport capacity and availability of supply into California and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of natural gas, which may in turn impact demand.\n\nOne of the larger drivers of natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in self-generation from rooftop solar, the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s service areas. The demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity, such as renewable energy sources. Given the significant level and availability of natural gas-fired generation, we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can continue to help provide electric reliability in our California service territories.\n\nThe natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality. Demand for natural gas in our service territory typically rises during the winter months to accommodate heating needs and the summer months to support peak electric generation. As is prevalent in the industry, subject to regulatory limitations, SoCalGas typically injects natural gas into storage during the months of April through October and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the months of November through March.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  18\n\n\nSempra Texas Utilities \n\nSempra Texas Utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings. Oncor Holdings is a wholly owned entity of Sempra that owns an 80.25% interest in Oncor. TTI owns the remaining 19.75% interest in Oncor. Sempra owns a 50% interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a 100% interest in Sharyland Utilities.\n\nSempra Texas Utilities’ assets at December 31, 2024 covered the following territory: \n\nFor a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\n\nOncor\n\nOncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution utility that operates in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. Oncor delivers electricity to end-use consumers through its electrical systems and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in Texas. Oncor’s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities, including the \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  19\n\n\ncities of Dallas and Fort Worth and surrounding suburbs, as well as Waco, Wichita Falls, Odessa, Midland, Tyler, Temple, Killeen and Round Rock, among others. Most of Oncor’s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways, streets and rights-of-way pursuant to permits, public utility easements, franchise or other agreements or as otherwise permitted by law. \n\nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor had 5,094 employees, including 836 employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement and excluding interns.\n\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, which we describe in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” are in effect and are intended to enhance Oncor Holdings’ and Oncor’s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of, or other adverse financial developments affecting, their owners. Sempra does not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends or other distributions, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions, including limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors. Because Oncor Holdings and Oncor are managed independently (i.e., ring-fenced), we account for our 100% ownership interest in Oncor Holdings as an equity method investment.\n\nElectricity Transmission. Oncor’s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations. These responsibilities consist of the construction, maintenance and security of transmission facilities and substations and the monitoring, controlling and dispatching of high-voltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ERCOT, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” \n\nAt December 31, 2024, Oncor’s transmission system included approximately 18,324 circuit miles of transmission lines, a total of 1,288 transmission and distribution substations, and interconnection to 192 third-party generation facilities totaling 58,597 MW. \n\nTransmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the PUCT or, to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets, the FERC. Network transmission revenues compensate Oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kV and above. Other services offered by Oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies, facilities studies, transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment, substations and transmission lines owned by other parties. \n\nElectricity Distribution. Oncor’s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities, including electricity delivery, power quality, security and system reliability. These responsibilities consist of the ownership, management, construction, maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area. Oncor’s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to end-users and wholesale customers through 3,757 distribution feeders at December 31, 2024.\n\nOncor’s distribution system included more than four million points of delivery at December 31, 2024 and consisted of 125,975 circuit miles of overhead and underground lines.\n\nDistribution revenues from residential and small business users are generally based on actual monthly consumption (kWh) and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on, depending on size and annual load factor, either actual monthly demand (kW) or the greater of actual monthly demand (kW) or 80% of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months. \n\nCustomers and Demand. Oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas based on the number of end-use customers and miles of transmission and distribution lines, delivering electricity to more than four million homes and businesses, operating more than 144,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines as of December 31, 2024 in a territory with an estimated population of approximately 13 million. The majority of consumers of the electricity Oncor delivers are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business. Oncor is not a seller of electricity, nor does it purchase electricity for resale. Rather, Oncor provides wholesale transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as non-affiliated electricity distribution companies, electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. Oncor also provides distribution services, consisting of retail delivery services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to end-use customers, as well as wholesale delivery services to electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. At December 31, 2024, Oncor’s distribution business customers primarily consisted of over 100 retail electric providers that sell the electricity it distributes to consumers in its certificated service areas.\n\nOncor’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers, with revenues being highest in the summer. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  20\n\n\nCompetition. Oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the PUCT. The majority of Oncor’s service territory is single certificated, with Oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider. However, in multi-certificated areas of Texas, Oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve end-use customers. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party DER and other technologies may increasingly compete with Oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers.\n\nSharyland Utilities\n\nSharyland Utilities is a regulated electric transmission utility that owns and operates, at December 31, 2024, approximately 64 miles of electric transmission lines in south Texas, including a direct current line connecting Mexico and assets in McAllen, Texas. Sharyland Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient transmission and substation services and investing to support infrastructure needs in its service territory, which we discuss below in “Regulation – Utility Regulation – ERCOT Market.” Transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\n\nSempra Infrastructure\n\nOur Sempra Infrastructure segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary, SI Partners, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. SI Partners is included within our Sempra Infrastructure reportable segment but is not the same in its entirety as the reportable segment. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help provide safe, sustainable and reliable access to cleaner energy in markets in the U.S., Mexico and globally.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra, KKR Pinnacle and ADIA each hold a 70%, 20%, and 10% interest, respectively, in SI Partners. SI Partners owns a 100% interest in Sempra LNG Holding, LP and a 99.9% interest in IEnova at December 31, 2024. \n\nThe minority partners in SI Partners and Sempra are parties to the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of SI Partners (the LP Agreement). Under the LP Agreement, matters are decided generally by majority vote and the managers designated by the partners of SI Partners each vote on an equity-weighted basis based on the ownership percentage of their respective designating limited partner. SI Partners and its controlled subsidiaries are prohibited from taking certain limited actions without the prior written approval of the minority partners. The LP Agreement contains certain default remedies if any limited partner fails to fund any amounts required to be funded under the LP Agreement and requires that SI Partners distribute to the limited partners at least 85% of distributable cash of SI Partners and its subsidiaries on a quarterly basis, subject to certain exceptions and reserves. Generally, distributions from SI Partners are made on a pro rata basis. However, KKR Pinnacle is entitled to certain priority distributions in the event of material deviations between certain specified projected cash flows and actual cash flows. Additionally, the minority partners are entitled to certain priority distributions in the event a specified project that reaches a positive final investment decision does not have projected internal rates of return greater than a specified threshold or in the event Sempra has not made a positive final investment decision by a certain date on specified LNG projects that are under development. Under the LP Agreement, if the minority partners approve Sempra’s request that a project not be pursued jointly, or if the minority partners decide not to participate in any proposed project for which Sempra nevertheless desires to make a positive final investment decision, then Sempra may proceed with such project either independently through a different investment vehicle or as a “Sole Risk Project” within SI Partners and receive Sole Risk Interests in respect thereof. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at Sempra’s sole cost, expense and liability, and Sempra receives, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, the economic and other benefits, if any, from such projects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure consolidates Sempra’s ownership and management of its non-U.S. utility, energy infrastructure assets in North America under a single platform. These assets include LNG and natural gas infrastructure in the U.S. and Mexico and renewable energy, LPG and refined products infrastructure in Mexico, which are managed through three business lines: LNG, Energy Networks and Low Carbon Solutions.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  21\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure owned or held interests in the following assets:\n\nFor a discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing Sempra Infrastructure’s business, see “Part 1 – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  22\n\n\nLNG\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s LNG business line is comprised of a natural gas liquefaction and regasification portfolio in operation, construction or development, and is focused on securely delivering natural gas to markets around the world. Sempra Infrastructure’s development and/or construction of projects, which we describe below, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nCameron LNG Phase 1 Facility. SI Partners owns 50.2% of Cameron LNG JV, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 35.1% interest in the JV. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, an affiliate of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment, LLC (a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) each own 16.6% of Cameron LNG JV. We account for our ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. No single owner controls or can unilaterally direct significant activities of Cameron LNG JV.\n\nCameron LNG JV owns and operates the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, a natural gas liquefaction, export, regasification and import facility with three natural gas pre-treatment, processing and liquefaction trains. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility is located in Hackberry, Louisiana, along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which handles significant industrial shipping, including large oil and LNG tankers, that we believe is well positioned to supply the Atlantic and Pacific markets. The three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an export capacity of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., which collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility.\n\nECA Regas Facility. SI Partners owns and operates the ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico, which is capable of processing one Bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320,000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160,000 cubic meters each.\n\nThe ECA Regas Facility generates revenues from firm storage service fees under firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively, which permit them to collectively use 50% of the terminal’s capacity, with the remaining 50% of the capacity available for Sempra Infrastructure’s use. The land on which the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects under construction and in development are expected to be situated, as well as land adjacent to those properties, are the subject of litigation. We discuss litigation, regulatory and other matters that could impact the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \n\nSempra Infrastructure uses its 50% capacity at the ECA Regas Facility to satisfy its obligation under an LNG SPA with Tangguh PSC through 2029, which we discuss below, and ECA LNG Phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter.\n\nECA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners owns an 83.4% interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, resulting in Sempra Infrastructure holding a 58.4% interest in the project. An affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6% interest in the project. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the spring of 2026.\n\nECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG.\n\nPA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners, KKR Denali and an affiliate of ConocoPhillips own a 28%, 42% and 30% interest, respectively, in the PA LNG Phase 1 project under construction on a greenfield site in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. Sempra Infrastructure holds a 19.6% interest in the project. The PA LNG Phase 1 project will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa. We expect the first and second trains of the PA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in 2027 and 2028, respectively.\n\nPA LNG Phase 1 has definitive SPAs with an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG, RWE Supply & Trading GmbH for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG, INEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG, ORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG, and ENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  23\n\n\nKKR Denali’s interest in the PA LNG Phase 1 project is governed by a limited liability company agreement under which (i) a subsidiary of SI Partners (a) is the managing member, (b) exclusively holds the right to make decisions with respect to certain expansions, such as the potential PA LNG Phase 2 project, (c) has certain rights to preferential distributions from specified revenues and expansion true-up payments, and (d) through a parent entity that is a subsidiary of Sempra, bears a disproportionately higher allocation of certain capital contribution commitments in certain budgetary overrun scenarios, and (ii) KKR Denali has certain investor protection voting rights.\n\nAsset and Supply Optimization. Sempra Infrastructure has an LNG SPA through 2029 with Tangguh PSC for the supply of the equivalent of 500 MMcf of natural gas per day at a price based on the SoCal Border index for natural gas. The LNG SPA allows Tangguh PSC to divert certain LNG volumes to other global markets in exchange for payments of diversion fees. Sempra Infrastructure may also enter into short-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at the ECA Regas Facility for sale to other parties. Sempra Infrastructure uses the natural gas produced from this LNG to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the CFE at prices that are based on the SoCal Border index. If LNG volumes received from Tangguh PSC are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the CFE, Sempra Infrastructure may purchase natural gas in the market to satisfy such commitment.\n\nSempra Infrastructure purchases, transports and sells natural gas and LNG, and has customers in both the U.S. and Mexico, including the CFE. Sempra Infrastructure may also purchase natural gas from other Sempra affiliates. Natural gas purchases and transportation arrangements are substantially backed by long-term, U.S. dollar-based contracts for the sale of natural gas to third parties (both U.S. sourced and derived from imported LNG), LNG offtake and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity.\n\nLNG Projects Under Development. Sempra Infrastructure is pursuing or evaluating the following development opportunities:\n\n▪Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, an expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility that would add one liquefaction train and debottlenecking capacity from the existing three trains\n\n▪ECA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project to be located at the site of Sempra Infrastructure’s existing ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico\n\n▪PA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure to be located adjacent to the PA LNG Phase 1 project in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas\n\n▪Vista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure in the vicinity of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico\n\nNo final investment decision has been reached for any of these potential projects.\n\nDemand and Competition. North America benefits from numerous competitive advantages as a potential supplier of LNG to world markets, including the following:\n\n▪high levels of developed and undeveloped natural gas resources, including unconventional natural gas and oil relative to domestic consumption levels\n\n▪flexible and mature oil and gas markets resulting in efficient unit costs of gas production\n\n▪availability of extensive natural gas pipeline transmission systems and natural gas storage capacity with proximity to production locations\n\nGlobal LNG demand and competition may limit North American LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match North American LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. North American LNG exports add market flexibility that is expected to facilitate additional growth of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG.\n\nOur LNG projects in development, under construction and in operation all compete globally to market and sell LNG to remarketers and end-users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG-importing countries around the world. We compete with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe. \n\nEnergy Networks \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s Energy Networks business line is comprised of a natural gas transportation and distribution network.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  24\n\n\nCross-Border Interconnections and In-Country Pipelines. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in systems for the receipt, transportation, compression and delivery of natural gas and ethane. At December 31, 2024, these systems consisted of 1,985 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines, 17 natural gas compression stations and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in Mexico. The design capacity of these pipeline assets is over 16,900 MMcf per day of natural gas, 204 MMcf per day of ethane gas and 106,000 barrels per day of ethane liquid. Capacity on Sempra Infrastructure’s pipelines and related assets is substantially contracted under long-term, U.S. dollar-based agreements with major industry participants such as the CFE, Centro Nacional de Control de Gas, PEMEX and other similar counterparties. See “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure” for a discussion about Sempra Infrastructure’s Sonora pipeline.\n\nSempra Infrastructure owns a 40-mile natural gas pipeline in south Louisiana, the Cameron Interstate Pipeline, which links the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility in Cameron Parish in Louisiana to seven pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in Texas and the northeast, midcontinent and southeast regions of the U.S. The majority of transportation capacity on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline is under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers for delivery to the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility.\n\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, a 72-mile pipeline connecting the PA LNG Phase 1 project to Gillis, Louisiana. We expect the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector to be ready for service ahead of the PA LNG Phase 1 project’s gas requirements.\n\nNatural Gas Distribution. Sempra Infrastructure owns the natural gas distribution regulated utility, Ecogas, which operates in three separate distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico. At December 31, 2024, Ecogas had approximately 3,142 miles of distribution pipeline, and approximately 163,000 customer meters serving more than 628,000 residential, commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 10 MMcf per day in 2024. Ecogas relies on supply and transportation services, including from Sempra Infrastructure and SoCalGas for the natural gas it distributes to its customers.\n\nLPG Storage and Associated Systems. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TDF, S. de R. L. de C. V. (TDF) pipeline system and the Guadalajara LPG terminal. At December 31, 2024, the TDF pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of 12-inch diameter LPG pipeline with a design capacity of 34,000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities. The TDF pipeline system runs from PEMEX’s Burgos facility in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Mexico to Sempra Infrastructure’s approximately 32,000-barrel LPG storage facility near the city of Monterrey, Mexico and is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2027. Sempra Infrastructure’s Guadalajara LPG terminal is an 80,000-barrel LPG storage facility near Guadalajara, Mexico, with associated loading and dispatch facilities, and serves the LPG needs of Guadalajara. The Guadalajara LPG terminal is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2028. Both contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for inflation.\n\nRefined Products and Natural Gas Storage. Sempra Infrastructure’s refined products storage business develops, constructs and operates systems for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products, principally gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, throughout the Mexican states of Baja California, Colima, Estado de Mexico, Puebla, Sinaloa and Veracruz for private companies, with a combined storage capacity of 4.6 million barrels fully operating as of December 31, 2024. The Topolobampo marine terminal commenced commercial operations in June 2024. Our customer contracts for our refined products storage business are structured as long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated, firm capacity storage agreements with counterparties including Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation and PEMEX. The contracted rate under these contracts is independent from each terminal’s regulated rate as determined by the CRE.\n\nSempra Infrastructure is constructing Louisiana Storage, a 12.5-Bcf salt dome natural gas storage facility to support the PA LNG Phase 1 project. The construction includes an 11-mile pipeline that will connect to the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. We expect Louisiana Storage to be ready for service in time to support the needs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\n\nDemand and Competition. Ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems. Sempra Infrastructure’s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets. The overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months, while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  25\n\n\nLow Carbon Solutions \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s Low Carbon Solutions business line is focused on commercializing and deploying low carbon solutions in support of meeting the demand for lower carbon and reliable energy supply. The portfolio of resources includes renewable energy infrastructure, a natural gas-fired power plant, as well as potential hydrogen fuel production and advanced carbon capture, usage and storage technologies that are under development. \n\nRenewable Power Generation. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity they generate to their customers, which are generally load-serving entities, as well as industrial and other customers. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities, while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities. At December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had total nameplate capacity of 1,044 MW related to its operating wind and solar power generation facilities. Generation from Sempra Infrastructure’s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight. Additionally, some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the Mexican government and related litigation, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure.”\n\nRENEWABLE POWER GENERATION\n\nLocationContract expiration dateNameplate capacity (MW)\n\nWind power generation facilities:\n\nESJ – first phaseTecate, Baja California2035155 \n\nESJ – second phaseTecate, Baja California2042108 \n\nVentikaNuevo León, Mexico2036252 \n\nSolar power generation facilities:\n\nBorder SolarCiudad Juarez, Chihuahua2032 and 2037150 \n\nDon Diego SolarBenjamin Hill, Sonora2034 and 2037125 \n\nPima SolarCaborca, Sonora2038110 \n\nRumorosa SolarTecate, Baja California203444 \n\nTepezalá SolarAguascalientes2034100 \n\nTotal1,044 \n\nNatural Gas-Fired Generation. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TdM power plant in the vicinity of Mexicali, Baja California, adjacent to the Mexico-U.S. border. TdM is a 625 MW natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant that is connected to our Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system, which enables it to receive regasified LNG from the ECA Regas Facility as well as continental gas supplied from the U.S. on the North Baja pipeline. TdM generates revenue from selling electricity and resource adequacy to the California ISO for delivery to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities.\n\nLow Carbon Solutions Projects. Sempra Infrastructure is constructing the Cimarrón Wind project, an approximately 320 MW wind generation facility in Baja California, Mexico. Sempra Infrastructure has a 20-year PPA with Silicon Valley Power for the long-term supply of renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, California. Cimarrón Wind will utilize Sempra Infrastructure’s existing cross-border high voltage transmission line to interconnect and deliver clean energy to the East County substation in San Diego County. We expect the Cimarrón Wind project to begin generating energy in late 2025 and commence commercial operations in the first half of 2026. \n\nSempra Infrastructure is also evaluating the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration development opportunity, which is a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.\n\nDemand and Competition. Sempra Infrastructure competes with Mexican and foreign companies for new energy infrastructure projects in Mexico. Some of its competitors (including public or state-operated companies and their affiliates) may have better access to capital or greater financial and other resources or advantages, which could give them a competitive advantage for such projects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  26\n\n\nSempra Infrastructure sells power from its ESJ wind power facility into California, where renewable energy demand is affected by U.S. state mandates requiring a portion of energy to come from renewable sources. These mandates are part of California’s RPS Program. The first and second phases of ESJ, which are in operation, were certified by the CEC under the RPS Program. Certification by the CEC means that the energy produced by a facility can be counted towards the RPS Program requirements, which in turn affects the demand from California load serving entities for energy from that facility. In January 2025, the CEC approved Cimarrón Wind’s application for precertification under the RPS Program.\n\nTdM competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the California electricity market. Sempra Infrastructure manages commodity price risk at TdM by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy, energy spreads hedging, ancillary services, and short-term to medium-term capacity sales.\n\nREGULATION\n\nWe discuss the material effects of compliance with all government regulations, including environmental regulations, on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nUtility Regulation\n\nCalifornia\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are principally regulated at the state level by the CPUC, CEC and CARB.\n\nThe CPUC:\n\n▪consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms;\n\n▪regulates, among other things, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “U.S. Federal;”\n\n▪has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California;\n\n▪conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters, such as safety, reliability and planning, deregulation, competition and the environment; and\n\n▪regulates the interactions and transactions of SDG&E and SoCalGas with Sempra and other affiliates, including their marketing functions.\n\nThe CPUC also oversees and regulates other energy-related products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations.\n\nThe CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC:\n\n▪determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;\n\n▪sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;\n\n▪promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within California;\n\n▪maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and\n\n▪certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.\n\nThe CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and transportation and distribution costs. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ long-term investment decisions.\n\nWe discuss regulatory oversight by CARB below in “Environmental Matters – Air Quality and GHG Emissions.”\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  27\n\n\nTexas\n\nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities. The PUCT has original jurisdiction over wholesale transmission rates and services and retail rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the PUCT, and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the retail rates, retail services, and ordinances of municipalities. Generally, the Texas PURA prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility (as defined by PURA) that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority (i.e., the PUCT or the municipality with original jurisdiction). \n\nAt the state level, PURA requires utility owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide open-access wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system. The PUCT has adopted rules implementing the state open-access requirements for all utilities that are subject to the PUCT’s jurisdiction over electric transmission services, including Oncor. \n\nU.S. Federal\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also regulated at the federal level by the FERC, the EPA, the DOE and the DOT, and for SDG&E the NRC.\n\nThe FERC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC also regulates SDG&E’s transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return and rates of depreciation on transmission investment, electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts. The U.S. Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service. The California IOUs’ electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the California ISO. As member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which we discuss below. To a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets, Oncor’s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the FERC.\n\nThe NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the U.S., including SONGS, in which SDG&E owns a 20% interest, and which permanently ceased operations in 2013. The NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of these facilities’ safety, radiological and environmental aspects. We provide further discussion of SONGS matters, including the closure and decommissioning of the facility, in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe EPA implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment, including federal laws on air quality, water quality, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, and hazardous waste disposal and remediation. The EPA also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their regulations. As a result, SDG&E, SoCalGas, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations.\n\nThe DOT, through PHMSA, has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures, including procedures intended to manage cybersecurity risks, applicable to SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, as well as natural gas storage facilities. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. \n\nERCOT Market\n\nAs member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which represents approximately 90% of the electricity consumption in Texas. ERCOT is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in Texas and the ISO of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems. ERCOT is subject to oversight by the PUCT and the Texas Legislature. ERCOT is responsible for ensuring reliability, adequacy and security of the electric systems, as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants, in the ERCOT region. ERCOT’s membership consists of corporate and associate members, including electric cooperatives, municipal power agencies, independent generators, independent power marketers, transmission service providers, distribution service providers, independent retail electric providers and consumers. \n\nThe PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas’ main interconnected electric transmission grid. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities, along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in Texas, assist the ERCOT ISO in its operations. Each of these Texas utilities has planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and security responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and the load-serving substations it owns, primarily within its certificated distribution service area. Each participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning, designing, constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ERCOT transmission grid. These transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs, support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  28\n\n\nOncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the Texas Reliability Entity, Inc., an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ERCOT region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, including critical infrastructure protection, and ERCOT protocols.\n\nOther U.S. State and Local Territories Regulation\n\nSDG&E has electric franchise agreements with the two counties and the 27 cities in its electric service territory, and natural gas franchise agreements with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory. These franchise agreements allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity or natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2028 to 2041. SDG&E has electric and natural gas franchises for the City of San Diego. These franchise agreements, which went into effect in July 2021, provide SDG&E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for the next 20 years, consisting of 10-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional 10 years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewal. These franchise agreements have been challenged in two lawsuits that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSoCalGas has natural gas franchise agreements with the 12 counties and the 232 cities in its service territory. These franchise agreements allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2026 to 2069. In December 2024, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors granted SoCalGas a new, 20-year gas pipeline franchise. The franchise consists of an initial 10-year term beginning on January 9, 2025, followed by a 10-year term that Los Angeles County has the option to terminate. Prior to the granting of the new franchise, SoCalGas continued to serve customers in the unincorporated territory of Los Angeles County in accordance with its prior franchise.\n\nOther U.S. Regulation\n\nThe FERC regulates certain Sempra Infrastructure assets pursuant to the U.S. Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG facilities. \n\nThe FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at Sempra Infrastructure are market-based for wholesale electricity sales, cost-based for the transportation of natural gas, and market-based for the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s investment in Cameron LNG JV is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. Under these regulations, the DOE acts on LNG export applications to non-FTA countries after completing a public interest review that includes several criteria, including economic and environmental review of the proposed export. Sempra Infrastructure’s other potential natural gas liquefaction projects would, if completed, be subject to similar regulations.\n\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and businesses in which Sempra Infrastructure invests are subject to the DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT’s national regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. PHMSA also regulates the safety of onshore LNG facilities.\n\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nForeign Regulation\n\nOperations and projects in our Sempra Infrastructure segment are subject to regulation by the CRE, ASEA, SENER, the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Mexico (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), and other labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico. New energy infrastructure projects may also require a favorable opinion from Mexico’s Competition Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica) in order to be constructed and operated. Recent Mexican Constitutional reforms have proposed to transfer significant powers from the CRE to SENER; implementing legislation on these reforms is expected to be forthcoming.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  29\n\n\nLicenses and Permits\n\nOur utilities in California and Texas obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for, as applicable, the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities, some of which may require periodic renewal. \n\nSempra Infrastructure obtains numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for its electric and natural gas distribution, generation and transmission systems from the local governments where these services are provided. The permits for generation, transportation, storage and distribution operations at Sempra Infrastructure are generally for 30-year terms, with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions. Sempra Infrastructure obtains licenses and permits for the construction, operation and expansion of LNG facilities and for the import and export of LNG and natural gas. Sempra Infrastructure also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products. Sempra Infrastructure obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market. Most of the permits and licenses associated with Sempra Infrastructure’s construction and operations are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or expected useful life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years.\n\nRATEMAKING MECHANISMS\n\nSempra California\n\nGeneral Rate Case Proceedings\n\nA CPUC GRC proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. The proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements and provides for attrition, or annual increases in revenue requirements, for each year following the test year. Both the test year revenue requirements and attrition authorize how much SDG&E and SoCalGas can collect from their customers in base rates.\n\nWe discuss the GRC in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCost of Capital Proceedings \n\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and return on rate base, which is a weighted average of the authorized returns on debt, preferred equity and common equity (referred to as ROE), weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure. The authorized return on rate base approved by the CPUC is the rate that SDG&E and SoCalGas use to establish customer rates to finance investments in CPUC-regulated electric distribution and generation, natural gas distribution, transmission and storage assets, as well as general PP&E and information technology systems investments to support operations.\n\nThe CPUC established the CCM to apply in the interim years between required cost of capital applications and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (the CCM benchmark) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). The index applicable to SDG&E and SoCalGas is based on each utility’s credit rating. The CCM benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the CCM is triggered in each measurement period, which occurs if the change in the applicable Moody’s utility bond index relative to the CCM benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus 1.00% for the measurement period. The CCM, if triggered, would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized ROE upward or downward by 20% of the difference between the CCM benchmark rate and the applicable Moody’s utility bond index during the measurement period, subject to regulatory approval. Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole.\n\nWe discuss the cost of capital and CCM in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  30\n\n\nTransmission Rate Cases \n\nSDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. The proceeding establishes a ROE and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using (i) a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments, and (ii) a true-up period, similar to balancing account treatment, that is designed to provide earnings equal to SDG&E’s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment. SDG&E makes annual filings with the FERC to update rates for the following calendar year. SDG&E may also file for ROE incentives that might apply under FERC rules. SDG&E’s debt-to-equity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year.\n\nWe discuss the latest FERC rate matters in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra California” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms \n\nSoCalGas is subject to the GCIM and is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties depending on its performance in relation to specific benchmarks. We discuss the GCIM in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOther Cost-Based Regulatory Recovery\n\nThe CPUC, and the FERC as it relates to SDG&E, authorize SDG&E and SoCalGas to collect, or in the case of CPUC programmatic activities, to apply for additional, revenue requirements beyond base rates from customers for certain operating and capital related costs (depreciation, taxes and return on rate base), including for: \n\n▪costs to purchase natural gas and electricity; \n\n▪costs associated with administering public purpose, demand response, environmental compliance, and customer energy efficiency programs; \n\n▪other programmatic activities, such as gas distribution, gas transmission, gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation; and\n\n▪costs associated with third party liability insurance premiums.\n\nAuthorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered. To the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs, the differences are generally recovered or refunded in a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism. In general, the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met when the costs are incurred. Because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues. The CPUC and the FERC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program’s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from customers.\n\nSempra Texas Utilities\n\nRates and Cost Recovery \n\nOncor’s and Sharyland Utilities’ rates are each regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities, and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide assurance as to achievement of earnings levels or recovery of actual costs. Instead, their rates are based on an analysis of each utility’s costs and capital structure in a designated test year, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of the Texas utilities’ costs to have been prudently incurred and therefore fully recoverable. The approved levels and timing of recovery could differ significantly from requested levels and timing. There can also be no assurance that the PUCT will approve any other items requested in any rate proceeding or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the Texas utilities’ actual post-test year costs and/or the full return on invested capital allowed by the PUCT, particularly during periods of increased capital spending, high inflation or increases in interest rates resulting in increased costs relative to the utility’s most recent base rate review.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  31\n\n\nPUCT rules provide that a transmission and distribution utility must file a comprehensive base rate review within four years of the last order in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding unless an extension is otherwise approved by the PUCT. However, the PUCT or any city retaining original jurisdiction over rates may direct the utility to file a base rate review, or the utility may voluntarily file a base rate review, any time prior to that deadline. Pursuant to these rules, Oncor’s next base rate review must be filed no later than June 2027. \n\nWe discuss Oncor’s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Texas Utilities.”\n\nSharyland Utilities’ 2020 rate case became effective in July 2021 and remains effective until the next rate case is finalized, which we expect could be in late 2025.\n\nIn addition, PUCT rules allow Texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to recover distribution-related investments placed into service between base rate review proceedings. PUCT rules also allow the Texas utilities to file up to two interim rate adjustment applications per year to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital. These applications for interim rate adjustments between base rate reviews, known as “capital tracker” provisions, are intended to encourage transmission and distribution investments in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by helping to shorten the time period between a utility’s investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and its ability to start recovering and earning a return on such investments. However, all investments included in a capital tracker are ultimately subject to prudence review by the PUCT in the next base rate review, after such assets are put into service.\n\nCapital Structure and Return on Equity \n\nIn April 2023, the PUCT issued a final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review that set Oncor’s authorized ROE at 9.7%, a decrease from its previously authorized ROE of 9.8%, and maintained Oncor’s authorized regulatory capital structure at 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity.\n\nSharyland Utilities’ PUCT-authorized ROE is 9.38% and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 60% debt to 40% equity. \n\nSempra Infrastructure\n\nEcogas’ revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in Mexican pesos. The price Ecogas pays to purchase natural gas, which is based on international price indices, is passed through directly to its customers. The service and distribution fees charged by Ecogas are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to end-users. Ecogas’ rate case for 2021 through 2025 was approved by the CRE in December 2023. The tariffs operate under a return-on-asset-base model. In the annual tariff adjustment, rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates, and inflation indexing includes separate U.S. and Mexican cost components so that U.S. costs can be included in the final distribution rates.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nWe discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.” You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.\n\nHazardous Substances\n\nThe CPUC’s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. For sites that are covered by this mechanism, SDG&E and SoCalGas are permitted to recover in rates 90% of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70% of related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, SDG&E and SoCalGas can retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.\n\nWe record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  32\n\n\nAir Quality and GHG Emissions\n\nThe natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and GHG emissions standards. AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing GHG emissions. The law requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emissions reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office. Sempra Infrastructure is also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB.\n\nCalifornia requires certain electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the RPS Program. SB 100 (enacted in 2018) and SB 1020 (enacted in 2022) require each California electric utility, including SDG&E, to procure at least 50% of its annual retail electricity delivered from renewable energy or zero-carbon sources by 2026, 60% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 95% by 2040. SDG&E expects to be in compliance with these RPS program requirements. State law also requires California’s retail electricity supply to be met with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon sources by 2045 without increasing carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid or allowing resource shuffling, and instructs the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies to incorporate this requirement into all relevant planning. In addition, AB 1279 (enacted in 2022) requires the State of California to achieve net-zero GHG emissions no later than 2045, and to achieve and maintain net negative GHG emissions thereafter. AB 1279 also directs CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect major sectors of California’s economy, including energy utilities, transportation, agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Other state climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal include executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles, including SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ light-duty fleet vehicles, to be zero-emission by 2035. \n\nCalifornia has implemented a biomethane procurement program, whereby IOUs providing gas service in California will procure a portion of the natural gas they deliver from biomethane. The rules governing this program are administered by the CPUC under SB 1440, whereby the proportion of biomethane procured will be phased-in with a state-wide, short-term target in 2025 of 17.6 Bcf per year and a medium-term target in 2030 of 72.8 Bcf per year. SDG&E and SoCalGas are allocated 6.77% and 49.26%, respectively, of the 2025 target, and 7.60% and 52.02%, respectively, of the 2030 target. The CPUC is currently evaluating public comments to inform their review of the pending Renewable Gas Procurement Plans filed by the California gas IOUs and work towards identifying potential enhancements to the biomethane procurement program structure, including areas such as increasing market competition, reducing potential barriers for biomethane producers, streamlining procurement requirements, and improving alignment with regulatory goals.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas generally recover the costs to comply with these standards in rates. We discuss GHG emissions standards, allowances and obligations and RECs in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district’s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nSempra continues to decarbonize its operations with an aim to have net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 and an interim target of 50% scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reductions by 2035 (this interim target applies to Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure’s Mexico (non-LNG) operations and is relative to a 2019 baseline). While the company no longer has a specific goal to achieve net-zero scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050, Sempra continues to advocate for programs and initiatives that support regulatory, consumer and market demand for lower- and zero-carbon energy. Additionally, although SDG&E and SoCalGas continue to support California’s goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, their respective abilities to achieve their net-zero aspirations, as well as Sempra’s ability to achieve its 2035 and 2050 net-zero aspirations, will depend on the development, commercialization and regulatory acceptance of affordable lower carbon generation resources and cleaner fuels, among other factors. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our net-zero and other climate aims, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\n\nWith respect to our net-zero aims, even in a state of “net-zero,” GHG emissions may still be generated, but with innovation and continued development of new technology and solutions, it could allow an equal amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent to be removed from the atmosphere, resulting in a zero increase in overall net emissions. In addition, for purposes of these net-zero aims, we expect that achievement of net-zero GHG emissions will be determined based on operations in 2050 and GHG emissions will be calculated according to widely accepted emissions reporting guidelines or mandates at that time, and our net-zero aim does not include Oncor, which sets its own goals due to certain ring-fencing measures that limit Sempra’s ability to direct the management or activities of Oncor.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  33\n\n\nOTHER MATTERS\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nNameAge(1)\n\nPositions held over last five yearsTime in position\n\nSempra:\n\nJeffrey W.

We strive to foster a strong safety culture and reinforce this culture through various policies, programs and systems designed to mitigate the occurrence and extent of safety incidents, including, training programs, benchmarking, review and analysis of safety trends, internal compliance assessments and audits, and sharing lessons learned from safety incidents and near misses across our businesses. Our businesses also engage in safety-related scenario planning and simulation, develop and implement operational contingency plans, and review safety plans and procedures with work crews regularly. We also participate in emergency planning and preparedness in the communities we serve and train critical employees in emergency management and response each year. The SST Committee assists the Sempra board of directors in overseeing the company’s oversight programs and performance related to safety, and our executives’ annual incentive compensation is based in part on safety metrics established by the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the board.\n\nIn addition, we strive to create a high-performing, inclusive and supportive workplace where employees of all backgrounds and experiences feel valued and respected. We invest in recruiting, developing and retaining high-performing employees who represent the communities we serve, and we provide a range of programs for employees, including internal and external mentoring and leadership training and workshops, employee resource groups, and a benefits package including wellness benefits and a tuition reimbursement program. We also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities as well as regular executive communications to employees on topics of interest. In addition, we offer a variety of employee community service opportunities, and at our U.S. operations, we support employees’ personal volunteering and charitable giving through the charitable matching program of Sempra Foundation, which was founded and is solely funded by Sempra. Employees participate in annual ethics and compliance training, which includes a review of Sempra’s Code of Business Conduct as well as information about resources such as Sempra’s ethics and compliance helpline. We measure culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including pulse surveys, suggestion boxes and a biannual engagement survey administered by a third party.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  36\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of employees for each of the Registrants at December 31, 2024, as well as the number of those employees represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment. We did not experience any major work stoppages in 2024, and we maintain constructive relations with our labor unions.\n\nNUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\n\nNumber of employeesNumber of employees covered under collective bargaining agreementsNumber of employees covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year\n\nSempra(1)\n\n16,773 6,335 4,895 \n\nSDG&E4,779 1,440 — \n\nSoCalGas8,829 4,850 4,850 \n\n(1)    Excludes employees of equity method investees.\n\nLabor Relations\n\nField, technical and most clerical employees at SoCalGas are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America or the International Chemical Workers Union Council. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages, hours, working conditions, and medical and other benefit plans was due to expire on September 30, 2024, but was extended by mutual agreement through February 7, 2025, while SoCalGas and the unions continued negotiations. Two ratification votes in late 2024 were not successful. SoCalGas is currently operating under the terms of the expired agreement while the parties continue to negotiate revised terms and seek a positive ratification vote from union members. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions, though we do not anticipate that such labor disruptions would have a material impact on service.\n\nCOMPANY WEBSITES\n\nThe Registrants’ website addresses are:\n\n▪Sempra – www.sempra.com\n\n▪SDG&E – www.sdge.com\n\n▪SoCalGas – www.socalgas.com\n\nWe make available free of charge on the Sempra website, and for SDG&E and SoCalGas, via a hyperlink on their websites, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe references to our websites in this report are not active hyperlinks and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the websites of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas or any other website referenced herein is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this report or any other document that we file with or furnish to the SEC.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  37\n\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nWhen evaluating our company and its consolidated entities and any investment in our or their securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC (including those filed subsequent to this report). We also may be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of these risks occurs, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, and the trading prices of our securities and those of our consolidated entities could decline. These risk factors are not prioritized in order of importance or materiality, and they should be read together with the other information in this report, including in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A.”\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA \n\nOperational and Structural Risks\n\nSempra’s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations largely depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments.\n\nWe are a holding company and substantially all the assets that produce our earnings are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control, including equity method investments. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on distributions from our subsidiaries and equity method investments, which in turn depend on their ability to execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, dividend payments to third-party owners (if any) and debt and other obligations. In addition, entities accounted for as equity method investments, which we do not control, and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from doing so by legislation, regulation or contractual restrictions, in times of financial distress or in other circumstances. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra’s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of each entity’s trade and other creditors. When Sempra is a creditor of any such entity, its rights as a creditor are effectively subordinated to any security interest in the entity’s assets and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by Sempra. In addition, Sempra may elect to make capital contributions to its subsidiaries, which are not required to be repaid and are structurally subordinated to claims by creditors of the applicable subsidiary.\n\nOur investments in businesses we do not control expose us to risks.\n\nWe have investments in businesses we do not control or manage or in which we share control. In some cases, we engage in arrangements with or for these businesses that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment, including guarantees, indemnities and loans. For businesses we do not control, we are subject to the decisions of others, which may be adverse to our interests. When we share control of a business with other owners, any disagreements among the owners about strategy, financial, operational, transactional or other important matters could hinder the business from moving forward with key initiatives or taking other actions and could negatively affect the relationships among the owners and the efficient functioning of the business. In addition, irrespective of whether we control these businesses, we could be responsible for liabilities or losses related to these businesses or elect to make capital contributions to these businesses. Any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these investments in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur business could be negatively affected by activist shareholders.\n\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to activist shareholder attention. Activist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or assert influence on our board of directors and management. In taking these steps, activist shareholders could seek to acquire our capital stock, in spite of the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other takeover of our company, even when our shareholders might consider such a change of control to be in their best interests. At certain ownership levels, these acquisitions of our common stock could threaten our ability to use some or all of our NOL or tax credit carryforwards if our corporation experiences an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules. Responding to activist \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  38\n\n\nshareholders can be costly and time-consuming and requires time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from our business strategies. \n\nAny actual or perceived instability in our future direction, inability to execute our strategies, or changes in our board of directors or management team arising from activist shareholder campaigns could be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFinancial and Capital Stock-Related Risks\n\nSuccessfully completing our five-year capital expenditures plan is subject to certain risks.\n\nThe execution of our five-year capital expenditures plan may not be completed in accordance with current expectations or produce the desired results. Factors that have historically impacted and could continue to impact the amount, timing and types of capital expenditures we make include the cost and availability of financing; economic and market conditions; regulatory approvals; changes in tax law; business opportunities providing desirable rates of return; forecasts related to safety, reliability and load growth, gas system planning, and transportation electrification; safety and environmental requirements and climate-related policies; and cooperation of third-parties, including customers, partners, suppliers, lenders and others. We discuss these and other relevant factors under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses” below. We aim to finance our five-year capital expenditures plan in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas may be required to make significant expenditures before they can request rate recovery for certain capital projects. There can be no guarantee that such capital expenditures will be recoverable through rates. A significant portion of Oncor’s five-year capital expenditures plan is attributable to expected growth in ERCOT, particularly due to increased demand from large commercial and industrial customers. Changes in projected growth in ERCOT could materially impact Oncor’s capital expenditures and consequently our capital expenditures plan. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that any of Oncor’s capital expenditures will ultimately be recoverable through rates.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSettlement provisions contained in the forward sale agreements we may enter into in connection with our ATM program subject us to certain risks.\n\nIn November 2024, Sempra established an ATM program, which we discuss in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We are permitted to sell shares of our common stock in the ATM program pursuant to forward sale agreements, which grant each counterparty (each a forward purchaser) the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (or, in certain cases, the portion thereof that the forward purchaser determines is affected by the relevant event) and require us to physically settle the forward sale agreement on a date specified by the forward purchaser if, subject to a prior notice requirement:\n\n▪the forward purchaser determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it is unable to hedge in a commercially reasonable manner its exposure to the applicable forward sale agreement because insufficient shares of our common stock are made available for borrowing by securities lenders or that, with respect to borrowing such number of shares of our common stock, it would incur a rate that is greater than the borrow cost specified in the forward sale agreement;\n\n▪we declare any dividend, issue or distribution to existing holders of shares of our common stock that constitutes an extraordinary dividend under the forward sale agreement or is payable in (i) cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (ii) securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price;\n\n▪an event (i) is announced that, if consummated, would result in an extraordinary event (including certain mergers and tender offers, our nationalization, our insolvency and the delisting of the shares of our common stock) or (ii) occurs that would constitute a hedging disruption or change in law;\n\n▪an ownership event (as such term is defined in the forward sale agreement) occurs; or\n\n▪certain other events of default, termination events or other specified events occur, including, among other things, a change in law.\n\nA forward purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate all or a portion of the settlement of its forward sale agreement and to require us to physically settle the relevant shares will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  39\n\n\nIn such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement, which would result in dilution to our EPS and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, Series C preferred stock and any other series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.\n\nThe forward price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor. If the specified daily rate is less than the applicable spread on any day, this will result in a daily reduction of the forward price. In addition, the forward price will be subject to decrease on certain dates specified in the relevant forward sale agreement by the amount per share of quarterly dividends we expect to declare on our common stock during the term of such forward sale agreement.\n\nWe will generally have the right, in lieu of physical settlement of any forward sale agreement, to elect cash or net share settlement in respect of any or all of the shares of our common stock subject to such forward sale agreement. If we elect to cash or net share settle all or any part of any forward sale agreement, we would expect to issue a substantially lower number of shares than if we settled by physical delivery, but would not receive the cash for the shares that would have otherwise been issued if we settled the entire forward sale agreement by physical delivery and, as a result, would not derive the same credit metrics benefits.\n\nIf the price of our common stock at which these purchases are made by such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) exceeds the applicable forward price, we will pay such forward purchaser an amount in cash equal to such difference (if we elect to cash settle) or we will deliver to such forward purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a market value equal to such difference (if we elect to net share settle). Any such difference could be significant and could require us to pay a significant amount of cash or deliver a significant number of shares of our common stock to such forward purchaser.\n\nThe purchase of shares of our common stock by a forward purchaser or its affiliate to unwind the forward purchaser’s hedge position could cause the price of our common stock to increase above the price that would have prevailed in the absence of those purchases (or prevent a decrease in such price), thereby increasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that we would owe such forward purchaser upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement or decreasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that such forward purchaser would owe us upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement.\n\nThe economic interest, voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue. \n\nAt February 19, 2025, we had 651,457,249 shares of our common stock and 900,000 shares of our non-convertible series C preferred stock outstanding. Our businesses have substantial capital needs, and we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity, including in our ATM program, or convertible debt securities in potentially significant amounts depending in part on the prevailing market price of our common stock, which at times experiences substantial volatility. Any future issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\n\nThe dividend requirements of our preferred stock subject us to risks. \n\nAny failure to pay scheduled dividends on our series C preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of the series C preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series C preferred stock. Additionally, the terms of the series C preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods, the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to elect two additional members to our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO ALL SEMPRA BUSINESSES\n\nOperational Risks\n\nOur businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and systems that support this infrastructure.\n\nOur facilities and the systems that interconnect and/or manage them are subject to risks of, among other things, equipment or process failures due to aging or degrading infrastructure or otherwise; human error; loss or outage of a key technology platform or system; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, materials, commodities or labor, which have been and may in the future be \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  40\n\n\nexacerbated by supply chain and gas transportation capacity constraints, tight labor markets, and cost increases due to inflationary pressures, tariffs or otherwise, that may not be recoverable in a timely manner or at all; operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements or governmental interventions or permitting delays; inability to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply or transportation contracts; and performance below expected levels. Our businesses undertake capital investment projects to construct, replace, operate, maintain and upgrade facilities and systems, but such projects may not be completed or effective at managing these risks and involve significant costs that may not be recoverable. We often rely on third parties, including contractors, to perform work related to these projects and other maintenance activities, which may subject us to liability for safety issues and the quality of work performed. Because some of our facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, including customer-side-of-meter facilities, natural gas pipelines and power generation facilities that produce most of the power we distribute, the operation of our facilities could also be materially adversely affected by these or similar risks to such third-party systems, which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us.\n\nAdditional risks associated with our ability to safely and reliably construct, replace, operate, maintain and upgrade facilities and systems, which may be beyond our control, include:\n\n▪failure to meet customer demand for electricity and/or natural gas, including electric or gas outages\n\n▪gas surges into homes or other properties\n\n▪release of hazardous or toxic substances, including gas leaks\n\n▪other incidents impacting the health, safety, or security of employees, contractors, the public or our infrastructure\n\n▪failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events \n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect supply and demand for electricity, natural gas or other forms of energy, cause unplanned outages, damage our assets and/or operations or those of third parties on which our businesses rely, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. In addition, if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and related facilities, which could prevent, limit or delay existing or proposed operations or projects, increase our costs, and result in breaches of permits or contracts and related legal costs, impairments, fines or penalties. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to severe weather, natural disasters, physical attacks and other similar events.\n\nOur facilities and infrastructure may be damaged as a result of physical risks, such as extreme temperatures, storms, droughts and other severe weather; natural disasters, including wildfires (such as the LA Fires), land movement, earthquakes, and solar flares; climate-related conditions, including sea level rise and coastal erosion; accidents, including explosions and excavation damage to pipelines; or acts of terrorism, war, or criminality. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable, explosive and radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as to the surrounding communities for which we could be liable, are substantially greater than the potential risks to a typical business. \n\nSuch incidents could result in operational disruptions, electric or gas outages, property damage, personal injury or death and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects, such as fires; leaks or spills of gases, natural gas odorant or radioactive material; damage to natural resources; or other impacts to affected communities. Any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings and/or increase costs, including maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts associated with claims against us, and regulatory fines, penalties and disallowances. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, which we discuss below under “Risks Related to Sempra California – Operational Risks.” For our regulated utilities, these costs may not be recoverable in rates or recovery may be insufficient or delayed. Insurance coverage for these costs may continue to increase or become prohibitively expensive, be disputed by insurers, or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at adequate levels or in certain geographic locations, and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors. We discuss the risks related to insurance for wildfire liabilities below under “Risks Related to Sempra California — Operational Risks.” Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation and communication channels, which could negatively affect our ability to operate. Moreover, weather-related incidents have become more prevalent, unpredictable and severe due to climate change or other factors. As a result, these incidents could have a greater impact on our businesses than currently anticipated and, for our regulated utilities, rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  41\n\n\nWe face evolving cybersecurity and technology resiliency risks associated with the energy grid, pipelines, storage and other infrastructure as well as the collection of personal, sensitive and confidential information.\n\nOur significant use of and reliance on complex technologies and information systems in our operations, including our increasing deployment of new technologies, such as advanced forms of automation and artificial intelligence, and virtualization of many business activities, and our collection and retention of personal, sensitive and confidential information, represent large-scale opportunities for attacks on, vulnerabilities in or other failures of our information systems, information and energy grid and infrastructure. Our digitalization and grid modernization efforts, including the networking of operational technology assets such as substations, continue to increase the potential vulnerabilities and points of failure in our information systems. We are also at risk of attacks on, vulnerabilities in or other failures of third-party vendors’ and/or regulators’ technologies and systems, depending on the level of access these vendors and agencies have to our information and systems. Viruses, ransomware, malware and other forms of cyber-attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructure are continuously increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, may not be recognized until launched against a target and may further escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, making it impossible for us to eliminate this risk.\n\nOur businesses also face challenges related to data governance, including the need to manage and secure large volumes of electronic data with the aim to meet regulatory requirements and create a foundation for the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. SDG&E and SoCalGas are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer personal information and energy use data) to support state energy initiatives, increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized access of sensitive information. Moreover, all our businesses operating in California (and in other states and countries that have similar laws) are subject to enhanced state privacy laws, which require companies that collect information about California residents to, among other things, disclose their data collection, use and sharing practices; allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and assume liability for unauthorized disclosure of certain highly sensitive personal information.\n\nAlthough we make significant investments in risk management, technology resiliency and information security measures for the protection of our systems and data, these measures could be insufficient or otherwise fail, particularly against attacks involving sophisticated adversaries, including nation-state actors, or outages involving key technology vendors. The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing these measures are significant and expected to increase to address evolving cyber risks. We often rely on third-party vendors to deploy new technologies and maintain and update our systems (including providing security updates), and these third parties may not have adequate risk management, technology resiliency and information security measures with respect to their systems or may fail to timely provide and install software updates. Although we have not experienced a material breach of our information systems or data, we and some of our vendors have been and will likely continue to be subject to breaches of and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems or data or efforts to otherwise disrupt our operations. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with applicable data privacy and security laws or any incidents impacting our or our vendors’ information systems; the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines or our distribution, storage and other infrastructure; or our personal, sensitive and confidential information could result in disruptions to our business operations, regulatory compliance failures, inability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, energy delivery failures, financial and reputational loss, litigation, violations of applicable laws and fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Although Sempra currently maintains cyber liability insurance, this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover the costs associated with a cybersecurity incident, and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates we believe are reasonable.\n\nWe actively seek opportunities in the market through acquisitions, partnerships, JVs and divestitures.\n\nWe diligently analyze the financial viability of each acquisition, divestiture, partnership and JV we pursue. However, our diligence may prove to be insufficient and there could be latent or unforeseen defects. In addition, we may not realize all the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships or JVs for various reasons, including difficulties integrating or separating operations and personnel effectively or in a timely manner, higher or unexpected transaction or operating costs, unknown liabilities, and fluctuations in markets. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to increasing activities and projects intended to advance new energy technologies.\n\nWe regularly participate in research, development and demonstration projects and other activities designed to develop new technologies in the energy space, including those related to hydrogen, liquefaction, energy storage, microgrids, carbon sequestration, and grid modernization. These activities and projects involve significant employee time, as well as substantial capital resources that may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may not be \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  42\n\n\nable to be passed through to customers. We have sought and continue to seek a variety of federal and state funding opportunities, such as government incentives and subsidies under the IRA, for these activities and projects. These efforts can involve significant employee resources and increased compliance requirements and have not always been successful in securing funding on acceptable terms or at all. In some cases, applicable compliance requirements may cost more than the potential funding opportunity, limiting our ability to pursue available funding. In addition, the timing to complete these activities and projects is inherently uncertain and may require significantly more resources than we initially anticipate. Moreover, many of these technologies are in the early stage of development and may not prove economically and technically feasible or be accepted by regulators, and the applicable activities and projects may not be completed. If any of these circumstances occurs, we may not receive an adequate or any return on our investment in these activities and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\nOur businesses depend on recruiting, developing and retaining qualified personnel. Several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, which are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. At December 31, 2024, employees covered under collective bargaining agreements were 38%, 30% and 55%, respectively, of Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ workforce, of which the collective bargaining agreements covering 29%, 0% and 55% of employees, respectively, expire within one year (and in the case of SoCalGas, the collective bargaining agreement expired in February 2025). Any prolonged negotiation or failure to reach an agreement on these labor contracts as they are up for renewal could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions. For SoCalGas, negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement are presently ongoing. Until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by employees, there could be labor disruptions. Additionally, we have faced a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel in certain specialty operational positions and could experience disruptions from recruiting or retention challenges for personnel in those positions. Any labor disruption, negotiated wage or benefit increases or other challenges, whether due to union activities, employee turnover, labor shortages or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOur businesses depend on the performance of counterparties.\n\nOur businesses depend on the performance of business partners, customers, suppliers, contractors, and other counterparties under contractual and other arrangements to provide, among other things, services, equipment, or commodities. If they fail to perform their obligations in accordance with these arrangements or elect to exercise their early termination rights, we may be unable to meet our obligations and may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or honor our underlying commitments at then-current market prices, which may result in losses or delays or other operational disruptions. Any efforts to enforce the terms of these arrangements through legal or other means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and subject to failure. In addition, many of these arrangements and relationships with counterparties are important for the development, construction and operation of our projects and growth of our businesses. We also may not be able to secure replacement agreements with other counterparties on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all if any of these arrangements terminate. Further, we often face counterparty credit risk with respect to customers, suppliers, and other counterparties and, although we perform credit analyses prior to extending credit or entering into transactions with such counterparties, we may not be able to collect the amounts owed to us, which could be significant and present an increased risk for our long-term supply, sales and capacity contracts. Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on our counterparties and their ability to meet their obligations. Sempra Infrastructure also faces risks related to doing business with PEMEX and the CFE, which are Mexican state-owned enterprises, including their financial solvency and regulation by the Mexican government and the risk that they fail to meet their respective contractual obligations, among others. Any delay or default in payment of our counterparties’ financial obligations could result in our recording of a provision for credit losses on past due receivable balances and lower revenues, as was the case in 2023 and 2024 for a customer at Sempra Infrastructure. The failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn addition, Sempra Infrastructure’s ECA Regas Facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties and also enters into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. Cameron LNG JV has long-term liquefaction and regasification tolling agreements with three counterparties that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, and long-term sale and purchase agreements are in place for the expected capacity at the ECA LNG Phase 1 and PA LNG Phase 1 projects under construction. The long-term nature of these agreements and the small number of customers at each of these facilities exposes us to risks, including increased risk if these counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, increased credit risks, and risks associated with our relationships with these counterparties, including increased impacts of disputes or other similar \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  43\n\n\nissues which we have experienced in the past. Any such issues that arise in the future with respect to our long-term contracts could lead to significant legal and other costs, result in cancelation of certain key contracts or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with long-term customers, suppliers or partners, and could negatively impact the reliability of revenues from the applicable projects and the prospects for any implicated development projects. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. \n\nSempra Infrastructure’s obligations and those of its counterparties, such as its LNG customers, are contractually subject to suspension or termination for force majeure events, which generally are beyond the control of the parties. Force majeure declarations may also have attendant negative consequences, or loss or deferral of revenue arising from non-deliveries of natural gas from suppliers or LNG to customers in certain circumstances. Also, certain force majeure events may impact the contractors constructing Sempra Infrastructure’s projects, which may result in delays or increased costs. Sempra Infrastructure may have limited remedies available for certain failures to perform, including limitations on damages that may prohibit recovery of costs incurred for any breach of an agreement. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure engages in JVs and invests in companies in which other equity partners have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment. Sempra Texas also invests in companies it does not control or manage. We discuss the risks related to such arrangements above under “Risks Related to Sempra – Operational and Structural Risks.”\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOur debt service obligations expose us to risks and could require additional equity securities issuances by Sempra or sales of equity interests in subsidiaries or projects under development.\n\nWe have significant debt service obligations and an ongoing need for significant amounts of additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects by, among other things:\n\n▪making it more difficult and costly to service, pay or refinance debts as they come due, particularly when interest rates increase or economic or industry conditions are otherwise unfavorable\n\n▪limiting flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to business developments or industry changes\n\n▪causing lenders to require materially adverse terms for new debt, such as restrictions on uses of proceeds, limitations on incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing stock, or receiving distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments and the creation of liens \n\nIn January 2025, S&P revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A. Sempra aims to maintain or improve its credit ratings, but we may not be able to do so. To maintain these credit ratings, we may seek to reduce our outstanding indebtedness or our need for additional indebtedness by reducing or postponing discretionary, non-safety related capital expenditures or investments in new businesses. Additionally, we may issue equity securities, including in our ATM program (such as our November 2024 forward sale agreement under the ATM program for the sale of 2,909,274 shares), or sell equity interests in our subsidiaries or development projects. We may not be able to complete any such equity sales on acceptable terms or at all, and any new equity issued by Sempra may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of Sempra’s existing equity holders. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nThe availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be negatively affected by market and economic conditions and other factors.\n\nOur businesses are capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods. In general, we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay or refinance outstanding debt, and we rely on short-term debt to fund a significant portion of day-to-day operations. Sempra has also raised and may continue to seek capital by issuing equity, including in our ATM program, or selling equity interests in our subsidiaries or investments.\n\nLimitations on the availability of credit, increases in interest rates or credit spreads due to inflation or otherwise or other negative effects on the terms of any financing we pursue could cause us to fund operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or fail to raise our targeted amount of funds, which could negatively impact our ability to meet contractual and other commitments, progress development projects, make non-safety related capital expenditures and effectively sustain operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn addition to market and economic conditions, factors that can affect the availability and cost of capital include:\n\n▪adverse changes to laws and regulations, including recent and proposed changes to energy market regulation in Mexico\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  44\n\n\n▪for Sempra and SDG&E, risks related to California wildfires \n\n▪for Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, any deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California\n\n▪credit ratings downgrades, such as S&P’s January 2025 actions that revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A.\n\nCredit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place them on negative outlook.\n\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas, SI Partners and certain of our other businesses whose ratings are based on several factors, including the factors described below and, generally, the ability to generate cash flows; terms and levels of indebtedness, including the credit rating agencies’ treatment of certain types of indebtedness, such as subordinated indebtedness which is given partial equity credit but carries a higher interest rate than comparable senior indebtedness; overall financial strength; specific transactions or events, such as share repurchases and significant litigation; the status of certain capital projects, including our LNG projects; and general economic and industry conditions. These credit ratings could be downgraded or subject to other negative rating actions at any time, such as S&P’s January 2025 actions that revised Sempra’s outlook to negative from stable and downgraded SoCalGas’ issuer credit rating to A- from A. We discuss these credit ratings in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity.”\n\nFor Sempra, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪expansion of natural gas liquefaction projects or other unregulated businesses in a manner inconsistent with its present level of credit quality \n\n▪the PA LNG Phase 1 project experiences higher construction costs\n\n▪Sempra’s consolidated financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund earlier than expected\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at SDG&E, SoCalGas, Oncor and/or SI Partners\n\nFor SDG&E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund earlier than expected\n\n▪a consistent weakening of SDG&E’s financial metrics, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪a deterioration in the regulatory environment, including credit negative outcomes of its pending regulatory proceedings\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra\n\nFor SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪SoCalGas’ financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪SoCalGas experiences increased business risk due to a deterioration in the regulatory environment, including credit negative outcomes of its pending regulatory proceedings or elevated risk concerning its natural gas utility business\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra\n\nFor SI Partners, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\n▪SI Partners’ failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\n▪a deterioration in SI Partners’ business risk profile, including incremental construction risk or adverse changes in the operating environment in Mexico\n\n▪the PA LNG Phase 1 project experiences challenges or delays in construction that have an adverse financial impact on SI Partners\n\n▪a ratings downgrade at Sempra, IEnova, Cameron LNG, LLC and/or Port Arthur LNG, LLC\n\nA downgrade of any of our businesses’ credit ratings or ratings outlooks, as well as the reasons for such downgrades, could materially adversely affect the interest rates at which borrowings can be made and debt securities issued and the various fees on our credit facilities. This could make it more costly to borrow money, issue securities and/or raise other types of capital, any of which could reduce our ability to meet our debt obligations and contractual commitments and, in the case of SDG&E and SoCalGas, increase customer rates, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  45\n\n\nWe do not fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices or interest rates, and for positions that are hedged, our hedging mechanisms may not mitigate our risk or reduce our losses as intended.\n\nWe use forward contracts, futures, financial swaps and/or options, among other mechanisms, to hedge a portion of our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity in an effort to reduce our, and for SDG&E and SoCalGas, customers’ financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we have used and may continue to use similar financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates. The extent to which we hedge our positions varies over time. Certain derivative instruments are recorded at fair value through earnings to reflect movements in the price of the derivative, which has recently and could in the future create volatility in our earnings. The effect of such commodity derivative instruments for SDG&E and SoCalGas are passed through to customers in rates without markup. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if any hedging counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations or if our hedging strategies do not work as intended, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRisk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses.\n\nAlthough we have risk management and control systems designed to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or function as expected. In addition, daily VaR and loss limits, which are primarily based on historic price movements and which we discuss in “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” may not protect us from losses if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices. As a result of these and other factors, our risk management procedures and systems may not prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could result in a material charge to earnings.\n\nWe test long-lived assets, including equity method investments, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may affect the recoverability or the estimated useful lives of the assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances necessitate a valuation. We could experience such an event or change in circumstances from, among other things, (i) an inability to operate our existing facilities, (ii) an inability to collect from customers, (iii) changes to laws or regulations or other circumstances affecting the energy sector or our assets in Mexico, (iv) adverse rulings in lawsuits, binding arbitrations, regulatory proceedings, audits and other proceedings materially impacting our businesses, including our equity method investments such as Oncor Holdings and Cameron LNG JV, and (v) more generally any loss of permits or approvals that requires us to adjust or cease certain operations and any failure to complete or receive an adequate return on our investments in capital projects. A material charge to earnings from an impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require unplanned contributions to pension and PBOP plans.\n\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension and PBOP plans to eligible employees and retirees. The cost of providing these benefits is affected by many factors, including the market value of plan assets and the other factors described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity.” A decline in the market value of plan assets or an adverse change in any of these other factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations for these plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  46\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe face risks related to failures and delays in obtaining and maintaining permits, licenses, franchises and other approvals required by our businesses.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation, and our businesses require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchises, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These approvals may not be granted in a timely manner (including due to potential staffing issues at U.S. regulatory agencies) or at all or may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended for a variety of reasons, including due to legal or regulatory changes or political considerations. The City of San Diego is studying the feasibility of municipalization as a potential alternative to SDG&E’s existing electric franchise agreement, and various aspects of SDG&E’s natural gas and electric franchise agreements have also been challenged in two lawsuits that we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At Sempra Infrastructure, amendments to Mexico’s Constitution and to Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law have the potential to increase government control and participation in the energy sector and may require the CRE to revoke Sempra Infrastructure’s self-supply permits deemed improperly obtained under a legal standard that is ambiguous and not well defined under the law. Obtaining or maintaining required approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on our operations. Further, noncompliance by us or certain of our customers with the terms of these approvals could result in their modification, suspension or rescission and subject us to lost revenue, fines and penalties. If any of these approvals are suspended, rescinded or otherwise terminated or modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise impracticable, we may be required to adjust or temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations, sell the associated assets or remove them from service and/or construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, in which case we may lose some of our rate base or revenue-generating assets, our development projects may be negatively affected and we may incur impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFrom time to time, we invest funds in projects prior to receiving all regulatory approvals. We may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in such projects if: \n\n▪there is a delay in obtaining these approvals \n\n▪any approval is conditioned on changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations \n\n▪we fail to obtain or maintain these approvals or comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations \n\n▪we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any approval or rights to the applicable property or assets \n\n▪management decides not to proceed with a project \n\nOur inability to recover funds invested in these projects could materially increase our costs, result in material impairments, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to environmental and climate change regulation and the costs of the energy transition. \n\nThe impacts from the mitigation of climate change and related regulations may increase the costs we incur to procure and transmit energy and provide other services. The changes in costs and preferences for lower carbon and renewable energy sources may impact the demand for, consumption of, and type of energy we transmit and distribute. \n\nEnvironmental and Climate Change Regulation\n\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, regional, local and foreign statutes, orders, rules and regulations relating to climate change and environmental protection. To comply with these requirements, we must expend significant capital and employee resources on environmental monitoring, surveillance and other measures to track performance; acquisition and installation of pollution control equipment; mitigation efforts; and emissions fees, which could increase as a result of various factors we may not control, including changing laws and regulations, increased readiness and enforcement activities, delays in the renewal and issuance of permits, and changes to the mix of energy we transmit and distribute. In addition, we are generally responsible for hazardous substances and other contamination on and the conditions of our projects and properties, regardless of when these conditions arose and whether they are known or unknown. We have been and may in the future be required to pay environmental remediation costs at former facilities and off-site waste disposal sites where any of our businesses is identified as a PRP under federal, state and local environmental laws. For our regulated utilities, some or all of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and/or curtailment of our operations. Moreover, increasing international, national, regional, state and local environmental concerns and related changes to applicable legal and regulatory frameworks, such as requirements for increased monitoring and surveillance, disclosures on environmental performance, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  47\n\n\npractices, emissions fees, taxes, penalties or other obligations or restrictions, may have material negative effects on our operations, costs, corporate planning, and the scope and economics of proposed infrastructure projects or other capital expenditures. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nIn particular, legislation and regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change are proliferating, as we discuss in “Part I — Item 1. Environmental Matters.” California’s goals are facing cost pressures and may experience delays or other challenges that could cause the state to modify its laws and rules, resulting in significant uncertainty. These or other similar laws and rules may materially restrict our operations, negatively impact demand for our services and/or the energy we transmit and distribute, limit development opportunities, force costly or otherwise burdensome changes to our operations, negatively impact customer affordability, or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC’s final rules on climate-related disclosures and California laws requiring expansive disclosures on GHG emissions and other environmental measures, targets and claims could subject us to liability for these disclosures as well as significant compliance costs and could have other consequences that may be difficult to predict, including negative sentiment from current and potential investors, regulators or other groups. These new disclosure requirements may use different reporting frameworks and methodologies, such as reporting boundaries, which may further increase compliance costs and the risk of compliance failures and may create confusion for stakeholders. Moreover, these disclosure requirements could increase the risk that we become subject to climate change lawsuits. Defense costs associated with such litigation could be significant, and any adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures or payment of substantial penalties or damages. Although these new disclosure requirements are subject to challenges in pending lawsuits and may change as a result of further agency action, any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOther Energy Transition Risks\n\nThe energy transition in California and elsewhere, including decarbonization goals, has introduced uncertainty in long-term investor support, leading some to reduce investment in or divest from our sector. Maintaining investor confidence and attracting capital at a competitive cost will depend, in part, on demonstrating our ability to address material business risks related to climate and our efforts to help achieve the goals of our consumers and the markets and jurisdictions where we operate. In an effort to maintain a sustainable and durable business risk profile and continue to focus on value creation, Sempra has evaluated and updated its climate aspirations to reflect the changing policy, regulatory, commercial and technological landscape, including stakeholders’ evolving focus on reliability, resiliency and affordability and the pace and impact of climate and other public policies. Following this evaluation, Sempra now aims to have net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050, with an interim target of 50% scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reductions by 2035 (this interim target applies to Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure’s Mexico (non-LNG) operations and is relative to a 2019 baseline). While the company no longer has a specific goal to achieve net-zero scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050, the capabilities we are developing through our energy transition action plan could also support the reduction of scope 3 GHG emissions and help meet regulatory, consumer and market demand for lower- and zero-carbon energy. Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ abilities to advance their respective net-zero and other climate objectives will depend on many factors, some of which we do not control, including supportive federal and state energy laws, policies, incentives, tax credits and regulatory decisions; cost and affordability considerations; development, commercialization and regulatory acceptance of alternative and lower-carbon energy sources, including cleaner fuels; successful research and development efforts focused on lower carbon technologies that are economically and technically feasible; cooperation from our partners, financing sources and commercial counterparties; customer participation in conservation and energy efficiency programs; our ability to execute our planned investments in our infrastructure; and consumers’ decisions and preferences. In addition, forecasting to 2035, 2045 and 2050 is inherently speculative without knowing the trajectory of the energy transition. As a result, although we are dedicated to progress on our climate aims and are continuing to develop capabilities designed to reduce GHG emissions from our own operations as well as to support consumers’ and markets’ own climate goals, we may not be successful in achieving these objectives.\n\nWe will need to continue to expend capital and employee resources to develop and deploy new technologies and modernize grid systems to meet the demand for lower carbon and reliable energy in California and elsewhere and achieve our climate aspirations and those mandated by applicable authorities, which may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may not be able to be passed through to customers. Even if such costs are recoverable, these costs, coupled with necessary safety and reliability investments, may negatively impact the affordability of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and, for our businesses that are not regulated utilities, may cause costs to increase to levels that reduce customer demand and growth. SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as any of our other businesses affected by GHG emissions reduction and mitigation and renewable energy mandates, may also be subject to fines and penalties if mandated goals are not met, and all our businesses could suffer difficulties attracting investors and business partners, reputational harm and other negative effects if we do not meet or if \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  48\n\n\nwe further modify our GHG emissions reduction aims or there are negative views about our environmental disclosures or practices generally. \n\nWe develop our capital expenditure plans based on forecasts as well as regulatory and compliance requirements, including those related to safety, reliability and load growth, gas system planning, and transportation electrification, which generally assume that California will continue to pursue consistent environmental and climate-related policies. If the federal government withdraws its support for grid and infrastructure modernization or prohibits California from pursuing its environmental and climate-related policies, or if California changes its policies, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be unable to meet their respective aims.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe are subject to complex tax and accounting requirements that expose us to risks.\n\nWe are subject to complex tax and accounting requirements. These requirements may undergo changes at the federal, state, local and foreign levels, including in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements, including changes to them or how they are implemented, interpreted or enforced, could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect how we conduct our business. New tax legislation, regulations or interpretations or changes in tax policies in the U.S., Mexico or other countries in which we operate or do business could negatively affect our tax expense and/or tax balances and our businesses generally. Any failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe may be negatively impacted by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved.\n\nOur businesses are involved in a number of lawsuits, appeals, binding arbitrations, regulatory investigations and other proceedings. We discuss material pending proceedings in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our businesses also may become involved in new proceedings that we do not consider material, such as the approximately 28,000 proofs of claim that have been filed on behalf of persons who assert the right to file lawsuits in the future based on alleged exposure to asbestos in power plants designed and/or built by certain predecessor entities we acquired in connection with our acquisition of our majority interest in Oncor. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial money, time and employee and management focus on lawsuits and other proceedings. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits and other proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing, costs and ranges of costs or outcome of these matters, and changes or disruptions to the judicial system, such as the nationwide strike by the Mexican judiciary in 2024 in response to recent Mexican Constitutional reforms that require all judges to be elected rather than appointed, could result in delays, increased costs, or unfavorable outcomes. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in response to personal injury, product liability, property damage, nuisance, and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred have and may continue to differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, from insurance or in customer rates. Any of the foregoing could cause reputational damage and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA CALIFORNIA\n\nOperational Risks\n\nWildfires in California pose risks to Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas.\n\nMore and Increasingly Severe Wildfires\n\nIn recent years, California has experienced some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned and/or structures destroyed) in its history. Frequent and severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, low humidity, strong winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity, prevalence and difficulty of prevention and containment of wildfires in California, including in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could exacerbate these conditions. Certain of California’s local land use policies and forestry management practices have allowed for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses related to fires for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable. The LA Fires damaged some of SoCalGas’ natural gas infrastructure and significant third-party property and resulted in service disruptions in some of its service territory. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  49\n\n\nFuture wildfires in SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ service territories could compromise SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ electric and natural gas infrastructure and result in further service disruptions. Any such wildfires in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ territories (or outside of SDG&E’s territory in the event the Wildfire Fund is materially diminished) could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which we discuss further in this risk factor below and above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks.” \n\nThe Wildfire Legislation \n\nIn July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law, which we discuss in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Wildfire Legislation’s legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently, we may not be eligible for the Wildfire Legislation’s cap on wildfire-related liability if SDG&E fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the OEIS or meet other requirements, and/or the Wildfire Fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by SDG&E or other participating IOUs as a result of fires in their respective service territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s and SDG&E’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. PG&E is seeking reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie Fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021. In addition, fires of the size and scope of the recent LA Fires, if found to have been caused by a participating IOU, could have a material adverse effect on the Wildfire Fund. In the case of the LA fires, the causes of these fires have not been determined and therefore these fires may not impact the Wildfire Fund. \n\nIn addition, the Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including business interruption losses, interest and attorneys’ fees, even if the utility is not found negligent. In the past, the CPUC has denied recovery of incurred costs associated with wildfire claims despite the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which was historically based on the ability of a utility to pass such costs through to rate payers. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, such as negligence, under which additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. We are unable to predict the impact of the Wildfire Legislation on SDG&E’s ability to recover costs and expenses if SDG&E’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation.\n\nCost Recovery Through Insurance or Rates\n\nAs a result of California’s doctrine of inverse condemnation, substantial losses recorded by insurance companies, and increased wildfire risk, obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires potentially associated with SDG&E’s equipment (or, to a lesser extent, SoCalGas) has become increasingly difficult and costly. If these conditions continue or worsen, including as a result of the LA Fires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be denied recovery of insurance cost increases through the regulatory process. In addition, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur, or it may not be available to meet the $1.0 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. Wildfire insurance may also become prohibitively expensive or unavailable for homeowners and businesses in SDG&E’s service territory, potentially increasing SDG&E’s financial exposure if a wildfire is found to be caused by SDG&E’s equipment. We are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the amount of any uninsured losses. A loss that is not fully insured, is not sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect Sempra’s and one or both of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWildfire Mitigation Efforts\n\nAlthough we expend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfire-related losses, and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. SDG&E is required by California law to submit wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the OEIS and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner or SDG&E is determined to not have substantially complied with its approved plans, including the risk of fines or penalties for noncompliance. One of our wildfire mitigation strategies is to de-energize certain circuits for safety when there is elevated weather-related wildfire ignition risk. These “public safety power shutoffs” have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and lawmakers, which could increase the risk of liability for damages associated with these events if SDG&E is found not to have acted within applicable guidelines and regulations. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, stakeholder scrutiny, ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  50\n\n\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of renewable energy sources and energy storage, technological advancements, evolving procurement service standards, and political and regulatory developments. \n\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of solar and wind generation, including DER, energy storage and energy efficiency and demand management technologies, and California’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes. This growth will require further modernization of the electric grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, attaining California’s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in transmission and distribution grid modernization, renewable energy integration projects, energy efficiency programs, operational and data management systems, and electric vehicle and energy storage infrastructure, which may increase exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. The growth of third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies also may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. Certain FERC transmission development projects are open to competition, allowing independent developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities. The CPUC is conducting various proceedings regarding DER, including the evaluation of special programs and pilot projects; changes to the planning and operation of the electric grid to prepare for higher penetration of DER; future grid modernization investments; the deferral of traditional grid investments by DER; and the role of the electric grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California’s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nMost of SDG&E’s customers receive electric procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. CCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program, as is the case with the City of San Diego and certain other jurisdictions in SDG&E’s service territory, and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. As a result of customers electing CCA and DA services, SDG&E’s historical energy procurement commitments for future deliveries exceed the needs of its remaining bundled customers. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether customers’ energy is procured by SDG&E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The framework is intended to more equitably allocate SDG&E’s procurement cost obligations among customers served by SDG&E and customers now served by CCA and DA. If the framework or other mechanisms designed to achieve ratepayer indifference do not perform as intended, if the law changes, or if the law is not interpreted or enforced as expected, SDG&E’s remaining bundled customers could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA and DA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG&E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nNatural gas continues to be the subject of political and public debate, including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source. \n\nCertain California legislators, regulators and other stakeholders have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source through increased use of renewable electricity and electrification. Reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain local, state and federal agencies, resulting in passed or proposed legislation, regulation, policies and ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use of natural gas in new buildings, appliances and other applications. These actions could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time, and the combination of reduced load and increasing costs to maintain the gas system could negatively impact affordability for remaining natural gas customers.\n\nIn February 2017, the CPUC opened proceeding SB 380 OII relating to SoCalGas to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including analyzing alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated. In December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the SB 380 OII finding that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is currently necessary for natural gas and electric reliability and affordable rates and closed the OII. Among other things, and subject to future CPUC biennial reviews and potential additional proceedings, the FD authorizes the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to continue operating and sets the maximum working natural gas storage level at 68.6 bcf. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we would record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, we could incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss proceeding SB 380 OII in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  51\n\n\nCARB, California’s primary regulator for GHG emissions reduction programs, is evaluating various options for reducing natural gas demand through building decarbonization measures and is considering a proposed statewide zero-emissions standard for space and water heaters. Additionally, the CEC adopted changes to the Title 24 California Building Standards Code that require newly constructed residential and commercial buildings to include heat pump technologies for space and water heating beginning in 2026. \n\nThe CPUC has an open proceeding to establish policies, processes, and rules governing safe and reliable gas system operation and long-term gas system infrastructure planning for natural gas utilities in alignment with California’s decarbonization goals. Potential outcomes include reductions in natural gas demand over time in favor of electrification, renewable energy alternatives, and/or cleaner fuels and changes to rate and cost recovery policies. \n\nA substantial reduction in or the elimination of natural gas use in California without adequate recovery of investments could result in impairment of some or all of SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, were required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or were to become stranded, which could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’, SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial conditions, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSDG&E may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned. \n\nSDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, which we discuss in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG&E and each of the other owners of SONGS is responsible for financing its share of the facility’s expenses and capital expenditures, including those related to decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E’s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to risks, including:\n\n▪the potential release of radioactive material\n\n▪the potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility\n\n▪limitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility\n\n▪uncertainties with respect to the technological, financial, and political aspects of decommissioning the facility and the long-term storage of radioactive materials\n\nSDG&E maintains the SONGS NDT to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning. Trust assets generally have been invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment due to inflationary pressures or otherwise could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, CPUC approval is required to make withdrawals from the NDT, and CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the CPUC determines the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the NDT. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur. \n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are subject to extensive regulation.\n\nRates and Other Financial Matters\n\nThe CPUC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates, except for SDG&E’s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the FERC, and conditions of service. The CPUC also regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, long-term resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings. The CPUC periodically approves SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework, as well as certain settlements with third parties and mandatory social programs. The timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; any rejection by the CPUC of settlements with third parties; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of regulators, customers and other stakeholders. \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  52\n\n\nThese ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SDG&E and SoCalGas make investments under an approved CPUC framework, such as wildfire mitigation and pipeline and storage integrity and safety enhancement programs, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC filing or reasonableness review that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs. SDG&E and SoCalGas also may be required to make investments and incur other costs to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those related to California’s climate goals and policies, and the ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the corresponding ratemaking mechanisms. Recovery may be delayed and/or insufficient if the applicable ratemaking mechanism involves a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in rates or if there are material differences between the authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the actual costs incurred. Delays may also result from the administrative process, or the CPUC may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons, such as customer affordability. Even if recoverable, simultaneously investing in support of necessary safety and reliability and the regulatory requirements and demand for reliable lower-carbon energy may negatively impact the affordability of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates and their and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base. The CCM applies in the interim years and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (CCM benchmark rate) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole. In October 2024, the CPUC issued an FD to modify the CCM. The FD updates the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, from 50% to 20% of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period. Any further rate changes due to a downward trigger of the CCM or the denial by the CPUC of an automatic upward trigger of the CCM could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s and the applicable utility’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss the CCM in “Part I – Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms – Sempra California – Cost of Capital Proceedings,” and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC ratemaking proceedings. In particular, SDG&E’s authorized TO5 settlement provided for an ROE of 10.60%, consisting of a base ROE of 10.10% plus the California ISO adder. In December 2024, the FERC issued an order, which SDG&E has appealed, finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the California ISO adder and that the TO5 adder refund provision has been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019. In October 2024, SDG&E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC, requested to be effective January 1, 2025, and subject to refund. SDG&E’s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG&E’s currently authorized base ROE from 10.10% to 11.75% plus the California ISO adder, for a total ROE of 12.25%. In December 2024, the FERC accepted SDG&E’s TO6 filing but suspended the effective date to June 1, 2025 and disallowed the inclusion of the California ISO adder, which SDG&E has appealed. Any unfavorable outcome in these proceedings, such as the discontinuation of the California ISO adder or not being successful in our appeal of the FERC decision finding that the TO5 adder refund provision was triggered, could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nCPUC Authority Over Operational Matters\n\nOur operations are subject to CPUC rules (and similar FERC rules), commonly referred to as “affiliate rules,” relating to transactions among SDG&E, SoCalGas and other Sempra businesses. These rules primarily impact market transactions and marketing activities involving transmission supply and capacity, including sales or other trades of natural gas or electricity within or among SDG&E and SoCalGas and Sempra and its covered affiliates. Noncompliance with these rules, as well as any changes to these rules or their interpretations or additional more restrictive CPUC or FERC rules related to transactions with affiliates, could materially adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nAdditionally, the CPUC has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, reliability and planning, competitive conditions and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation and enforcement programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. Many of these standards and citation and enforcement programs are becoming more stringent and could subject a utility to significant penalties and fines, as well as higher operating costs. The CPUC conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and may launch \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  53\n\n\ninvestigations or open proceedings at its discretion, the results of which could include citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions to address any noncompliance, any of which may not be sufficiently funded by customer rates or at all. Any such occurrence could result in other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to SDG&E and SoCalGas in Notes 4 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRegulatory Changes and Influence of Other Organizations\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas incur significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with regulatory compliance. SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how SDG&E and SoCalGas operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, require them to incur additional expenses and compliance costs or otherwise materially adversely affect their and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups, including California Public Advocates Office, The Utility Reform Network, Utility Consumers’ Action Network and the Sierra Club. Success by any of these groups in directly or indirectly influencing legislators and regulators could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak.\n\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we describe in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve approximately 390 lawsuits including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) then pending against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak for a payment of up to $1.8 billion. Over 99% of the Individual Plaintiffs participated and submitted valid releases, and SoCalGas paid $1.79 billion in 2022 under the agreement. The Individual Plaintiffs who did not participate in the settlement (the Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs) are able to continue to pursue their claims. As of February 19, 2025, there are approximately 520 plaintiffs who are either new plaintiffs that have filed new lawsuits related to the Leak or Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs. This litigation seeks compensatory and punitive damages, property damage and diminution in property value, injunctive relief and civil penalties. Additional litigation may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses to it. The costs of defending against, settling or otherwise resolving the pending lawsuits or any new litigation could materially adversely affect SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss the risks associated with litigation above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Legal and Regulatory Risks.”\n\nSoCalGas’ loss contingency accruals do not include any amounts in excess of what has been reasonably estimated to resolve these matters, nor any amounts that may be necessary to resolve threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs. We are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFailure by the CPUC to adequately reform SDG&E’s electric rate structure could negatively impact SDG&E and Sempra.\n\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable energy generation (primarily solar installations) for residential and business customers. Depending on when the on-site generation is installed, NEM customers receive a full retail rate or a reduced retail rate for energy they generate but do not use that is fed to the utility’s power grid, which results in these customers not paying their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, but still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. As more and higher electric-use customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on remaining non-NEM customers, who effectively subsidize the unpaid NEM costs, increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation and further increases rate pressure on remaining non-NEM customers.\n\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower-use customers. In December 2023, a new Net Billing Tariff \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  54\n\n\nwas implemented for customers who interconnect their qualifying on-site renewable energy generation after April 2023. The new Net Billing Tariff revised the NEM structure for new customers with a retail export compensation rate that is better aligned with the value provided to the grid by behind-the-meter energy generation systems and retail import rates that encourage electrification and adoption of solar systems paired with storage. The new Net Billing Tariff is designed to compensate customers for the value of their exports to the grid based on avoided cost. Additionally, in response to California legislation adopted in 2022, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to broadly restructure the way fixed costs are collected, moving away from volumetric only charges and incorporating an income-graduated fixed charge for default residential rates. The intent of such a fixed charge is to establish a rate structure that allows the utility to collect a greater portion of its fixed costs on a non-volumetric basis, advance the state’s climate goals through end-use electrification and provide a more affordable rate design on average for lower-income customers. In May 2024, the CPUC adopted a residential fixed charge with implementation expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Depending on the effectiveness of the new Net Billing Tariff and fixed charge, which are uncertain, the risks associated with the existing NEM tariff and rate design, including adverse impacts on electricity rates and the reliability of the transmission and distribution system and the potential for increased customer dissatisfaction, increased likelihood of noncompliance with CPUC or other safety or operational standards, and increased power procurement, operating, capital and other costs that may not be recoverable, could continue or increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA TEXAS UTILITIES\n\nOperational and Structural Risks\n\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management, operations and policies of Oncor.\n\nVarious “ring-fencing” measures, governance mechanisms and commitments are in place that create legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand. These measures are designed to enhance Oncor’s separateness from its owners and mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted by a bankruptcy or other adverse financial development affecting its owners. These measures subject us and Oncor to various restrictions, including:\n\n▪seven members of Oncor’s 13-person board of directors must be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the NYSE in relation to Sempra and its affiliates and any other owners of Oncor, and also must have no material relationship with Sempra or its affiliates or any other owners of Oncor currently or within the previous 10 years; of the six remaining directors, two must be designated by Sempra, two must be designated by Oncor’s minority owner, TTI, and two must be current or former Oncor officers\n\n▪Oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if (i) a majority of Oncor’s independent directors or any of the directors appointed by TTI determines that it is in the best interest of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements, (ii) the payment would cause Oncor’s debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT, or (iii) unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT, Oncor’s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody’s)\n\n▪there must be certain “separateness measures” maintained to reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor from Sempra, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra or Sempra’s affiliates (other than Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries) must be on an arm’s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or membership interests for any entity other than Oncor \n\n▪a majority of Oncor’s independent directors and the directors designated by TTI that are present and voting (with at least one required to be present and voting) must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in the budget differs by more than 10% from the corresponding amounts in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable\n\nAs a result of these measures, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, operations and policies of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends or other distributions, strategic planning and other important matters. Moreover, all directors of Oncor, including the directors we have appointed, have considerable autonomy and have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may in some cases be contrary to our interests. To the extent the directors approve or Oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interest, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  55\n\n\nIndustry-Related Risks\n\nChanges in the regulation of Oncor or the regulation or operation of the electric utility industry and/or the ERCOT market could negatively affect Oncor.\n\nOncor operates in the electric utility industry and is subject to many of the same or similar risks as SDG&E and SoCalGas as we describe above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses” and “Risks Related to Sempra California,” particularly with respect to our operational risks, financial risks and specifically regulation by federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory authorities regarding rates and other financial and operational matters. Oncor operates in the ERCOT market. In ERCOT, rates are set by the PUCT based on a historical test year, and as a result, the rates Oncor is allowed to charge generally will not exactly match its costs at any given point in time and there is no assurance that it will be able to timely or fully recover its actual costs and/or earn its full return on invested capital, particularly during periods of increased capital spending by Oncor, high inflation, or increases in general interest rates relative to Oncor’s most recent base rate review. Further, the approved levels of recovery could be significantly less than requested levels, and the approved timing for recovery could differ from proposed timelines. In addition to requests to recover its costs, Oncor’s rate proceedings may contain other requests. Failure to receive approval of its requests in any rate proceeding could adversely impact Oncor, which could adversely impact us, and those impacts could be material. \n\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with the various legislative and regulatory requirements to which Oncor is subject at the federal, state, and local levels and adjusting Oncor’s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in ERCOT, and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance, may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. In addition, insufficient electric capacity within ERCOT or significant changes within ERCOT or to the ERCOT market structure that impact transmission and distribution utilities, including adverse publicity or public perception, additional regulatory requirements or oversight, could materially adversely affect Oncor. Moreover, legislative, regulatory, market or industry activities could adversely impact Oncor’s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings. For instance, the PUCT has instituted various projects reviewing the regulatory framework regarding DER and other non-traditional technologies. As DER usage continues to grow, related regulatory decisions, including with respect to ERCOT market rules and transmission and distribution utilities’ ability to invest in non-traditional electricity delivery solutions, could adversely impact Oncor’s revenues and operations. Additionally, projected load growth across the ERCOT system could, if not sufficiently addressed through system design and reliability measures, negatively impact electric infrastructure reliability and potentially cause system-wide stresses. If Oncor does not successfully respond to applicable legislative, regulatory, market or industry developments, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOncor could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments.\n\nOncor’s business is capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available at reasonable prices or on other reasonable terms in the future, or at all. Because our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor, we may elect to make capital contributions to Oncor if it fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital from other sources to finance its ongoing needs. Any such investments could be substantial, would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, may not be recovered, and could increase our indebtedness, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH’s 2016 spin-off of Vistra is deemed to be taxable.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Corp. (formerly Vistra Energy Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra’s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\n\nIn connection with the merger of EFH with a subsidiary of Sempra (the Merger), EFH received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  56\n\n\nMerger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra and EFH. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce the value associated with our investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOperational Risks\n\nProject development activities may not be successful, projects under construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget, and completed projects may not operate at expected levels or generate expected earnings or cash flows.\n\nEnergy Infrastructure Projects\n\nWe are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects in various stages of development and construction, which subject us to numerous risks. Success in developing each project depends on, among other things:\n\n▪our financial condition and cash flows and other factors that impact our ability to invest sufficient funds in the project, including for preliminary activities conducted before we determine whether the project is feasible or economically attractive \n\n▪project assessment and design and our ability to foresee and incorporate new and developing trends and technologies in the energy industry, such as projects and design solutions to help enable our and our customers’ climate goals\n\n▪our ability to reach a final investment decision or meet other milestones, which may be influenced by external factors outside our control, including the global economy and energy and financial markets, actions by regulators, achieving necessary internal and external approvals, and many of the other factors described in this risk factor\n\n▪negotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements and renegotiation in the event of delays in final investment decisions or failures to meet other specified deadlines \n\n▪identification of suitable partners, customers, contractors, suppliers and other necessary counterparties\n\n▪progressing relationships from MOUs, HOAs or similar arrangements, which are non-binding, to execution of binding, definitive agreements and participation in the project\n\n▪negotiation and maintenance of satisfactory equity, purchase, sale, supply, transportation and other appropriate commercial agreements, and satisfaction of any conditions to effectiveness of such agreements, including reaching a positive final investment decision within agreed timelines\n\n▪timely receipt and maintenance of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations under terms we find reasonable\n\n▪our project partners’, contractors’, equipment providers’ and other vendors’ and counterparties’ willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments or fulfill their contractual commitments on a timely basis\n\n▪timely, satisfactory and on-budget completion of construction, which could be negatively affected by engineering problems, work stoppages, unavailability or increased costs of materials, equipment, labor and commodities due to inflation or supply chain or other issues, and a variety of other factors, many of which we discuss above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks” and elsewhere in this risk factor\n\n▪implementation of new or changes to existing laws or regulations that impact our infrastructure or the energy sector generally\n\n▪obtaining satisfactory financing for the project, particularly when inflation and interest rates are volatile\n\n▪the absence of hidden defects on or inherited environmental liabilities for the site of the project\n\n▪timely and cost-effective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting the project\n\n▪geopolitical events and other uncertainties\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  57\n\n\nAny failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve additional costs, otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully complete the project and force us to impair or write off amounts we have invested in the project. If we are unable to complete a development project, if we experience delays, or if construction, financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions, we may not receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources expended on the project and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe operation of existing facilities and any future projects we complete involves many risks, including the potential for unforeseen design flaws, engineering challenges, or the breakdown for other reasons of facilities, equipment or processes; labor disputes or shortages; fuel interruption; environmental contamination; increasing regulatory requirements, including from regulations aiming to reduce GHG emissions; and the other operational risks that we discuss above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks.” Any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle or operating below expected levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nLNG Projects\n\nIn addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects, our LNG projects, which we discuss in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Capital Resources and Liquidity – Sempra Infrastructure,” also face distinct disadvantages relative to some LNG projects being pursued by other project developers, including:\n\n▪The proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the JV project financing agreements for the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and requires unanimous consent of all the members, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each member. We may not be able to satisfy the conditions under the financing agreements, receive members’ consent, obtain satisfactory conclusion on the EPC process, or obtain the extension of our non-FTA approval, in which case our ability to develop the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project would be jeopardized.\n\n▪The ECA LNG projects under construction and in development are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes and recent and proposed changes to the Mexican Constitution and certain laws in Mexico that could obstruct efforts to find or maintain suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements and hinder or halt construction and, if the projects are completed, operations. We discuss these risks under “Risks Related to Sempra Infrastructure – Legal and Regulatory Risks.” In addition, the Mexican regulatory process and overlay of U.S. regulation for natural gas exports to LNG facilities in Mexico are not well developed, which, among other factors, contributed to delays in obtaining a necessary permit from the Mexican government for the ECA LNG Phase 1 project and could cause similar delays or other hurdles in the future and lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements. Further, while we do not expect the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility, we expect construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility, which currently has firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell and SEFE that expire in May 2028 and December 2025, respectively. In addition, the Baja California region does not have extensive sources of natural gas, and at times, particularly during the summer, natural gas supply to the region is severely constrained and may impact our costs and our ability to source all feed gas required under our ECA LNG Phase 1 supply contracts. \n\n▪The PA LNG Phase 1 project under construction is located at a greenfield site and is therefore subject to certain disadvantages relative to other projects being constructed or developed at brownfield sites, such as increased time and costs to develop and construct the project due to lack of existing infrastructure. The PA LNG Phase 2 project in development would be located at the site of the PA LNG Phase 1 project and would therefore be subject to certain advantages, as well as potential disadvantages, relative to projects being developed at greenfield sites. Advantages of brownfield development include the ability to leverage existing permits and infrastructure; disadvantages of brownfield development could include increased complexity of integrating new facilities with existing infrastructure. Additionally, in February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the DOE to permit LNG produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project to be exported to all current and future non-FTA countries, which we may not receive on a timely basis or at all.\n\nDevelopment and operation of these or any other LNG projects will depend on the expansion of our existing pipeline interconnections or the ability to permit and construct new pipeline facilities, each of which may require us to enter into additional pipeline interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines, which may not be possible on reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe capital requirements for our LNG projects can be significant, even if we decide not to make a positive final investment decision. As has happened in the past, our proposed facilities may not be completed in accordance with estimated timelines or budgets or at all as a result of the above or other factors, and delays, cost overruns or our inability to complete one or more of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  58\n\n\nWe face risks from increased competition.\n\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous capable competitors, many of which have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience domestically and internationally and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. In particular, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments recently have been characterized by strong and increasing competition for winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe are exposed to additional competitive risks in connection with our LNG projects. Our ability to reach a final investment decision for each development project and, if a positive decision is made and a project is completed, the overall success of the project depends in part on global energy markets, which can increase competition for global LNG demand in a number of ways. In general, depressed natural gas and LNG prices in the markets intended to be served by any of our projects, including as a result of global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections or other factors, could reduce the pricing and cost advantages of exporting natural gas and LNG produced in North America, which could lead to decreased demand from our projects. Although demand for natural gas is currently strong due to increased focus on energy security and climate aims, a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, reduced economic activity in general, or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate global reliance on natural gas. Further, because LNG projects take a number of years to develop and construct, it is difficult to match current and expected demand with the projected supply from projects under development. Moreover, shifts in U.S. and foreign energy policy could impact supply, demand and other matters critical to LNG projects, such as permitting and other approval processes. Both the U.S. and Mexico held federal elections in 2024, and LNG exports may face increased costs under the new Administrations due to changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Also, the DOE has recently implemented changes to its approach to requests for extensions of time to commence LNG exports under existing non-FTA approvals. These changes and other market factors such as oil prices could delay or hamper the development of U.S. LNG export facilities and make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects in North America, thus increasing supply and competition for global LNG demand. Any of these occurrences could impact competition and prospects for developing LNG projects and negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe may not be able to secure, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply, sales or capacity agreements.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s ability to secure new or maintain, extend or replace existing long-term sales or capacity agreements for its natural gas pipeline operations depends on, among other factors, demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from its transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A decrease in demand for or supply of LNG or natural gas from such customers or the occurrence of other events that hinder Sempra Infrastructure from maintaining such agreements or establishing new ones could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built, supplies of energy and related products may exceed demand, competitive pressures may increase and wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile. Without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Infrastructure’s facilities can produce at favorable prices or at all, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity.\n\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to, among other things:\n\n▪deliver the natural gas, LNG, electricity and LPG we sell to customers or use for our LNG facilities \n\n▪supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities\n\n▪provide retail energy services to customers\n\nIf transportation is disrupted, the construction of necessary interconnecting infrastructure is not completed on schedule or at all or capacity is inadequate, we may be delayed in completing projects under development and/or unable to meet our contractual obligations to customers of those projects or existing projects, in which case we may be responsible for damages they incur, such as the cost of acquiring alternative supplies at then-current spot market rates, and we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  59\n\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s business is capital-intensive and relies on various types of financing arrangements, which may not be adequate or available in the future.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s business is capital-intensive, with significant and increasing capital spending expected in future periods. It relies on various types of financing to meet its capital requirements, including capital contributions from Sempra and NCI owners, as well as external financing such as loans and other forms of project financing that could impose guarantees, indemnities or other obligations. These arrangements could expose us to risks, including exposure to losses upon the occurrence of certain events related to the development, construction, operation or financing of the applicable projects. In addition, external sources of capital may not be adequate or available on reasonable terms. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. \n\nFixed-price long-term contracts for services or commodities expose our businesses to inflationary pressures.\n\nSempra Infrastructure seeks to secure long-term contracts for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of its facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. Certain of these contracts are at fixed prices, and their profitability may be negatively affected by inflationary pressures, including increased labor, materials, equipment, commodities and other operational costs, rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates. We aim to mitigate these risks by, among other things, using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating and providing for cost escalation when bidding on projects, contracting for direct pass-through of operating costs and/or entering into hedges. However, these measures may not fully or substantially offset any increases in operating expenses or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and their use could introduce additional risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate and inflation risks.\n\nOur operations in Mexico pose foreign currency exchange rate and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to Mexico and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue, cash flows and costs from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We sometimes attempt to hedge cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not fully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A” and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n\nOur businesses are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices.\n\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for pipeline operations, LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors, including inflation, adverse weather conditions, supply and demand changes, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, political and geopolitical instability, commodity production levels and storage capacity, energy and environmental legislation and regulations, and economic and financial market conditions. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal, regulatory, tax, economic, geopolitical, credit and management oversight risks and challenges.\n\nWe own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and we do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, and the occurrence of any of these \n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  60\n\n\nrisks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. These risks include the following and the other risks discussed in this risk factor below: \n\n▪compliance with tax, trade, environmental and other foreign laws and regulations, including legal limitations on ownership in some foreign countries and inadequate or inconsistent enforcement of regulations\n\n▪actions by local regulatory bodies, such as the CRE, including setting rates and tariffs that may be earned by or charged to our businesses\n\n▪the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control and recovery may be delayed and/or insufficient to recover our costs\n\n▪adverse changes in social, political, economic or market conditions or the stability of foreign governments or such foreign governments’ relations with the U.S. government\n\n▪adverse rulings by or instability in foreign courts or tribunals\n\n▪challenges obtaining, maintaining and complying with permits or approvals\n\n▪difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights and differing legal standards\n\n▪expropriation or theft of assets\n\n▪demand for hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas imported from the U.S., may be impacted by geopolitical factors\n\n▪with respect to our non-utility international business activities, changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by many of the factors listed above, among others\n\nMexican Government Influence on Economic and Energy Matters\n\nThe Mexican government exercises significant and increasing influence over the Mexican energy sector and has adopted or proposed additional changes that, in each case, could impact private investment in this sector.\n\nMexican governmental actions in the past several years in the electricity market include resolutions, orders, decrees, regulations and proposed and adopted amendments to Mexican law that could, among other things, threaten the prospects for private-party renewable energy generation in the country, limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits, increase costs of electricity for legacy renewable and cogeneration energy contract holders, and limit ownership of energy assets by private companies. We discuss some of these actions in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, the government of Mexico has implemented Mexican Constitutional energy reforms that will impact energy infrastructure and markets in Mexico. We await legislative action to determine the potential impact such reforms will have on the market generally and our business in particular.\n\nWith respect to midstream and downstream activities, Mexico’s Hydrocarbons Law gives SENER and the CRE significant powers to suspend permits when a danger to national security, energy security, or the national economy is foreseen and to revoke permits under certain other circumstances, including for a failure to comply with certain minimum storage and other requirements or for violations of certain provisions established by SENER or the Hydrocarbons Law, as applicable. Recent Mexican Constitutional reforms have proposed to transfer significant powers from CRE to SENER; implementing legislation on these reforms is expected to be forthcoming.\n\nSubsequent to the federal elections in Mexico in 2024 and, as noted above, the Mexican government has begun to introduce significant changes to the Mexican Constitution, which will require changes in laws, policies, and regulations in order to be implemented. These changes have included Mexican Constitutional reforms affecting the judiciary and the for-profit status of certain state-owned enterprises. The changes to the judiciary include a requirement that all judges be elected rather than appointed. The energy reforms have the potential to increase government control and participation in the energy sector and to create novel challenges for infrastructure development and operations. Additionally, a set of six energy-related laws, including modifications to the Hydrocarbons Law and Electricity Industry Law, were submitted to Mexico’s Congress in January 2025. The legislative session runs from February 1 to April 30, and the government is targeting approval by the end of March 2025. These reforms and any further Mexican Constitutional, legal or regulatory changes could affect the Mexican economy, energy sector and our businesses, the extent of which we currently are unable to predict.\n\nIf future governmental actions are proposed and passed or otherwise become effective, if efforts to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn adopted governmental actions fail, or if other similar actions by the Mexican government are taken to curb private-party participation in the energy sector, including through further amendments to Mexican laws, rules or the Mexican Constitution or increased investigative and enforcement activities, it may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and for its power consumers, adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\n2024 Form 10-K  |  61\n\n\nU.S. and Foreign Laws and International Relations\n\nOur international business activities are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and Mexico and other countries where we do business related to foreign operations and doing business internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley Federal Anticorrupción en Contrataciones Públicas) and similar laws, and are sensitive to foreign policy, trade policy and other geopolitical factors related to or applicable in each of these countries. The current and the last U.S. Administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements, tariffs, immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations. The current U.S. Administration proposed imposing new tariffs on Mexico that are currently deferred, but may become effective in the near term, and other tariffs could potentially be imposed by the current U.S. Administration. The Mexican government has announced plans to implement retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. Administration’s proposed tariffs, if and when they are imposed, but the details of those tariffs have not yet been disclosed. In addition, the U.S. Administration has announced tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum beginning on March 12, 2025. These materials are integral to the construction of energy infrastructure and could have a significant impact on the costs associated with the construction of the same, whether directly or indirectly. Other shifts in foreign policy could create uncertainty and result in or increase adverse effects on our businesses. Violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above, as well as foreign policy positions, sanctions or imposition of new or greater tariffs that adversely affect imports and exports between the U.S., Mexican and other foreign countries where we conduct business, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nWe face risks related to unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico.\n\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our ECA LNG projects are expected to be situated, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have and may in the future seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure on land we do not own. In addition to the risks associated with such property ownership and use that we describe above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses – Operational Risks,” disputes regarding ownership or rights to any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\n\nSempra Infrastructure’s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.",
