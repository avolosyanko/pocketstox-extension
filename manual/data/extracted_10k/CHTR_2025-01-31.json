      "text": "Item 1.  Business. \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe are a leading broadband connectivity company and cable operator with services available to an estimated 57 million homes and businesses in 41 states through our Spectrum® brand.  Over an advanced communications network, we offer a full range of state-of-the-art residential and business services including Spectrum Internet®, TV, Mobile and Voice.  For small and medium-sized companies, Spectrum Business® delivers the same suite of broadband products and services coupled with special features and applications to enhance productivity, while for larger businesses and government entities, Spectrum Enterprise® provides highly customized, fiber-based solutions. Spectrum Reach® delivers tailored advertising and production for the modern media landscape. We also distribute award-winning news coverage and sports programming to our customers through Spectrum Networks.   \n\nOur strategy is focused on utilizing our high bandwidth connectivity network to deliver high-quality, competitively priced products, with outstanding service, allowing us to increase both the number of customers we serve over our network and the number of products we sell to each customer.  This combination also reduces the number of service transactions we perform per relationship, yielding higher customer satisfaction and lower customer churn, which results in lower costs to acquire and serve customers and greater profitability.  \n\nProducts\n\nWe continue to evolve our connectivity network to offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit Internet speeds across our entire footprint and have launched symmetrical Internet service in eight markets and 2x1 Gbps service in two markets.  Advanced WiFi, a managed WiFi service that provides customers an optimized home network while providing greater control of connected devices with enhanced security and privacy, is available to all Internet customers.  Spectrum Mobile® is available to all new and existing Internet customers and offers plans that include 5G access, do not require contracts and include taxes and fees in the price. We continue to innovate our video product and recently transformed all of our affiliation agreements with major programmers. These new agreements give us greater overall packaging flexibility and the ability to include the ad-supported versions of key programmer streaming applications within our video packages along with the ability to upgrade to ad-free versions and to sell those applications to customers a la carte for a seamless entertainment experience. Together with our Xumo Stream Boxes (“Xumo”), our goal is to deliver utility and value for our customers, irrespective of how they want to view content, and better and more stable economics for our programming partners and us.\n\nPricing & Packaging and Customer Commitments\n\nOur fully deployed high-bandwidth network offers ubiquitous and seamless connectivity products.  It removes barriers and creates opportunities for customers, in every aspect of their lives, which led us to our new brand platform, Life Unlimited™.  As part of the new brand platform, which we launched in the fall of 2024, we also launched a new, simplified pricing strategy that better utilizes our seamless connectivity and entertainment products to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive customer and financial growth. Additionally, we announced new customer commitments, focused on reliable connectivity, transparency, exceptional service and a focus on always improving.  Through reliable connectivity, we are committed to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time and promptly resolving issues. Transparency at every step means we are committed to clear and simple pricing and timely service updates, and we will take responsibility when things go wrong. Through exceptional service, we are committed to providing exceptional customer experiences.  And finally, always improving means we act on our customers' feedback to improve our products and customer service.\n\nNetwork Evolution \n\nOur network and product evolution plan continues to progress, with a clear path to delivering symmetrical and multi-gig speeds to our customers across our footprint, meeting the needs of today and anticipating the growing demand for faster speeds for years to come.  We continue to expand the capacity of our hybrid fiber coaxial network using a number of technologies, including spectrum expansion, initially to 1.2 GHz and then to 1.8 GHz, changing the bandwidth allocation to a \"high split\" to increase upstream speeds, Distributed Access Architecture (\"DAA\") and DOCSIS 4.0 technology.  Through this process, which we expect to complete in 2027, we will transform our network to enable multi-gigabit data speeds to customers. Those faster speeds will be offered in conjunction with our Spectrum Mobile product and Advanced WiFi, providing customers seamless and convenient, ultra-fast converged connectivity in attractively priced packages. \n\n1\n\nExpansion\n\nSince inception in the beginning of 2022, we have spent $5.5 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative and activated approximately 813,000 passings.  Rural builds present strategic footprint expansion opportunities to unserved and underserved passings.  Our rural investments will allow us to offer a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile to unserved areas in states where we currently operate.  To accomplish all of this, we have invested in new teams, new training and new equipment. These investments will allow us to generate long-term infrastructure-style returns by taking further advantage of our scale efficiencies, network quality and construction capabilities, while offering our high-quality products and services to more homes and businesses.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 400 Washington Blvd., Stamford, Connecticut 06902.  Our telephone number is (203) 905-7801, and we have a website accessible at ir.charter.com.  Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed.  The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this annual report. \n\n2\n\nCorporate Entity Structure \n\nThe chart below sets forth our entity structure and that of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The chart does not include all of our affiliates and subsidiaries and, in some cases, we have combined separate entities for presentation purposes.  The equity ownership percentages shown below for Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”) are approximations.  Indebtedness amounts shown below are principal amounts as of December 31, 2024.  See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” which also includes the accreted values of the indebtedness described below.  \n\n3\n\nFootprint\n\nWe operate in geographically diverse areas which are managed centrally on a consolidated level.  The map below highlights our footprint along with our planned rural expansion over the span of the initiative based on grants awarded as of December 31, 2024.  \n\nProducts and Services \n\nWe offer our customers subscription-based Internet, video, mobile and voice services, with prices and related charges based on the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on an individual basis, and based on the equipment necessary to receive our services.  Bundled services, including some combination of our Internet, video, mobile and/or voice products are available to substantially all of our passings. \n\n4\n\nThe following table summarizes our customer statistics for Internet, video, mobile and voice as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands except per customer data and footnotes). \n\nApproximate as of\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2024 (a)\n\n2023 (a)\n\nCustomer Relationships (b)\n\nResidential29,258 29,904 \n\nSmall and Medium Business (\"SMB\")2,215 2,222 \n\nTotal Customer Relationships 31,473 32,126 \n\nMonthly Residential Revenue per Residential Customer (c)\n\n$121.04 $119.89 \n\nMonthly SMB Revenue per SMB Customer (d)\n\n$164.08 $163.64 \n\nInternet\n\nResidential28,034 28,544 \n\nSMB2,046 2,044 \n\nTotal Internet Customers30,080 30,588 \n\nVideo\n\nResidential12,327 13,503 \n\nSMB565 619 \n\nTotal Video Customers12,892 14,122 \n\nMobile Lines (e)\n\nResidential9,568 7,519 \n\nSMB315 247 \n\nTotal Mobile Lines9,883 7,766 \n\nVoice\n\nResidential5,636 6,712 \n\nSMB1,248 1,293 \n\nTotal Voice Customers6,884 8,005 \n\nEnterprise Primary Service Units (\"PSUs\") (f)\n\n319 303 \n\n(a)We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account in accordance with our collection policies.  On that basis, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, customers include approximately 102,500 and 135,800 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 12,100 and 54,700 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due, and approximately 13,600 and 286,000 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.  The decrease in accounts past due is predominately due to revisions to customer account balances associated with the end of the Federal Communications Commission's (“FCC”) Affordable Connectivity Program (\"ACP\"), including balance write-offs and conversion to payment plans.     \n\n(b)Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing Internet, video, mobile and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive.  Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”) and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU.  Total customer relationships exclude enterprise and mobile-only customer relationships.\n\n(c)Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective year and excludes mobile-only customers.\n\n(d)Monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer is calculated as total SMB annual revenue divided by twelve divided by average SMB customer relationships during the respective year and excludes mobile-only customers.\n\n(e)Mobile lines include phones and tablets which require one of our standard rate plans (e.g., \"Unlimited\" or \"By the Gig\").  Mobile lines exclude wearables and other devices that do not require standard phone rate plans.\n\n5\n\n(f)Enterprise PSUs represent the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering at each customer location as an individual PSU.\n\nResidential Services\n\nConnectivity Services\n\nWe provide our customers with a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile, which when bundled together provides our customers with a differentiated converged connectivity experience while saving consumers money.    \n\nWe offer Spectrum Internet products with speeds up to 1 Gbps across our entire footprint.  Spectrum Internet bundled with our in-home Advanced WiFi allows multiple people within a single household to stream high definition (“HD”) video content while simultaneously using our Internet service for other purposes including two-way video conferencing, gaming and virtual reality, among other things.    \n\nOur in-home WiFi product provides our Internet customers with high performance wireless routers and a managed WiFi service to maximize their wireless Internet experience.  We offer Advanced WiFi service across all of our footprint along with WiFi 6E routers capable of delivering speeds over 2 Gbps.  In 2024, we began offering WiFi 7 routers capable of delivering speeds over 10 Gbps.  With Advanced WiFi, customers enjoy a cloud-optimized WiFi connection and have the ability to view and control their WiFi network through our Spectrum app (“My Spectrum® App”).  The service enables parental control schedules and Spectrum Security Shield which is automatically enabled and protects all devices in the home using network-based security.  Customers also have the option to add Spectrum WiFi pods to Advanced WiFi.  WiFi pods are small, discreet access points that plug into electrical outlets in the home, providing broader and more consistent WiFi coverage.\n\nWe also offer the capabilities of the Advanced WiFi service to MDUs as Advanced Community WiFi (“ACW”).  With ACW, tenants receive the same visibility and control over their apartment’s WiFi networks through the My Spectrum App, while building managers are able to see and manage the entire building’s network through a purpose-built property service portal.  In 2024, we began offering to MDUs and bulk single-family communities Spectrum Ready, which allows customers to set up Spectrum Internet with Advanced WiFi and video services in their home without ordering equipment or scheduling installation through permanent WiFi routers already installed in the property.  New residents simply scan a QR code and confirm services through a new or existing Spectrum account.   \n\nOur Spectrum Mobile service is offered to customers subscribing to our Internet service and uses the customers’ private WiFi, our Spectrum Mobile network (comprised of out-of-home WiFi access points across our footprint combined with out-of-home WiFi access points from other networks with which we partner) as well as leveraging the cellular network of Verizon Communications Inc. (\"Verizon\").  We leverage the Verizon cellular network to provide nationwide coverage including unlimited calls, text and data using Verizon’s fourth generation and fifth generation (“5G”) service including their 5G ultra-wide band services.  Spectrum Mobile also uses Verizon’s international roaming partner network to ensure customers have coverage around the globe. Customers can use their Spectrum Mobile device to connect to their Spectrum WiFi, which increases speeds and provides a superior experience while in the home and on-the-go via the Spectrum Mobile network.  In addition, we continue to focus on improving the customer experience and integrating our mobile and fixed Internet products with enhancements such as Spectrum Mobile Speed Boost (“Speed Boost”).  Customers are eligible for Speed Boost if they have both Spectrum Mobile and Spectrum Internet, a DOCSIS 3.1 modem and an Advanced WiFi router.  When connected on their Spectrum Mobile device through Advanced WiFi service, customers are now experiencing the fastest overall speeds up to 1 Gbps.  \n\nWe provide wireline voice communications services using voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) technology to transmit digital voice signals over our network.  Our voice services include unlimited local and long distance calling to the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers international calling either by the minute, or through packages of minutes per month.  We also offer Call Guard, an advanced caller ID and robocall blocking solution, for our residential and SMB voice customers. Call Guard reduces customer frustration and improves security by blocking malicious calls while ensuring our customers continue to receive the legitimate automated calls they need from schools or healthcare providers.\n\n6\n\nVideo Services \n\nWe provide our customers with a choice of video programming services on a variety of platforms including through a digital Spectrum Receiver or an Internet Protocol (\"IP\") device. Video customers have access to a variety of programming packages with approximately 375 channels available in home and out of home allowing our customers to access the programming they want, when they want it, on any device. In 2024, we began offering certain seamless entertainment applications including, among others, Max, Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, ViX Premium and Tennis Channel Plus to customers in certain packages and reached agreements with several other programmers that will add Discovery+, Peacock, AMC+ and BET+ in certain packages in 2025.  We now have completed deals with every major programmer to deliver better flexibility and greater value to our customers by including seamless entertainment applications with our Spectrum TV® services at no additional cost.  \n\nOur video service also includes access to an interactive programming guide with parental controls, video on demand (“VOD”) and pay-per-view services.  VOD service allows customers to select from approximately 100,000 titles at any time.  VOD programming options may be accessed at no additional cost if the content is associated with a customer’s linear subscription, or for a fee on a transactional basis.  VOD services are also offered on a subscription basis, included in a digital tier premium channel subscription, or for a monthly fee.  Pay-per-view channels allow customers with a set-top box to pay on a per-event basis to view a single showing of a one-time special sporting event, music concert, or similar event on a commercial-free basis. We also offer digital video recorder (“DVR”) service that enables customers to digitally record programming and to pause and rewind live programming on set-top boxes.  Our cloud DVR service allows customers to schedule, record and watch their favorite programming anytime from the Spectrum TV app as well as SpectrumTV.com. \n\nWe continue to deploy our Xumo stream boxes to new video customers.  Xumo combines a live TV experience with access to hundreds of content applications and features unified search and discovery along with a curated content offering based on the customer's interests and subscriptions.  Combined with our Spectrum TV app, Xumo is now our preferred go-to-market platform for new video sales.  \n\nCustomers are increasingly accessing their subscription video content through our highly rated Spectrum TV app via mobile devices and connected IP devices, such as Xumo, Apple TV, Roku and Samsung TV.  Access to the Spectrum TV app is included in all Spectrum TV video plans.  The Spectrum TV app allows users to stream content across a growing number of platforms as well as access their full TV lineup and watch on demand content.  It also supports DVR functionality through our cloud DVR offering.    \n\nCommercial Services \n\nWe offer scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes, selling Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services.  \n\nSmall and Medium Business\n\nSpectrum Business offers Internet, video, mobile and voice services to SMBs over our hybrid fiber coaxial network.  We also offer Advanced WiFi service to SMBs, which leverages the residential platform features, including Security Shield, with features specific to small and medium-size business such as a guest service set identifier (“SSID”).  Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming and offers Internet speeds up to 1 Gbps across our entire footprint.  Spectrum Business also includes a set of business services including static IP and business WiFi, e-mail and security, and voice services through either a traditional voice offering or hosted voice solution.  Spectrum Business Connect is an SMB communications solution that includes Spectrum Internet, voice and complementary mobility features allowing our customers’ remote and office employees to stay more easily connected regardless of their location.  We also offer Wireless Internet Backup to our SMB customers which is designed to enhance and protect Internet service for SMBs in the event of a network disruption.  \n\nEnterprise \n\nSpectrum Enterprise offers tailored connectivity, communications and managed service solutions over a high-capacity last-mile network with speeds up to 100 Gbps to larger businesses and government entities (local, state and federal), in addition to wholesale services to mobile and wireline carriers.  The Spectrum Enterprise product portfolio includes connectivity services such as Internet Access (fiber, coax and wireless delivered); Wide Area Network (“WAN”) services (Ethernet, Software Defined (“SD”)-WAN and cloud connectivity) that privately and securely connect geographically dispersed customer locations and cloud service providers; and Managed Service solutions which address a wide range of enterprise networking (e.g. routing, \n\n7\n\nLocal Area Network (“LAN”), WiFi) and security (e.g. firewall, Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) protection) challenges. To meet the communications needs of these more sophisticated customers, Spectrum Enterprise also offers an array of voice trunking services and unified messaging, communications and collaboration products. We offer Unified Communications services integrated with our connectivity and managed services to give customers more choices for enhancing their digital experience across locations and devices.  In addition, Spectrum Enterprise offers a wide range of video solutions targeting unique needs of customers across multiple industries with a specific focus on hospitality, healthcare, government and education. Spectrum Enterprise serves businesses nationally by combining its large serviceable footprint with a robust portfolio of fiber lit buildings and a significant wholesale partner network. As a result, these customers benefit by obtaining advanced solutions from a single provider who is committed to an exceptional customer experience and who delivers compelling value by simplifying procurement and offering competitive pricing potentially reducing our customers' costs.\n\nAdvertising Services\n\nOur advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach, offers local, regional and national businesses the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple service areas on cable television networks, various streaming services and numerous advanced advertising platforms.  We receive revenues from the sale of local advertising across various platforms for networks such as TBS, CNN and ESPN.  We insert local advertising on up to 100 channels in over 90 markets and on multiple streaming services/free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) channels including Amazon, Xumo and others.  Our large footprint provides opportunities for advertising customers to address broader regional audiences from a single provider and thus reach more customers with a single transaction.  Our size also provides scale to invest in new technology to create more targeted and addressable advertising capabilities. \n\nAvailable advertising time is generally sold by our advertising sales force.  In some service areas, we have formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, including, among others, Verizon, DirecTV and Comcast, under which we sell advertising on behalf of those operators.  In other service areas, we enter into representation agreements under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on our behalf.  These arrangements enable us and our partners to represent and deliver commercials on their inventory across wider geographic areas, replicating the reach of local broadcast television stations to the extent possible.  In addition, we enter into interconnect agreements from time to time with other cable operators, which, on behalf of a number of video operators, sell advertising time to national and regional advertisers in individual or multiple service areas.\n\nAdditionally, we sell the advertising inventory of our owned and operated local sports and news channels, of our regional sports networks that carry Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and other sports programming and of SportsNet LA, a regional sports network that carries Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming.\n\nIn conjunction with other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), Spectrum Reach enables multi-channel cable networks (e.g. AMC, Univision) to deploy household addressability on their own inventory in our footprint, charging them an enablement fee.  Our fully deployed Audience App, which uses our proprietary set-top box viewership data (all anonymized and aggregated), allows us to create data-driven linear TV campaigns for local advertisers.  Spectrum Reach also offers a programmatic sales platform allowing advertising agencies and advertisers to buy inventory in a fully automated way.  Streaming TV, which is largely comprised of Spectrum TV app impressions, as well as those from numerous over-the-top streaming content providers, is part of our suite of advanced advertising products available to the marketplace.  Additionally, Spectrum Reach purchases third-party inventory in our markets when needed.  Spectrum Reach is also now employing multi-screen deterministic attribution services for television and streaming services that lets advertisers know the effectiveness of their advertising on Spectrum Reach’s platform.\n\nOther Services\n\nRegional Sports Networks \n\nWe have an agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers for rights to distribute all locally available Los Angeles Lakers’ games through 2033. We broadcast those games on our regional sports network, Spectrum SportsNet.  American Media Productions, LLC (\"American Media Productions\"), an unaffiliated third party, owns SportsNet LA, a regional sports network carrying the Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming.  In accordance with agreements with American Media Productions, we act as the network’s exclusive affiliate and advertising sales representative and have certain branding and programming rights with respect to the network.  In addition, we provide certain production and technical services to American Media Productions. The affiliate, advertising, production and programming agreements continue through 2038.  We also own \n\n8\n\n26.8% of Sterling Entertainment Enterprises, LLC (doing business as SportsNet New York), a New York City-based regional sports network that carries New York Mets’ baseball games as well as other regional sports programming.\n\nNews Channels\n\nWe own and manage over 30 local news channels, including Spectrum News NY1® and Spectrum News SoCal, 24-hour news channels focused on New York City and Los Angeles, respectively. Our local news channels connect the diverse communities and neighborhoods we serve providing 24/7 news, weather and community content focused on hyperlocal stories that address the deeper needs and interests of our customers.  Customers can also read, watch and listen to news stories by our Spectrum News journalists and local partner publications on their mobile device on our Spectrum News application and certain smart TVs and streaming devices.\n\nCommunity Solutions\n\nSpectrum Community Solutions® (“SCS”) delivers broadband connectivity solutions to apartments, single-family gated communities, off-campus student housing, senior residences and RV parks and marinas. Services offered by SCS include Internet speeds up to 2 Gbps, property-wide managed WiFi coverage, Spectrum Ready service and traditional and streaming video packages, as well as customized fiber and coaxial solutions for new construction and established communities.  SCS also manages our relationships with third-party resellers of Spectrum services to MDUs.  In addition, SCS is responsible for our non-bulk MDU salesforce covering sales within existing, serviceable MDU properties.  Our SCS bulk customers are serviced by dedicated call centers.\n\nPricing of Our Products and Services \n\nOur revenues are principally derived from the monthly fees customers pay for the services we provide.  We typically charge a one-time installation fee which is sometimes waived or discounted in certain sales channels during certain promotional periods. \n\nOur Spectrum pricing and packaging generally offers a standardized price across our services with bundle options designed to drive more value into a package to fit the customer need.  We believe Spectrum pricing and packaging:\n\n•offers a higher quality and more value-based set of services relative to our competitors, including fast Internet speeds, with integrated mobile and video options and a transparent pricing structure;\n\n•offers simplicity for customers to understand our offers, and for our employees in service delivery;\n\n•drives our ability to package more services at the time of sale, thus increasing revenue per customer;\n\n•drives higher customer satisfaction, lower service calls and churn; and\n\n•allows for gradual price increases at the end of promotional periods.\n\nWe also have specialized offerings to enhance affordability of our Internet product for qualified low-income households, including Spectrum Internet Assist, a 50 megabits per second (\"Mbps\") service, and Internet Advantage, a 100 Mbps service.  Both are low cost and include a modem for no additional charge.  \n\nIn 2024, we introduced new bundles that better utilize our unique product assets with guaranteed pricing for up to three years and speed options that will benefit new customers, create more choices and provide faster speeds for existing customers.  For customers who don’t take advantage of these new bundled rates, our Spectrum One™ offering provides a differentiated connectivity experience by bringing together Spectrum Internet, Advanced WiFi and Unlimited Spectrum Mobile to offer consumers fast, reliable and secure online connections on their favorite devices at home and on-the-go in a high-value package.  Alternatively, our mobile customers can choose from unlimited or by-the-gig data usage plans and can easily switch between mobile data plans during the month. All plans include 5G service, free nationwide talk and text, and simple pricing that includes all taxes and fees.  Our Unlimited Plus plan also includes an additional 20 gigabytes of data, free roaming in Canada and Mexico and our Anytime Upgrade program that allows customers to upgrade their devices whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements.  Customers can also purchase mobile devices and accessory products and have the option to pay for devices under interest-free monthly installment plans.  Our device portfolio includes 5G models from Apple, Google and Samsung and we offer trade-in options along with our Phone Balance Buyout program which makes switching mobile providers easier by helping customers pay off balances on ported lines.  \n\n9\n\nOur Network Technology \n\nOur network includes three key components: a national backbone, regional/metro networks and a “last-mile” network.  Both our national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize a redundant IP ring/mesh fiber architecture.  The national backbone component provides connectivity from regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services.  The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components.\n\nOur last-mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable.  In most systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node.  Our design standard allows spare fiber strands to each node to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise.  For our Spectrum Enterprise customers, fiber optic cable is extended to the customer’s site.  For most new buildouts, including for our rural construction initiative, and MDU sites, we utilize a fiber deployment. We believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality with a cost-efficient path to increased speeds.  \n\nHFC architecture benefits include: \n\n•bandwidth capacity to enable video and broadband services;\n\n•dedicated bandwidth for delivering higher signal quality and service reliability, which provides an advantage over cell phone home Internet offerings; \n\n•the ability to upgrade capacity at a lower incremental capital cost relative to our competitors; \n\n•a powered network enabling out-of-home Advanced WiFi and 5G small cell access points; and\n\n•existing infrastructure with connections capable of self installation by the customer in most of our passings. \n\nOur systems currently provide a two-way all-digital platform, leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology and bandwidth of 750 megahertz or greater, to virtually all of our passings.  This bandwidth-rich network enables us to offer a large selection of HD channels and Spectrum Internet Gig across all of our footprint which enables us to provide fast, reliable and secure online connections, meeting current customer demands.  \n\nThrough our network evolution initiative, we are currently expanding our spectrum to 1.2 Ghz through a module upgrade in the hub, node and amplifier and using high splits and DAA to deliver multi-gig speed capabilities while using the current DOCSIS 3.1 customer premise equipment. When paired with the next generation of DOCSIS modem, DOCSIS 4.0, we will be able to deliver even faster speeds.  Next, we will begin to deploy DOCSIS 4.0 technology in the network, and further increase our spectrum to 1.8 Ghz enabling even higher speed capabilities.  This network evolution will also allow us to extend fiber services to the home in a success based “Fiber on Demand” manner.  \n\nWe plan to complement our wireline investments with planned WiFi upgrades for in-home routers. With nearly 500 million devices connected wirelessly to our network in our customers' homes and businesses, we are unlocking our network investments for multi-gigabit speeds through the deployment of WiFi 7 routers that we launched in late 2024. \n\nWe own 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) Priority Access Licenses (“PALs”).  We intend to use these licenses along with unlicensed CBRS spectrum to build our own 5G data-only mobile network on targeted 5G small cell sites leveraging our HFC network to provide power and data connectivity to the majority of the sites.  These 5G small cells, combined with growing WiFi capabilities, increase speed and reliability along with improving our cost structure through offload of wireless data onto our owned networks.  We continue to deploy 5G small cell sites in targeted areas of our footprint, as part of our broader multi-year 5G mobile network buildout, based on disciplined cost reduction targets.\n\nSubsidized Rural Construction Initiative\n\nIn 2024, we continued our subsidized rural construction initiative in which we intend to expand our network to offer a suite of broadband connectivity services, including fixed Internet, WiFi and mobile to over 1.7 million passings in unserved areas in states where we currently operate.  Since inception in the beginning of 2022, we have spent $5.5 billion on our subsidized rural construction initiative and activated approximately 813,000 passings.  Including amounts spent to date, we expect to invest over $8 billion in total over the span of the initiative, a portion of which we expect to offset with government funding, including over $2 billion of support awarded through December 31, 2024 in the Rural Development Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) auction and other federal, state and municipal grants.  We also expect to participate in additional federal, state and municipal grant programs \n\n10\n\nover the coming years, including the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) program, if regulatory conditions are conducive to private investment.  In addition to construction in areas subsidized by various government grants, we expect to continue rural construction in areas near our current plant and in areas surrounding subsidized construction where synergies can be achieved.  These investments will allow us to generate long-term infrastructure-style returns by further taking advantage of our scale efficiencies, network quality and construction capabilities, while offering our high-quality products and services to more homes and businesses. We expect these newly served homes will be enabled to engage in remote work, virtual learning, telemedicine and other bandwidth-heavy applications that require high speed broadband connectivity. Newly served rural areas will also benefit from our high-value Spectrum pricing and packaging structure including our mobile and voice offerings, as well as our comprehensive selection of video products.  The successful and timely execution of such fiber-based construction is dependent on a variety of external factors, including the make-ready and utility pole permitting processes.  With fewer homes and businesses in these areas, broadband providers need to access multiple poles per home, as opposed to multiple homes per pole in higher-density settings.  As a result, pole applications, pole replacement rules and their affiliated issue resolution processes are all factors that can have a significant impact on construction timing and speed to completion.  The RDOF auction rules and other subsidy grants establish construction milestones for the build-out utilizing subsidized funding.  Failure to meet those milestones could subject us to financial penalties.   \n\nManagement, Customer Operations and Marketing \n\nOur operations are centralized, with senior executives responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations, including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures.  Sales and marketing, field operations, customer operations, network operations, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level.  Regional and local field operations are responsible for customer premise service transactions and maintaining and constructing that portion of our network which is located outdoors.  Our field operations strategy includes completing a significant portion of our activity with our own employees which we find drives consistent and higher quality services.  In 2024, our in-house field operations workforce handled approximately 85% of our customer premise service transactions.  In addition, we have been growing our in-house construction teams to perform a portion of our network expansion initiatives.    \n\nWe continue to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and delivery of quality customer service.  As part of our operating strategy, we insource most of our customer operations workload.  Our in-house call centers handle all of our customer service calls.  We manage our customer service call centers centrally to ensure a consistent, high-quality customer experience.  In addition, we route calls by call type to specific agents that only handle such call types, enabling agents to become experts in addressing specific customer needs, creating a better customer experience.  Service from our call centers continues to become more efficient as a result of new tool enhancements that give our front-line customer service agents more context and real-time information about the customer and their services which allows them to more effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues.  Our call center agent desktop interface tool enables virtualization of all call centers thereby better serving our customers.  Virtualization allows calls to be routed across our call centers regardless of the location origin of the call, reducing call wait times, and saving costs.       \n\nWe also provide customers with the opportunity to interact with us in the manner they choose through self-service options on our customer website and mobile device application, or via telephonic communication, online chat and social media. Our customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order and activate new services and utilize self-service help and support.  In addition, our self-install program has been beneficial for customers who need flexibility in the timing of their installation.\n\nWe sell our residential and commercial services using national brand platforms known as Spectrum, Spectrum Business, Spectrum Enterprise, Spectrum Reach and Spectrum Community Solutions.  These brands reflect our comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation.  Our marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of our bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers, and increases awareness and the value of the Spectrum brand.  Our marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships, increase the number of services we sell per relationship, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers.  We monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, in order to increase our responsiveness to our customers and to improve our sales and customer retention.  In September 2024, we launched our Life Unlimited brand platform which includes a new customer commitment that provides performance and service benchmarks and a new and simplified pricing structure designed to drive more value into our relationships.  The marketing organization manages all residential, SMB and enterprise sales channels including inbound, direct sales, online, outbound telemarketing and stores.\n\n11\n\nProgramming \n\nWe believe that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer’s decision to subscribe to and retain our video and Internet services.  We obtain basic and premium programming, usually pursuant to written contracts from a number of suppliers.  We have also been successful in obtaining access to the related programmer streaming applications pursuant to those contracts.  Media corporation and broadcast station group consolidation has, however, resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programming suppliers.  \n\nProgramming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make that programming available.  Programming license fees may include various discounts such as “volume” discounts and other financial incentives and/or ongoing marketing support, as well as discounts for service penetration.  We receive revenue to carry home shopping channels.  We also offer VOD and pay-per-view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider.  \n\nCompetition\n\nResidential Services\n\nWe face intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors and, as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants. \n\nInternet Competition\n\nOur residential Internet service faces competition across our footprint from fiber-to-the-home (\"FTTH\"), fixed wireless broadband, Internet delivered via satellite and DSL services.  AT&T Inc. (\"AT&T\"), Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) and Verizon are our primary FTTH competitors and several of these FTTH competitors deliver 1 Gbps broadband speed (and some deliver multi Gbps) in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap our footprint.  Additionally, several national mobile network operators offer long-term evolution (“LTE”) or 5G delivered cell phone home Internet service (fixed wireless access from cell phone towers) in our markets.  In several markets, we also face competition from one or more fixed wireless providers that deliver point-to-point Internet connectivity.  DSL service is offered across our footprint often at prices lower than our Internet services, although typically at speeds much lower than the minimum speeds we offer as part of our Spectrum pricing and packaging.  In addition, commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer WiFi Internet service.  Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized WiFi Internet access networks.  In addition, providers are constructing open access networks that can deliver services from multiple underlying Internet service providers.  These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access.  We face terrestrial broadband Internet (defined by the FCC as at least 100 Mbps) competition from three primary competitors, AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, in approximately 25%, 9% and 6% of our operating footprint, respectively.  \n\nVideo Competition\n\nOur residential video service faces growing competition across our footprint from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices.  Increasingly, exclusive television content, including marquee content like live sporting events, is becoming available from sources other than traditional MVPDs.  These competitors include virtual MVPDs such as YouTube TV, Hulu Live, Sling TV, Philo and DirecTV Stream.  Other online video business models and products have also developed, some offered by programmers, including, (i) subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) services such as Netflix, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, (ii) programmer streaming applications such as Max, Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+, (iii) ad-supported free online video products, including YouTube and Pluto TV, some of which offer programming for free to consumers that we currently purchase for a fee, (iv) pay-per-view products, such as iTunes, and (v) additional offerings from mobile providers which continue to integrate and bundle video services and mobile products.  Historically, we have generally viewed SVOD online video services as complementary to our own video offering and, in the case of programmer streaming applications, we are packaging with the linear offerings.  However, services from virtual MVPDs and programmer streaming applications, as well as piracy and password sharing, negatively impact the number of customers purchasing our video product.\n\nOur residential video service also faces competition from DBS service providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all of our operating areas.  DBS providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes.  DBS providers offer aggressive promotional pricing and video services \n\n12\n\nthat are comparable in many respects to our residential video service.  Our residential video service also faces competition from large telecommunications companies, primarily Verizon, which offer wireline video services in significant portions of our operating areas.\n\nMobile Competition\n\nOur mobile service faces competition from national mobile network operators including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US, Inc. (\"T-Mobile\"), as well as a variety of regional operators and mobile virtual network operators.  Most carriers offer unlimited data packages to customers while some also offer free or highly discounted devices.  Various operators also offer wireless Internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds.  AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile continue to expand 5G mobile services, and consolidations in the telecom industry continue to increase competition as they seek to offer converged connectivity services similar to ours.  We also compete for retail activations with other resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for resale.    \n\nVoice Competition\n\nOur residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers across our footprint, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email.  We also compete with “over-the-top” phone providers as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service.  The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service.  \n\nAdditional Competition\n\nIn some of our operating areas, other regional competitors have built networks that offer Internet, video, mobile and voice services that compete with our services.  We also compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment, including over-the-air television broadcast reception, live events, movie theaters and the Internet.  Competition is also posed by fixed wireless and satellite master antenna television systems serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities. \n\nBusiness Services\n\nWe face intense competition across each of our business services product offerings.  Our SMB Internet, video, mobile and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above.  Our enterprise solutions face competition from the competitors described above as well as cloud-based application-service providers, managed service providers and other telecommunications carriers, such as metro and regional fiber-based carriers.  \n\nAdvertising\n\nWe face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors.  Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new advertising platforms seek to attract the same advertisers.  We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media, connected device platforms, direct-to-consumer ad-supported applications and online advertising companies and content providers.\n\nSeasonality and Cyclicality \n\nOur business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations.  Our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation service areas.  Our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels.  Our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season.  U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising.  Our capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth, network programs, specific projects and construction.  \n\n13\n\nLiberty Broadband Combination\n\nOn November 12, 2024, Charter, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter, and Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “merger agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Charter will acquire Liberty Broadband through the merger of Fusion Merger Sub 2, Inc. with and into Liberty Broadband (the “merger”), with Liberty Broadband surviving the merger and becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Charter.  Immediately following the merger, Liberty Broadband, as the surviving corporation of the merger, will merge with and into Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC (the “upstream merger” and together with the merger, the “combination”), with Fusion Merger Sub 1, LLC surviving the upstream merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter. \n\nAt the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”):\n\n•each share of (i) Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series A common stock”), (ii) Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series B common stock”), and (iii) Liberty Broadband Series C common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband Series C common stock” and together with the Liberty Broadband Series A common stock and the Liberty Broadband Series B common stock, the “Liberty Broadband common stock”), in each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 0.236 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Charter Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Charter Class A common stock”); and\n\n•each share of Liberty Broadband Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Liberty Broadband preferred stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded treasury shares as set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive one share of newly issued Charter Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Charter preferred stock”). The Charter preferred stock will have substantially identical terms to the Liberty Broadband preferred stock, including a mandatory redemption date of March 8, 2039.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband’s principal assets consist of approximately 45.3 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and its subsidiary GCI, LLC, which is comprised of one operating entity, GCI Holdings, LLC (“GCI”), Alaska’s largest communications provider.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to spin off GCI by way of a distribution to the stockholders of Liberty Broadband prior to the closing of the combination (the “GCI divestiture”).  The GCI distribution is expected to be taxable to Liberty Broadband and its stockholders, with Charter bearing the corporate level tax liability upon completion of the combination.  However, to the extent such corporate level tax liability exceeds $420 million, Charter will be entitled under a tax receivables agreement to the portion of the tax benefits realized by GCI corresponding to such excess.  Liberty Broadband has debt of $2.6 billion (excluding debt at GCI) as of September 30, 2024 that will be repaid prior to closing or assumed by Charter, and $180 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Liberty Broadband preferred stock that will be converted into an equal amount of Charter preferred stock in the combination.  The companies currently expect the transaction to close on June 30, 2027, unless otherwise agreed, subject to the completion of the GCI spin-off and other customary closing conditions.\n\nFor additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “The Combination,” “The Merger Agreement” and “Other Agreements Related to the Combination - Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment” included therein.\n\nRegulation and Legislation \n\nThe following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and our services for both residential and commercial customers.  Cable systems and related communications networks and services are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments and many local governments.  A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties.  Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings.  Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future.  We could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new laws, regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact our key competitors.  For example, Internet-delivered streaming video services compete with our traditional video service, but they are not subject to the same level of federal, state, and local regulation.  In addition, new Supreme Court \n\n14\n\ndecisions in 2024 may increase the likelihood that federal courts could vacate federal agency rules that would have been favorable or unfavorable to our business. We cannot provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future.  \n\nVideo Service\n\nMust Carry/Retransmission Consent\n\nThere are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems.  Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster.  Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions.  Popular stations routinely invoke “retransmission consent” and demand substantial compensation increases in their negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing our operating costs.\n\nPole Attachments\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), requires investor-owned utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits upon reasonable, non-discriminatory terms and at rates that are subject to either federal or state regulation.  Federal regulations, which apply in twenty-seven states, establish cost-based rental rates applicable to pole attachments used for cable or telecommunications services, including when offered together with Internet service, and at times establish mandatory timelines for processing pole access requests and limitations on make-ready costs that pole owners may charge for accommodating attachments.  The FCC's approach does not directly affect the rate in the twenty-three states that self-regulate, but many of those states have substantially the same rate for all communications attachments.  The federal pole attachment law does not extend to poles owned by electric cooperatives or municipal electric companies, but states are free to regulate these entities, and many do.  We sometimes face challenges getting access to poles in rural areas where upfront construction and make ready costs can be higher and where pole owners may be slow to grant our permit requests, especially when the FCC pole attachment rules do not apply or when FCC mandatory timelines do not apply, as is the case in most rural builds.\n\nOther FCC Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas applicable to our video services, including, among other things: (1) licensing of systems and facilities, including the grant of various spectrum licenses; (2) equal employment opportunity obligations; (3) customer service standards; (4) technical standards; (5) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (6) restrictions on political advertising; (7) restrictions on advertising in children’s programming; (8) ownership restrictions; (9) posting of certain information on an FCC “public file” website, including but not limited to political advertising records, equal employment opportunity practices, compliance with children’s programming requirements, policies for commercial leased access, system information, and channel carriage information including disclosure of our ownership interests in channels we carry; (10) emergency alert systems; (11) inside wiring and contracts for MDU complexes; (12) accessibility of content, including requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning; (13) competitive availability of cable equipment; (14) the provision of up to 15% of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties; (15) public, education and government entity access requirements; and (16) disclosure of an aggregated monthly “all-in” price on customer bills and advertising materials that include the price of video programming.  Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on our operations. \n\nThe FCC regulates spectrum usage in ways that could impact our operations including for microwave backhaul, broadcast, unlicensed WiFi and CBRS.  Our ability to access and use spectrum that may become available in the future is uncertain and may be limited by further FCC auction or allocation decisions.  While the FCC currently does not have auction authority, Congressional action to restore the FCC’s auction authority could direct spectrum be licensed in a manner beneficial to our competitors. New or additional spectrum obtained by other parties could lead to additional wireless competition to our existing and future services.\n\nIt is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems or the services delivered over cable systems and competing services in the future.  We cannot predict at this time what new requirements may be adopted and how such changes might impact our business.\n\n15\n\nCopyright\n\nThe carriage of television and radio broadcast signals by cable systems are subject to a federal compulsory copyright license.  The copyright law provides copyright owners the right to audit our payments under the compulsory license.  On December 16, 2024, the Copyright Office issued an order modifying the license’s royalty calculations and reporting obligations, however, we do not believe the impact of such modifications will be material to us.  The possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.\n\nFranchise Matters\n\nOur cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises, permits, and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights-of-way.  \n\nCable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply.  The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions.  They generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, access to and use of rights of way, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, supporting and carrying public, education and government access channels, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee.  Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators.  For example, federal law imposes a cap on franchise fees of 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable services over the cable system.  The FCC has clarified that the value of in-kind contribution requirements set forth in cable franchises is subject to the statutory cap on franchise fees, and it reaffirmed that state and local authorities are barred from imposing franchise fees on revenues derived from non-cable services, such as Internet services, provided by cable operators over cable systems.    \n\nA number of states have adopted franchising laws that provide for state-issued franchising.  Generally, state-issued cable franchises are for a fixed term (or in perpetuity), streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirements and eliminate local negotiation and enforcement of terms.\n\nThe Communications Act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals.  If we fail to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or our liquidity.  Similarly, if a franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the franchising authority may attempt to deny the transaction or impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. \n\nInternet Service\n\nThe FCC originally classified broadband Internet access services, such as those we offer, as an “information service,” which exempted the service from traditional communications common carrier laws and regulations.  In 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access services as “telecommunications service” and, on that basis, imposed a number of “net neutrality” rules governing the provision of broadband service.  In 2017, the FCC eliminated the 2015 rules other than a transparency requirement that obligates us to disclose performance statistics and other service information to consumers.  In 2024, the FCC once again reclassified our Internet access services as telecommunications services.  The industry challenged the Order in court, and on January 2, 2025, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision invalidating the reclassification and the rules contained in the FCC’s Order.  It is also possible that the new Administration and Congress could adopt different requirements applicable to our Internet access services.  The application of new legal requirements to our Internet services could adversely affect our business.\n\nIn 2024, we became subject to new requirements to post standardized labels disclosing our network management policies and performance of our broadband Internet access services, similar to the format of food nutrition labels, for each of our currently available consumer Internet offerings. \n\nThe 2017 FCC decision reclassifying Internet access services also ruled that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to federal network neutrality obligations that the FCC eliminated, but this blanket prohibition was vacated by a federal Court of Appeals in 2019.  The court left open the possibility that individual state laws could be deemed preempted on a case-by-case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law.  Several states have adopted rules similar to the network neutrality requirements that were eliminated by the FCC, and the California rules were upheld in federal court.  \n\n16\n\nCalifornia has also adopted other regulations, including network resiliency rules to assure backup power is available after natural disasters and other outages, and it is considering the imposition of licensing requirements and service quality metrics on Internet service providers.  New York adopted legislation that would require Internet service providers to offer a discounted Internet service to qualifying low-income consumers.  A federal district judge enjoined enforcement as likely to be deemed rate regulation of Internet service that would be preempted by federal law, but that injunction was reversed by a federal Court of Appeals.  On December 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied certiorari for the appeal of that decision.  The rules became enforceable by the Attorney General of New York on January 15, 2025.  We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal, what other legislation and regulations may be adopted by states, or how challenges to such requirements will be resolved.  \n\nIn October 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) adopted rules that would make it easier and faster for consumers to terminate subscription services, including all our services. These rules have been challenged in federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of those challenges.  The application of these rules could adversely affect our business.\n\nIn November 2023, the FCC adopted new rules governing digital discrimination, pursuant to The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (the “IIJA”), to prevent discrimination of access to broadband Internet services. Most of these rules have become effective, but they are subject to ongoing legal challenges and could be modified or rescinded by the FCC in the new Administration.  California adopted digital discrimination rules in November 2024.  We cannot predict the outcome of legal challenges or whether the nature of practices that could be subject to enforcement under these rules could adversely affect our business.\n\nIn recent years, the federal, state and local governments have offered billions of dollars in subsidies to companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “unserved” or “underserved,” using funds from the FCC’s RDOF auction in 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act (2020), The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), and IIJA.  We support such subsidies, provided they are not directed to areas that are already served, and have sought and expect to continue to seek subsidies for our own broadband construction in unserved and underserved areas through programs including RDOF and those created pursuant to ARPA and, if regulatory requirements are reasonable, the IIJA.  We have been awarded over $2 billion in the RDOF auction and other federal, state and municipal grants that will partially fund, along with our substantial additional investment, the construction of new broadband infrastructure to over 1.7 million estimated passings.  Our awards through RDOF and ARPA include a number of regulatory requirements, such as serving as the carrier of last resort and completing increasingly larger portions of the network construction by certain dates. If we fail to meet these obligations, we could be subject to substantial government penalties.\n\nThe FCC has adopted rules for service providers to report broadband availability, pursuant to the Broadband Data Act.  Providers are required to report their service areas twice each year.  The service areas reported are subject to challenge.  A broadband provider who provides inaccurate maps or fails to respond properly to challenges may be subject to enforcement action by the FCC.  The FCC can also fine a provider for filing incorrect maps.   \n\nMobile Service \n\nOur Spectrum Mobile service offers mobile Internet access and telephone service.  We provide this service as a mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) using Verizon’s network and our network through Spectrum WiFi.  As an MVNO, we are subject to many of the same FCC regulations that apply to facilities-based wireless carriers, as well as certain state or local regulations, including (but not limited to): E911, local number portability, customer privacy, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”), Universal Service Fund contributions, robocall mitigation and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirements for mobile devices.   Spectrum Mobile’s broadband Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s transparency rule and broadband labeling rules.  \n\nThe FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile service providers in the future, or impose new taxes or fees applicable to Spectrum Mobile, which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally.  For example, California has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on mobile services.\n\nWireline Voice Service\n\nThe  FCC has never classified the VoIP wireline telephone services we offer as “telecommunications services” that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation, but instead has imposed some of these regulatory requirements on a case-by-case basis, such as requirements relating to 911 emergency services (“E911”), CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications), Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) protections, number portability, network and/or 911 outage reporting, rural call \n\n17\n\ncompletion, disability access, regulatory fees, back-up power, robocall mitigation and discontinuance of service.  It is possible that the FCC or Congress will impose additional federal requirements on our VoIP telephone services in the future.  \n\nOur VoIP telephone services are subject to certain state and local regulatory fees such as E911 fees and contributions to state universal service funds.  Additionally, to comply with RDOF program requirements, we have chosen in the RDOF areas to offer Lifeline VoIP telephone services subject to traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. We also offer Lifeline VoIP telephone services in portions of our California and New York service areas.  Except where we have chosen to offer VoIP telephone services in such a manner, we believe that our VoIP telephone services should be governed primarily by federal regulation.  The federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed our successful challenge to Minnesota's attempt to generally apply telephone regulation to our VoIP services, but that ruling is limited to the seven states in that circuit.  Some states have attempted to subject cable VoIP services, such as our VoIP telephone service, to state level regulation.  California has imposed reporting and other obligations on our VoIP services, including backup power requirements, and has proposed the imposition of service quality metrics on VoIP services.  California has recently adopted an order requiring providers of VoIP services to comply with new registration and/or certification requirements in order to conduct business in the state.  We have registered with or obtained certificates or authorizations from the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which we offer competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of our services.  However, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved.  State regulatory commissions and legislatures may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our fixed wireline voice telephone services.\n\nPrivacy and Information Security Regulation\n\nThe Communications Act limits our ability to collect, use, and disclose customers’ personally identifiable information for our Internet, video, mobile and voice services.  We are subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer information.  All broadband and VoIP providers are also obliged by CALEA to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement, with proper legal process authorized under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, to wiretap and obtain records and information concerning our customers, including the content of their communications.  Further, the FCC, FTC, and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial emails.  The FTC currently has the authority, pursuant to its general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive acts and practices, to protect the privacy of Internet service customers, including our use and disclosure of certain customer information. \n\nOur operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security.  All states have data breach notification laws that would require us to inform individuals and regulators in the event of a breach that could impact personal information of our customers.  In the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures.  The FCC, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations.\n\nVarious security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. We describe those standards in Item 1C. Cybersecurity - Risk Management and Strategy.  The FCC adopted rules expanding its cybersecurity guidelines and requirements.  These rules have been challenged in federal court and we cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the rules could be modified by the new Administration.  The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has sought comment on the development of cyber incident reporting rules, pursuant to 2022 legislative requirements, that require critical infrastructure entities to report substantial cyber incidents within 72 hours of their discovery.\n\nMany states and local authorities have considered legislative or other actions that would impose restrictions on our ability to collect, use and disclose, and safeguard certain consumer information.  Many states have enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws, and some states have enacted issue-specific privacy laws covering health information and children's information.  For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) regulates companies’ collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of California residents and employees and authorizes enforcement actions by the California Attorney General and private class actions for data breaches.  The Maine Act to Protect Privacy of Online Customer Information, which regulates how Internet service providers use and disclose customers’ personal information and requires Internet service providers to take reasonable measures to protect customers’ personal information, became effective on July 1, 2020.  Data privacy laws subsequently have taken effect in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, and Utah, and are scheduled to become effective in Tennessee on July 1, 2025, Minnesota on July 31, 2025, Maryland on October 1, 2025, and Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island on January 1, 2026.  \n\n18\n\nEach of these laws will regulate the way that companies collect, use, and share personal information about consumers.  Other state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation, and states with newly passed laws continue to consider amendments, that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business.  \n\nThe FTC has an ongoing Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to explore rules related to the collection, analysis, and monetization of consumers' information, as well as companies’ data security practices and related disclosures to consumers.  The FTC has also warned companies not to misuse consumers’ biometric information, with a broad definition of biometrics similar to Washington’s My Health My Data Act and the CCPA that treat biometrics as sensitive consumer information, and Illinois and Texas have also adopted laws regulating the use of such information.  The new Congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligations that could supplement or preempt state privacy laws.  \n\nWe cannot predict whether any of the above efforts will be successful, challenged, upheld, vacated, or preempted, or how new legislation and regulations, if any, would affect our business.\n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 94,500 active full-time equivalent employees.  The vast majority of our employees sell or service our products. We believe that attracting, developing and retaining our highly-skilled workforce is critical to successfully executing our operating strategy. With competitive wages, robust and affordable healthcare benefits, a generous retirement program with company match, and opportunities for job training and advancement, our employees develop skills and expertise necessary to build a long and successful career with us.  In addition, the diversity of the communities we serve is reflected in our workforce, which is a critical part of our success in serving these communities. We value the unique backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences of our employees. Embracing these differences brings us together for the common mission of exceeding our customers’ needs.  There are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent, including:  \n\nRewarding Our Employees Competitively and Fairly\n\n•We provide compensation packages that are market competitive, taking into account the location and responsibilities of the role. \n\n•All hourly employees have a starting minimum wage of at least $20 per hour, which is well above any state or federal minimum wage level. \n\n•Over 80% of our employees are eligible for additional variable compensation based on their performance, including annual bonus eligibility for all frontline supervisors and other salaried employees not already on a sales commission or bonus plan.\n\n•We provide high-quality, comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time and part-time employees. It is our priority to keep this coverage affordable for our employees and their families, and so for the last twelve years, we have absorbed the full premium cost increase for medical, dental, and vision coverage.\n\n•We provide competitive financial benefits to all employees such as a 401(k) Plan with a dollar-for-dollar company match up to 6% of their eligible pay.  In addition, most of our employees are also eligible to receive an additional non-elective contribution to a Retirement Accumulation Plan equal to 3% of their eligible pay.\n\n•We have a stock incentive plan and grant equity awards to eligible employees on an annual basis.\n\nDeveloping Our Workforce to Deliver the Best in Customer Experience\n\n•The substantial skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and our training of our customer-facing employees benefit our operations and performance. We offer thousands of learning experiences spanning leadership development, new hire, and professional skills training both online and in the classroom.\n\n•We offer a tuition-free degree and certificate program, removing the financial barrier for employees to continue their education through convenient online learning.\n\n•We also provide traditional tuition reimbursement of up to $10,000 per year for employees who want to pursue other outside programs.\n\n•Most of our customer-facing roles have the opportunity for upward advancement including through supervisory and leadership roles. Our Field Operations organization has a formalized self-progression structure where employees who maintain exceptional levels of performance can complete online coursework to advance to next level within their job family. \n\n•Our Broadband Technician Apprenticeship Program is one of our promising strategies for building our skilled workforce. This program, certified by the U.S. Department of Labor, is aligned with our broadband technician career progression and \n\n19\n\nincludes thousands of hours of on-the-job training along with classroom instruction. When enrolled employees complete the program, they become certified broadband technicians.\n\n•We conduct annual talent planning to review the overall performance of our leaders and their potential to serve in larger, more complex roles. Executive leadership reviews the results of talent conversations, which open possibilities for career growth opportunities and cross-organizational movement. \n\nReflecting the Communities We Serve\n\n•Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is based on our objective to reflect the markets, communities, and customers we serve, enabling us to deliver high-quality products and services that exceed our customers’ expectations, as well as foster an inclusive environment where all employees can thrive and have a long-term career with the company. \n\n•We have five Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) focused on people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, employees with multicultural backgrounds, veterans and women. Open to all employees, these voluntary groups enable employees to engage in activities that support our culture of inclusion and contribute to business success. Our BRGs have empowered our team members to grow and succeed by providing networking, mentorship and skill-building opportunities for anyone who chooses to join.\n\n•Several initiatives promote inclusion and belonging in our workplace including the BRGs, educational opportunities that build the skills and competency of leaders to foster diverse and inclusive teams, as well as additional communications tools and resources.\n\n•Our efforts are guided by an external advisory council and an internal steering committee, with annual reporting to the Board of Directors.",

      "text": "Item 1A.     Risk Factors. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\n\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, access to better financing and greater and more favorable brand name recognition. Increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and content industries have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale including the ability to launch new products and services.\n\nOur Internet service faces competition from other companies’ FTTH, cell phone home Internet service, Internet delivered via satellite and DSL services. Various operators offer wireless Internet services delivered over networks which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speeds and also continue to expand 5G mobile services.  Our mobile and voice services compete with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers.\n\nOur video service faces competition from a number of sources, including DBS services, and companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices often with password sharing among multiple users and security that makes content susceptible to piracy.  Newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content may continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that we face.\n\nThe increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us. We compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as online media, radio and print.  Competition related to our service offerings to businesses continues to increase as well, as more companies deploy more fiber to more buildings, which may negatively impact our growth and put pressure on margins.  \n\nA failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies (including those that use artificial intelligence (“AI”)) and changes in customer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customers and, as a result, affect our business and results of operations.  Competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our \n\n20\n\nfranchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.  For additional information regarding the competition we face, see “Item 1. Business - Competition” and “- Regulation and Legislation.” \n\nVarious events could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.\n\nNetwork and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, both for our internal uses, such as network management, and supplying services to our customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, malicious cyber activities by nation-state threat actors, “cyber attacks” such as ransomware, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks.  Both unsuccessful and successful “cyber attacks” on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years, and the increasing use of AI may intensify these cybersecurity risks. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. We, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.  While from time to time attempts have been made to access our network, these events have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our network and information systems.\n\nOur network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\n\nWe have experienced many of these events and may experience additional events in the future.  Any of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, us or technologies upon which we depend, have had and could in the future have adverse consequences on our network, our customers and our business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers’ equipment and data.  Large expenditures and substantial resources have been and may in the future be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future.  Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches has not always been and may not in the future be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that have resulted and may result.  Any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue.  Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. We provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.\n\nWe process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including the personal information of our customers.  Ongoing increases in the potential for misuse of personal information, the public’s awareness of the importance of safeguarding personal information, and the volume of legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information have resulted in increases to our information-related risks. We could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage our reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue. We could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. We also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.\n\nWe depend on third-party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services and execute our network evolution and rural construction initiatives. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors and service providers represent \n\n21\n\nour sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. Our ability to provide some services and complete our network evolution and rural construction initiatives might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might interrupt or delay our ability to serve existing and new customers, if any of these parties experience or engage in the following:\n\n•breach or terminate or elect not to renew their agreements with us or otherwise fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner;\n\n•demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity;\n\n•tariffs are imposed that impact vendors’ ability to perform their obligations or significantly increase the amount we pay;\n\n•experience operating or financial difficulties;\n\n•experience network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions or security breaches;\n\n•significantly increase the amount we are required to pay (including demands for substantial non-monetary compensation) for necessary products or services; or  \n\n•cease production or providing necessary software updates of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner at our specifications and at reasonable prices. \n\nIn addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.\n\nAny failure to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. From time to time, we may pursue strategic initiatives to launch products or enhancements to our products.  Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers’ changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors.  We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by our competitors, if technologies or equipment on which we have chosen to rely cease to be available to us on reasonable terms or conditions, if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, if we are not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, or if we are no longer able to make our services available to our customers on a third-party device on which a substantial number of customers have relied to access our services, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.\n\nThe ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors’ product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer, at no additional charge or at a lower price, certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium. In addition, the uncertainty of our ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.\n\nAny failure to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, as we continue to grow our mobile services using virtual network operator rights from a third party, we expect continued growth-related sales and marketing and other customer acquisition costs.  We also continue to consider and pursue opportunities in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint ventures or partnerships with wireless or cable providers which may require significant investment.  For example, we now hold CBRS PALs to support existing and future mobile services.  These licenses are subject to revocation and expiration.  Although we expect to be able to maintain and renew these licenses, the loss of one or more licenses could significantly impair our ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reductions.  If we are unable to continue to grow our mobile business and achieve the outcomes we expect from our investments in the mobile business, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n22\n\nOur business may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.\n\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we both develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However, any of our intellectual property rights, or the rights of our suppliers, could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. Infringement claims continue to be brought frequently in the communications and entertainment industries, and we are also often a party to such litigation alleging that certain of our services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe may not have the ability to pass on to our customers all of the increases in programming costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.\n\nProgramming costs are one of our largest expense items. Our programming costs have historically increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. While decreases in video customers combined with a change in the mix of customers choosing lower cost packages have offset total programming cost increases, we expect contractual programming rates per service subscriber to continue to increase as a result of annual increases pursuant to our programming contracts and contract renewals with programmers. Although we pass along amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission consent to the majority of our customers, the inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. In order to mitigate impacts to our operating margins due to increasing programming rates, we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategies.  Further, some programmers have begun to simulcast and/or move popular programming to programmer streaming applications which has created a competitive alternative to our video subscription at lower price points that could, in turn, result in customer losses.  We have sought to obtain and will continue to seek to obtain access to many of these programmer streaming applications, where applicable, as we renew agreements, so that we may include in our customers’ video subscriptions and/or sell to broadband customers for a share of revenue.\n\nIncreases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for local broadcast station retransmission-consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in our programming costs over the last several years. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime. When a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, we are not allowed to carry the station’s signal without that station’s permission. In retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nOur programming contracts are generally for a fixed period of time, with potentially significant spend subject to negotiated renewal in any particular year.  We will seek to renew these agreements on terms that we believe are favorable.  There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms.  To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. Any failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customers could adversely impact our customer levels, operations and financial results.\n\nIssues related to the development and use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n\nWe currently incorporate AI technology in certain parts of our business operations. Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks, challenges and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers’ adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI \n\n23\n\ntechnologies are complex and rapidly evolving. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI-related issues, deficiencies or failures could give rise to legal or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI or as a result of new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property and other laws, and could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n\nOur exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. If there were a prolonged general economic downturn, we may experience increased cancellations or non-payment by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased.  This may include an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with Internet-delivered or over-air content, as well as an increase in the number of Internet and voice customers substituting mobile data and voice products for wireline services, which would negatively impact our ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue.  In addition, our ability to gain new customers is dependent to some extent on growth in occupied housing in our service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions.  Weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on our advertising revenue. These events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to continue.\n\nIn addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. Further, inflationary pressures may impact the ability of vendors and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us.  Any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.\n\nIf we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. Our ability to hire and retain key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications and technology industries. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.\n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\nWe have a significant amount of debt and expect to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to react to changes in our business.\n\nWe have a significant amount of debt and expect to (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future as Charter maintains its stated objective of 4.0 to 4.5 times Adjusted EBITDA leverage (net debt divided by the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA). As of December 31, 2024, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $93.8 billion and Charter's leverage ratio was 4.13 times Adjusted EBITDA.    \n\nOur significant amount of debt could have adverse consequences, such as:\n\n•impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;\n\n•make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, in part because approximately 11% of our borrowings as of December 31, 2024 were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\n•expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;\n\n•require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\n•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;\n\n•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and\n\n•adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.\n\n24\n\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including to refinance and/or in connection with the assumption of indebtedness of Liberty Broadband and/or its subsidiaries after the completion of the merger.  To the extent our current debt amounts increase more than expected, our operating results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade our debt thereby increasing our costs of borrowing and potentially limiting our access to investment grade markets, the related risks that we now face will intensify.\n\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.\n\nThe indentures governing the CCO Holdings, LLC (“CCO Holdings”) notes contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, CCO Holdings, CCO Holdings Capital Corp. and all of their restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:\n\n•incur additional debt;\n\n•pay dividends on equity or repurchase equity;\n\n•make investments;\n\n•sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\n•sell assets;\n\n•in the case of restricted subsidiaries, create or permit to exist dividend or payment restrictions with respect to CCO Holdings, guarantee their parent companies’ debt, or issue specified equity interests; \n\n•engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\n•grant liens (with respect to only CCO Holdings).\n\nAdditionally, the Charter Communications Operating, LLC (“Charter Operating”) credit facilities require Charter Operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. The Charter Operating credit facilities, the Charter Operating notes, the Time Warner Cable, LLC (“TWC, LLC”) senior notes and debentures, and the Time Warner Cable Enterprises, LLC (“TWCE”) debentures include customary negative covenants, including restrictions on the ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and consolidating, merging or conveying or transferring substantially all of the respective obligor’s assets.  The breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under our secured notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in substantially all of our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.\n\nRisks Related to Ownership Position of Liberty Broadband Corporation and Advance/Newhouse Partnership\n\nLiberty Broadband and A/N have governance rights that give them influence over corporate transactions and other matters.\n\nLiberty Broadband currently owns a significant amount of Charter Class A common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to Charter.  A/N currently owns Charter Class A common stock and a significant amount of membership interests in our subsidiary, Charter Holdings, which are convertible into Charter Class A common stock, and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to Charter. Members of Charter’s Board of Directors include a director who is a former officer and director of Liberty Broadband and directors who are current or former officers and directors of A/N. Mr. Greg Maffei is the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Broadband. Steven Miron is the Chief Executive Officer of A/N and Michael Newhouse is co-president of the parent of A/N and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2024, Liberty Broadband beneficially held approximately 28.58% of Charter’s voting stock and A/N beneficially held approximately 12.40% of Charter’s voting stock. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement among Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, dated as of May 23, 2015 (the “Existing Stockholders Agreement”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement and the Letter Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2024 (the “Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment”), Liberty Broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for Charter’s Board of Directors and A/N currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for Charter’s Board of Directors.  Each of A/N and Liberty Broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of Charter’s Board of Directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of A/N and Liberty Broadband, and provided that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from A/N, Liberty Broadband and Charter (referred to as the “unaffiliated directors” in the Existing Stockholders Agreement).\n\n25\n\nThe Existing Stockholders Agreement and Charter’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation fixes the size of the board at 13 directors. Liberty Broadband and A/N are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Class B common stock for the director nominees nominated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including the respective designees of Liberty Broadband and A/N, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, Liberty Broadband and A/N must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than A/N and Liberty Broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors.  As a result of their rights under the Existing Stockholders Agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in Charter, Liberty Broadband and/or A/N, who may have interests different from those of other stockholders, will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of Charter, including the approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.\n\nThe Existing Stockholders Agreement provides A/N and Liberty Broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of Charter equity in connection with certain transactions, and in the event that A/N or Liberty Broadband exercises these rights, holders of Charter Class A common stock may experience further dilution.\n\nThe Existing Stockholders Agreement provides that A/N and Liberty Broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of Charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions. Holders of Charter Class A common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions. As a result, if Liberty Broadband and/or A/N elect to exercise their preemptive rights, (i) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of Charter Class A common stock, and (ii) such other holders of Charter Class A common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in Charter upon such exercise.\n\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters\n\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nThe services we offer are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can increase operational and administrative expenses and reduce revenues, including those covering the following:\n\n•the provision of high-speed Internet service, including regulating the price for low-income customers, network management, broadband label, broadband availability reporting, digital discrimination and transparency rules;\n\n•the provision of fixed and mobile voice communications, including rules for emergency communications, network and/or 911 outage reporting, CPNI safeguards and reporting, local number portability, efforts to limit unwanted robocalls, and, for mobile devices, hearing aid compatibility, safety and emission requirements;\n\n•the fees that must be included in our advertised prices and bills, and the means by which our customers can cancel services;\n\n•access by law enforcement;\n\n•cable franchise renewals and transfers;\n\n•the provisioning, marketing and billing of cable, telephone and Internet equipment;\n\n•cybersecurity protection and practices, including customer and employee privacy and data security;\n\n•copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;\n\n•the circumstances when a cable system must carry a broadcast station and the circumstances when it first must obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;\n\n•limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring;\n\n•equal employment opportunity; \n\n•the resiliency of our networks to maintain service during and after disasters and power outages;\n\n•emergency alert systems, disability access, pole attachments, commercial leased access and technical standards;\n\n•marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and\n\n•approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant’s business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.\n\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones.  Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses. \n\n26\n\nChanges to the existing legal and regulatory framework under which we operate or the regulatory programs in which we or our competitors participate could adversely affect our business.\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, particularly our retail broadband Internet access service.  Potential legislative and regulatory changes could adversely impact our business by increasing our costs and competition and limiting our ability to offer services in a manner that would maximize our revenue potential.  These changes have in the past, and could in the future, include, for example, the reclassification of Internet services as regulated telecommunications services or other utility-style regulation of Internet services; restrictions on how we manage our Internet access services and networks; the adoption of new customer service or service quality requirements for our Internet access services; the adoption of new privacy restrictions on our collection, use and disclosure of certain customer information; new data security and cybersecurity mandates that could result in additional network and information security and cyber incident reporting requirements for our business; new restraints on our discretion over programming decisions; new restrictions on the rates we charge to consumers for one or more of the services or equipment options we offer, including our ability to offer promotions; changes to the cable industry’s compulsory copyright to retransmit broadcast signals; new requirements to assure the availability of navigation devices from third-party providers; new Universal Service Fund contribution obligations on our Internet service revenues that would add to the cost of that service; increases in government-administered broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our facilities; changes to the FCC’s administration of spectrum; and changes in the regulatory framework for VoIP telephone service, including the scope of regulatory obligations associated with our VoIP telephone service and our ability to interconnect our VoIP telephone service with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications service. \n\nAs a winning bidder in the FCC’s RDOF auction in 2020, we must comply with numerous FCC and state requirements to continue receiving such funding. To comply with these requirements, in RDOF areas, we have chosen to offer certain of our VoIP telephone services, such as our Lifeline services, subject to certain traditional federal and state common carrier regulations. Additionally, in some areas where we are building pursuant to subsidy programs, we will offer certain of our broadband Internet access services subject to required discounts and other marketing-related terms. If we fail to comply with those requirements, the governing regulatory agency could consider us in default and we could incur substantial penalties or forfeitures. If we fail to attain certain specified infrastructure build-out requirements under the RDOF program, the FCC could also withhold future support payments until those shortcomings are corrected. Any failure to comply with the rules and requirements of a subsidy grant could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn 2024, one federal Court of Appeals decision found multiple constitutional violations in the FCC’s system for funding and administering its Universal Service programs.  Two other Courts of Appeals had upheld the FCC’s rules.  The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the FCC’s appeal of the adverse decision.  We cannot predict the outcome of this case or any related actions of the Congress and FCC, which could adversely affect our receipt of universal service funds, including but not limited to FCC RDOF grants to expand our network, FCC E-rate funds to serve schools and libraries and FCC Rural Health Care funds to serve eligible health care providers.\n\nOur current and past participation in state and federal programs that subsidize network construction in high-cost areas and service to schools or low-income consumers, and the provision of services to government agencies or entities, creates the risk of claims of our failure to adequately comply with the regulatory requirements of those programs or contracts. The FCC, and various state and federal agencies and attorney generals, may subject those programs, or other industry practices, to audits and investigations, which could result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements or reputational harm, and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on us, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf any laws or regulations are enacted that would expand the regulation of our services, they could affect our operations and require significant expenditures. We cannot predict future developments in these areas, and any changes to the regulatory framework for our Internet, video, mobile or VoIP services could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIt remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by Congress, the FCC, the FTC and state legislatures, and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us, including on the operation of our broadband networks, customer privacy and the user experience.  \n\n27\n\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax and fee positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe offer services and operate cable systems in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. From time to time, legislative and administrative bodies change laws and regulations that change our effective tax rate or tax payments.  Many of the provisions enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of 2025.  The Administration and Congress are actively considering various policy choices which may have the impact of changing, possibly materially, how Charter is taxed in comparison to how we are taxed today and potentially in comparison to our competitors.  Certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. Potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, changes to income tax sourcing rules and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities.  In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\n\nOur cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination and are non-exclusive. The failure to renew a franchise or the grant of additional franchises in one or more service areas could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.\n\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisors have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more service areas could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.\n\nOur cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms. \n\nRisks Related to the Liberty Broadband Combination\n\nThe combination is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all.  Failure to complete the combination could have material adverse effects on us.\n\nThe completion of the combination is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (i) the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, Liberty Broadband Series B common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock entitled to vote on the Liberty Broadband merger proposal at the Liberty Broadband special meeting, voting together as a single class; (ii) the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Liberty Broadband Series A common stock, Liberty Broadband Series B common stock and Liberty Broadband preferred stock entitled to vote on the Liberty Broadband merger proposal at the Liberty Broadband special meeting, beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Liberty Broadband stockholders (other than certain affiliated stockholders), voting together as a single class, which condition cannot be waived; (iii) the approval of the share issuance proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Charter common stock at the Charter special meeting; (iv) the approval of the Charter merger proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Charter common stock entitled to vote on the proposal at the Charter special meeting, beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Charter stockholders (other than certain affiliated stockholders), voting together as a single class, which condition cannot be waived; (v) to the extent applicable, any waiting period (and any \n\n28\n\nextension thereof), and any commitments by the parties not to close before a certain date under a timing agreement entered into with a governmental authority, in each case, in respect of the combination or the conversion of the Liberty Broadband capital stock pursuant to the merger agreement under the HSR Act having expired or been granted early termination; (vi) no stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order having been initiated by the SEC and not rescinded with respect to the registration statement on Form S-4, which contains a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025; (vii) authorization of listing on the Nasdaq of the shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter rollover preferred stock to be issued in connection with the merger; (viii) the absence of any law, order, or other legal restraint or prohibition, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, which prevents, prohibits, renders illegal or enjoins the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (ix) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the merger agreement, subject to certain materiality qualifications; (x) each party’s performance, in all material respects, with its covenants required to be performed by it under the merger agreement prior to the closing of the combination; (xi) in respect of Charter’s obligation to effect the closing, the completion of the GCI divestiture; and (xii) each party’s receipt of a tax opinion, to the effect that, inter alia, the combination will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.    \n\nWhile the parties have agreed in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to satisfy the closing conditions, the parties may not be successful in their efforts to do so.  The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent completion from occurring at all.  Any delay in completing the combination could cause Charter not to realize some or all of the benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected, that Charter expects to achieve if the combination is successfully completed within the expected timeframe.  There can be no assurance that the conditions in the merger agreement will be satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived or that the combination will be completed.  In addition, subject to limited exceptions, either Charter or Liberty Broadband may terminate the merger agreement if the combination has not been consummated by August 31, 2027 or such other date as mutually agreed. \n\nIf the combination is not completed, we may be materially adversely affected, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the combination, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n•the market price of Charter common stock could decline;\n\n•we could owe a substantial termination fee to Liberty Broadband under certain circumstances;\n\n•if the merger agreement is terminated and we seek another business combination, we may not find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms comparable to or more attractive than the terms agreed to in the merger agreement;\n\n•time and resources, financial and other, committed by us and our subsidiaries’ management to matters relating to the combination could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\n•we and our subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers, regulators or employees;\n\n•we will be required to pay our costs relating to the combination, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing and mailing fees, whether or not the combination is completed;\n\n•we are subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the effective time, as set forth in the merger agreement, which may prevent us from making certain acquisitions or taking other actions during the pendency of the combination; and\n\n•reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the combination.\n\nIn addition, if the combination is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the combination or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.  Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, financial results and stock price.\n\nWe are subject to contractual restrictions while the combination is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Charter is subject to a limited set of restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to the effective time. Such limitations may affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to amend our organizational documents, issue shares of capital stock or pay extraordinary dividends or distributions, which could adversely affect us prior to the effective time.  Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the combination.  \n\n29\n\nThe announcement and pendency of the combination could divert the attention of management and cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nOur management may be required to divert a disproportionate amount of attention away from our day-to-day activities and operations and devote time and effort to consummating the combination.  The risks, and adverse effects, of such disruptions and diversions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the combination.  These factors could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations, regardless of whether the combination is completed.\n\nWe will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the combination.\n\nWe will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the combination, including advisory, legal and other transaction costs, and, following the completion of the combination, we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with combining the companies.  A majority of these costs have already been incurred or will be incurred regardless of whether the combination is completed.  Factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.  Our management continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the combination.  Although we expect that the realization of benefits related to the combination will offset such costs and expenses over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.\n\nIf repurchases of Liberty Broadband’s shares of Charter Class A common stock during the pendency of the combination are not consummated on the agreed terms, or otherwise fail to meet the intended objectives, there could be adverse effects on the companies and the combination.\n\nThe Stockholders and Letter Agreement Amendment modifies the terms set forth in the existing letter agreement with respect to Liberty Broadband’s participation in Charter’s share repurchase program during the pendency of the combination. The repurchases of Liberty Broadband’s shares of Charter Class A common stock during such period are intended to facilitate the repayment by Liberty Broadband of certain of its outstanding indebtedness and to allow Liberty Broadband to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its ongoing operations during the pendency of the combination. If the repurchases are not consummated on the agreed terms, or otherwise fail to meet the intended objectives, there could be adverse effects on the financial position of each of Liberty Broadband and Charter and on the combination.\n\nCharter may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the combination or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\n\nThe full benefits of the combination may not be realized as expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.  Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the combination could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the combination, and negatively impact the price of our common stock.  In addition, there may be liabilities that Charter underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing its due diligence investigation of Liberty Broadband.\n\nThe combination raises other risks.\n\nThe pending combination with Liberty Broadband raises additional risks not described above.  For additional information, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the combination, filed by Charter on January 22, 2025, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Where You Can Find More Information” included therein.",
