      "text": "ITEM 1. Business.\n\nOverview\n\nHP is a global technology leader and creator of solutions that enable people to bring their ideas to life and connect to the things that matter most. Operating in more than 170 countries, HP delivers innovative and sustainable devices, services and subscriptions for personal computing, printing, 3D printing, hybrid work, gaming and other related technologies.\n\nWe believe artificial intelligence (“AI”) is playing a critical role in the transformation of how people live and work, and customers are beginning to recognize the benefits in security, speed and cost. Our high-performing product portfolio includes HP’s new line of AI PCs and workstations built with the computing power to enable local AI processing for enhanced performance and features as well as intelligent print features incorporated into our home, office and graphics solutions.\n\nOur broad range of security capabilities are designed to protect an increasingly distributed user base through security enhanced PCs and printers, hardware-enforced endpoint security software (for both HP and non-HP PCs), and endpoint security services. Our security solutions provide layered resiliency using enhanced features such as containment and isolation technology as well as the use of AI deep-learning to identify and remove malware threats.\n\nWe have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments.\n\nPersonal Systems\n\nPersonal Systems offers desktops, notebooks, and workstations (including HP’s portfolio of AI PCs and workstations), thin clients, retail point-of-sale (“POS”) systems, displays, hybrid systems, software, solutions including endpoint security and services. We provide lifecycle services including support and deployment, configurations, and extended warranty services. We support a multi-operating system and multi-architecture strategy, primarily using Microsoft Windows and Google Chrome operating systems. Our platforms incorporate processors from Intel, and AMD, including integrated AI acceleration, as well as NVIDIA GPUs for advanced graphics and compute workloads. \n\nPersonal Systems groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:\n\n•Commercial PS consists of endpoint computing devices and hybrid systems, for use by enterprise, public sector (which includes education), and small- and medium-sized business (“SMB”) customers. These devices include our Pro and Elite commercial PC portfolio, our Z line of workstations, thin clients, retail POS systems, and HP’s Dragonfly and Chromebook PCs. HP offers a range of secure services and solutions to commercial customers to help them manage the lifecycle of their PCs and mobility installed base.\n\n•    Consumer PS consists of devices, accessories and services which are designed for consumer usage, focusing on gaming, learning and working remotely, consuming multi-media for entertainment, managing personal life activities, sharing information and staying connected, informed, and secure. These devices include our new Omni consumer PC portfolio, the Omen and Victus gaming lines, and HP’s Spectre, Envy, Pavilion and Chromebook PCs.\n\nPrinting\n\nPrinting provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, services and solutions. Printing is also focused on Graphics and 3D Printing and Personalization in the commercial and industrial markets. Our global business capabilities within Printing are described below:\n\n•Office Printing Solutions delivers HP’s security enhanced office printers, supplies, services, and solutions to SMBs, public sector and large enterprises.

HP offers complete solutions in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners.\n\nPrinting groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:\n\n•Commercial Printing consists of office printing solutions, graphics solutions and 3D printing and personalization, excluding supplies;\n\n•Consumer Printing consists of home printing solutions, excluding supplies; and\n\n•Supplies comprises a set of highly innovative consumable products, ranging from ink and laser cartridges to media, industrial graphics supplies and 3D printing and personalization supplies, for recurring use in consumer and commercial hardware.\n\nCorporate Investments\n\nCorporate Investments includes certain business incubation projects and investments in digital enablement.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service, support and solutions including subscription-based offerings and financing, security, availability of application software, and our sustainable impact. \n\nThe markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively based on the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\n\nThe competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below:\n\nPersonal Systems. The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions. Our primary competitors are Acer Inc., Apple Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Dell Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Lenovo Group Limited, Logitech International S.A., Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation. In certain geographies, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or “white box” manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, our innovative design work, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings, the accessibility of our products and the execution of our broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\n\nPrinting. The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing’s key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Brother Industries, Ltd., Canon Inc., Pantum International Limited, Seiko Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd., and Xerox Corporation Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer non-original supplies (including imitation, refill and remanufactured alternatives), which are often available for lower prices, but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to HP original inkjet and toner supplies. These and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers, retailers or distributors, or such resellers, retailers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high-quality solutions for the home, office and publishing environments, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, sustainability, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\n\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\n\nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups, and sales of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners, utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two, including:\n\n•retailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and SMBs;\n\n•resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\n\n•distribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers and retailers in certain geographies; and\n\n•system integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services, including systems integration work and as-a-service solutions, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services.\n\nThe majority of our overall revenue is made through channel resellers, however, the mix of our revenue generation conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market. We believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and sub-geographic specificities for each of our businesses. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market. Our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers. For other customers and for consumers, we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships, whereby retailers mainly target consumers and SMBs and commercial resellers mainly target SMBs, mid-market accounts, public sector and large enterprises.\n\nManufacturing and Materials\n\nWe utilize outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture HP-designed products to generate cost efficiencies, reduce time to market, and maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. We also manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.\n\nWe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. Building products to order maximizes manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables products to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements. Additionally, while most of our products have existing or readily available alternative sources of supply, in some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, our components are obtained from a single source or limited number of sources if we believe it is advantageous to do so based on technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. \n\nResearch and Development\n\nInnovation across products, services, business models and processes is a key element of our culture and success. We are focused on developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires, and emerging technological trends, including accelerating the delivery of AI throughout our product portfolio. We continue to invest in innovation in both the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where strategic partnerships will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe seek patent protection for inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will maintain or improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 2025, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 16,000 patents which expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. \n\nWe believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is essential to HP as a whole or to any of HP’s business segments.\n\nIn addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property (“IP”) from third parties. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses, and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.\n\n7\n\n\nSeasonality\n\nWe experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Historical seasonal patterns may be impacted by supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of macroeconomic challenges.\n\nSustainable Impact Activities\n\nAt HP, we believe how we do things is just as important as what we do. Our Sustainable Impact strategy focuses on empowering customers, enhancing our value chain, and advancing societal impact. For more information on our sustainability strategy and performance, see our annual Sustainable Impact Report, available on our website (which is not incorporated by reference herein).\n\nEnvironment\n\nOur operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. \n\nWe proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment.  \n\nWe are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. This commitment is reflected and outlined in our Sustainable Impact goals, our comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nHP employs approximately 55,000 employees worldwide. Together, they power HP’s innovation and perspectives to create breakthrough technologies and transformative solutions that we believe will drive our long-term success. We strive to attract, retain and advance exceptional talent by providing engaging work experiences that help our employees thrive. To deliver on these priorities, HP senior leaders are accountable for meeting management objectives for employee engagement and leadership development. \n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nWe regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their workplace experiences and to identify ways to strengthen our culture. We take action to address their ideas, suggestions, and concerns collected through our employee surveys and pulse polls and continue to be certified as a Great Place to Work. \n\nTalent Development\n\nWe have a multi-faceted talent, learning, and skill-development strategy. We emphasize different backgrounds, experience, and perspectives in our senior talent pipeline and invest in targeted approaches such as leadership assessments, external education opportunities, coaching, job rotations, and immersive, experiential learning to ensure our executives are equipped to lead HP, both now and in the future. We also support employees through an extensive portfolio of internal and external development programs designed to accelerate career growth and enhance technical and digital capabilities. Additionally, we prepare new people managers with development experiences designed, among other things, to build coaching skills and foster trust and belonging.\n\nIn addition to skill development resources, HP also offers formal education assistance through our Degree Assistance Program which provides employees with the opportunity to participate in higher academic education.\n\nInclusion\n\nInnovation at HP comes from the different perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences of our employees that make up our globally connected workforce. We aim for an inclusive workforce that allows us to remain responsive to the marketplace, driving innovation to meet their evolving needs.\n\nSupported by leadership, the company’s global inclusion strategy focuses on locally implemented processes, while maintaining organizational consistency with policies, practices, and services. Programs, strategic partnerships, and Business Resource Groups are key components of our strategy to attract, develop, and retain talent and provide the foundation for a positive culture of inclusion and respect.\n\nPay Equity\n\nPeople should be paid equitably for their work, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and \n\n8\n\n\nperformance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to help ensure our pay is fair and equitable.\n\nSince 2016, we also have reviewed employees’ compensation with independent third-party experts to support equitable pay practices. We have expanded our annual pay equity assessment to include additional countries representing a majority of our global workforce. \n\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\n\nHP is committed to the health and safety of our employees through robust training programs, clear communication of standards, and leadership engagement. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess worldwide and regional trends as a part of quarterly reviews. We focus on reducing and effectively managing risks at HP-owned and partner-owned manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe holistic wellbeing of our employees is vital to HP’s success. Our global wellness program is designed to serve the needs of our evolving workforce and culture through opportunities for employees to prioritize wellness across five pillars of well-being: emotional, financial, life balance, physical health, and social and community. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors across the five pillars of wellness through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, personal challenges, and other incentives. In addition, we provide specialized programs and campaigns, all with the help of HP-provided mindfulness apps, targeted mental health support, individual assessments, and expanded financial wellbeing programs. \n\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n\nThe following are our current executive officers:\n\nManpreet S.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be particularly read in conjunction with Part I, Item I, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. \n\nThe risks we describe in this Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.\n\nSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nIf we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.\n\nTo execute our strategy, we must, among other things, optimize our cost structure, make long-term investments, develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property, commit significant research and development and other resources, evolve our go-to-market strategy and business model to meet changing market dynamics, forces and demand. In addition, we need to innovate, develop and execute on evolutionary strategies in a rapidly changing and increasingly hybrid environment, seize on disruptive opportunities and effectively respond to secular trends and shifts in customer preferences. Our financial performance will depend in part on our ability to remain competitive in offerings geared towards new or emerging market trends, such as artificial intelligence, hybrid consumption and digital employee experience.  For example, in fiscal year 2025 we experienced challenges from changing customer behaviors and we believe we and others in our industry face continuing secular challenges related to, among other things, decreased demand for printing products and solutions as a result of increased digitization, hybrid work, increasing competition from generic alternatives and customer preferences shifting from traditional disposable ink cartridge printers to refillable big tank printers. We also  seek to ensure our existing offerings in this space, such as managed services and print software, remain sufficiently differentiated and profitable. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of these challenges, such as by seeking to increase our margin and market share, particularly in big tank printers, and drive demand in software and subscription services or other recurring-revenue based business models, offering higher profitability, may not be successful. While our big tank printers typically have a higher initial margin than our traditional in cartridge printers, they do not result in follow-on sales of high margin traditional ink cartridges and, as a result, may have lower overall device lifetime profitability. Also, shifting to recurring-revenue based business may require us to forego upfront revenue and invest in platforms and systems that enable subscription sales. In addition, we may be unable to successfully execute our strategy, sufficiently invest in, prioritize research and development, market and scale, or accurately project the financial performance of our key growth areas, other strategic growth initiatives and existing offerings, accurately predict technological or business trends or control costs. Moreover, the process of developing new high-technology products, services and solutions and enhancing existing products, services and solutions, including through the introduction of AI capabilities, is complex, costly and uncertain, and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to customers’ changing needs, accurately identify emerging technological trends or accurately project the demand, pricing, or other market dynamics of such trends. Our ability to successfully offer our products, services and solutions in this rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively calibrate and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. This effort includes execution of effective go-to-market plans, which may require us to evolve our talent and capabilities, incentive plans (especially for evolution to recurring revenue business), and coverage models. In addition, we may be unable to appropriately prioritize and balance our initiatives or effectively manage change throughout our organization. \n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation, technological change and customer preferences. Even if we successfully develop new products,  future products, solutions and technologies, including those created by our competitors, may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhancement of our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. As a result, we could lose market share and certain of our products, solutions and technologies may be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.\n\nAfter we develop a product, we must be able to quickly manufacture appropriate volumes while also managing costs and preserving or improving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer and legal requirements, and we may not succeed in doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. Moreover, new products and services may replace or supersede existing offerings and may not be profitable. Even if they are profitable, the operating margins may not be as high as the historical or anticipated margins.\n\nWe expect the proliferation of AI to have a significant impact on our industry and the markets in which we compete, and the development and use of AI presents competitive, reputational, and liability risks.\n\nWe believe the proliferation of AI, especially as it relates to our product and solutions offerings, will continue to have a significant impact on customer preferences and market dynamics in our industry, and our ability to effectively compete in this space will be critical to our financial performance. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. We are working to incorporate AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial products and solutions, as well as across the company in our own internal operations, and our research into and continued development of such technologies remain ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its rate and success of adoption, and therefore our business, and there is no guarantee that our use of AI or incorporation of AI capabilities into our products and solutions will benefit our business operations or result in products and solutions that are preferred by our customers. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to build and support our AI products. If our AI products fail to operate as anticipated or as well as competing products or otherwise do not meet customer needs or if we are unable to bring AI-enabled products and solutions to market as effectively, or with the same speed or in the same volumes, as our competitors, we may fail to recoup our investments in AI or improve our financial performance, our competitive position may be harmed, and our business and reputation may be adversely impacted. For example, the accelerated rate of innovation of components from our suppliers may result in higher defects or failure of our offerings to perform, which could cause us to incur increased warranty costs, inventory provisions or impairments and could impact future sales. Moreover, our actions to drive demand to AI products may result in cannibalization of demand for our traditional, non-AI products, which may result in lower net revenues and/or profit margins. \n\nIn addition, AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. AI models deployed by us or our partners may lead to unexpected or unintended outcomes that could erode trust in our AI products and solutions and potentially cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems, or the use of AI systems, could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and European Union, new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Additionally, our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our products and solutions. Proliferating export controls, including controls on certain rare earth elements, designed to limit the diffusion of advanced technology, can impact speed on AI innovation and capabilities by controlling hardware capable of supporting advanced AI technology. Some AI capabilities also present ethical issues, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. If we enable or offer AI products or solutions or implement AI capabilities in our internal operations that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, the environment, competition, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm or greater employee attrition.\n\nWe are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could adversely affect in the future, our financial results.\n\nWe have at times operated in a supply-constrained environment and have faced, and may face in the future, component shortages, logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and their ability to deliver sufficient key components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and services. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to anticipate and our suppliers’ ability to fulfill, our needs for sufficient key components, products and services (including sourcing matched sets). Given the wide variety of products and services we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems have and could continue to arise in production, planning and inventory management. Third-party suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions, particularly as a result of increased interest rates, emerging market volatility or changes in global trade policies, or global pandemics or other public health crises, and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations. Changes or additions to our supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs, resulting from market dynamics, especially increasing memory and storage costs and potential supply chain constraints in our Personal Systems business, and higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers. Our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit, or if any of our distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain for cost or redundancy could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers and OMs may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us, which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs, jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations, which could in turn, result in a decrease in sales, profitability and cash flows, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. \n\n12\n\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to the following specific supply chain related risks:\n\n•Component shortages. We have at times experienced and may in the future experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, disputes with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, supplier ability to demonstrate regulatory compliance, regulatory or other trade restrictions on specific components in certain markets, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems we face during the transition to new suppliers. For example, a market shortage of integrated circuits and panels and other component supply has at times affected, and may affect in the future, lead times, the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Additionally, our Personal Systems business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture our products and we are therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs. We represent a substantial portion of the business for certain OMs, and changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular OM could adversely affect the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving component products from that OM. Increased demand for particular components due to industry trends, including components required for the operation of AI, may lead to shortages, delays, and price increases. Our anticipation of these and other supply chain dynamics may result in us purchasing components in greater volumes and on earlier schedules in order to secure an adequate supply, which could adversely affect our working capital and cash flow. If shortages or delays in component products occur, the price of certain components may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues, we may be required to change suppliers or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, we may lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers due to such component shortages or delays. If we cannot adequately address a component supply issue, we may have to re-engineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.\n\n•Sourcing inventory planning. In order to secure components for our products or services, we have and may continue to make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability, which could adversely affect our working capital and cash flow. If we fail to anticipate customer demand, an oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components.\n\n•Contractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and may be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same OMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our Personal Systems business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to OMs may create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may create collectability risks. In addition, to secure components, we may accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us. \n\n•Contingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to effectively manage this workforce could adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to manage the costs associated with engaging a contingent workforce may be impacted by evolving local labor laws.\n\n•Working conditions, human rights and materials sourcing. Our brand perception, customer loyalty and legal compliance could be adversely impacted by a supplier’s improper practices or failure to comply with our requirements for  responsible practices and sourcing, including sub-tier sourcing.\n\n•Single-source suppliers. We obtain a significant number of components from a single source due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. For example, we rely on Canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges and certain key suppliers for application specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”). We also rely on Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA, or other suppliers to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for the majority of our PCs and workstations. Some of those processors may be customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained initially from only one source until we have determined whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. For some components, alternative sources may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In certain circumstances, we purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms, but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of, deterioration of our relationship \n\n13\n\n\nwith, or limits in allocation by, a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance. An adverse litigation outcome, including an injunction in an IP litigation, against a single-source supplier, could also significantly impact our ability to make and sell products utilizing that supplier’s components.\n\n•Geographic concentration. Our manufacturing facilities and suppliers have historically been, and continue to be, geographically concentrated in certain regions, which could exacerbate the risks noted above. While we are undertaking initiatives to diversify our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, such initiatives require significant investment and time and have been and can continue to be subject to regulatory, continuity, operational, geopolitical and other hurdles, and there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be successful.\n\n•International trade restrictions. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data have and may continue to,  materially adversely affect our supply chain. The impact has been particularly significant for the restrictive measures that apply to countries and regions where we have significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures have and may continue to  increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require us to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products and services. Changing our business model and supply chain to comply with and seek to offset the impact of new or revised trade restrictions has been, and may continue to be, expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our business, and may not be successful in offsetting or mitigating these impacts. The impact of changes we make in this regard will not be immediate, and, even if successful, we expect it will take time for any offsetting impacts to take full effect. Moreover, such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create additional uncertainty. \n\nOur business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly.\n\nThe success of our services business (such as our managed print and device services, lifecycle services, digital services, consumer subscriptions and other  services and solutions for both Printing and Personal Systems) depends to a significant degree on attracting, retaining, and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from our customers. Our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option and/or subject to early termination rights. We may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our customers, or our customers may reduce the scope of the services for which they contract. Factors that may influence contract termination, non-renewal or reduction include business downturns, dissatisfaction with our services or products, our retirement or lack of support for our services, our customers selecting alternative technologies, the cost of our services as compared to our competitors, general market conditions, a lower than investment grade credit rating or other reasons. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost customers or reductions in services. While our services agreements may include penalties for early termination, these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses. Our customers could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future. In addition, the pricing and other terms of certain services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these contracts, such as increased costs resulting from new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions, which may increase as services become more customized, have in the past made, and could in the future make, these agreements less profitable or unprofitable. Certain service-oriented business models, such as the “device as a service” model under which customers are provided with  a hardware device for a periodic fee within a managed solution that provides professional services, software, support, monitoring and other services, may not generate net new sales for customers who previously purchased our hardware transactionally. The device as a service model also requires the participation of a third-party financing provider, and we may face challenges in finding such providers who are willing to provide financing on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, from time to time we offer new services for which customer demand and adoption rates are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to scale these services as we expect. As a result, we may not generate the revenues, profits or cash flows we may have anticipated from our services business within the expected timelines, if at all.\n\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.\n\nWe encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings, and our sustainability performance. We have faced, and may continue to face, declines in market share for our products. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully, our results of operations, cash flows and business prospects could be affected.\n\nWe have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. Because of the size and scope of our portfolio, we may invest a greater percentage of our revenues, including on research and development, than some of our competitors. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and our competitors may have \n\n14\n\n\ngreater financial, technical and marketing resources available for their products and services, compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services, or greater economies of scale, which could in turn result in our loss of market share. Our actions to mitigate the impact of these dynamics, such as reducing the size of our product portfolio, may not be successful. In addition, if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive pricing pressures, our gross margin, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nOur alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others. In addition, these partners also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. \n\nWe have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive price competition and have lowered and may in the future need to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our market share, revenue and gross margin. Competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and/or more favorable allocations of products and components, have been able to offer and may continue to be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Price competition often increases during periods of lower demand, including as a result of declining macroeconomic conditions. The sales prices for our products may also decline as a result of discounts, a change in or mix of products and services, anticipation of the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors, promotional programs, product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors. We may also provide pricing discounts to large customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which the sales occur. In addition, currency fluctuations, particularly weakness in the Japanese Yen, has and may continue to exacerbate pricing competition for our print products and services.\n\nIndustry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Our competitors may also affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers. Furthermore, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives), which are often available at lower prices, compete with our Printing Supplies business. We may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures, including due to regulatory issues or other legal challenges. In addition, online and omnichannel retailers, resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products, including non-original supplies, or they may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. We expect this competition will continue.\n\nIf we cannot continue to produce high-quality and secure products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer.\n\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services, including potential flaws in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by third-parties. Many of our products and services, including those which incorporate AI capabilities, are dependent on third-party software, including from Microsoft and Google, to function as intended, and product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and software and third-party products and software. Our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in third-party components or materials included in our products, including security vulnerabilities. The products and services that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors, particularly with respect to undiscovered defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties.\n\nIf we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality or security issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments. We have and may again in the future write off some or all of the value of non-performing inventory. In addition, after products are delivered, quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing these issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs. In the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with third-party components, we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation, which may be ineffective. Further, adapting our products and services to meet new regulatory requirements can be costly and cause uncertainties and business disruption. Quality and security issues, including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party components, can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand and reputation events.\n\nThird-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.\n\nWe are subject to third party claims that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon IP rights. We have seen an increasing trend of patent assertion entities and operating companies with licensing businesses engaging in claims of infringement and assertion of patents to extract settlements including the assertion of patents related to standardized technologies, such as Wi-Fi or video. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the increasing use of venues with procedural and substantive rules and practices  more favorable for patent asserters, including the availability of preliminary and permanent injunctions for non-competitors. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed IP at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute technology from another source or disable allegedly IP protected functionality, our operations could be adversely affected. \n\n15\n\n\nEven if we believe that IP claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend  and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. Claims of IP infringement  may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face an injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain products. Additionally, claims of IP infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships.\n\nIn certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from us levies upon IT equipment (such as PCs and printers). There have also been efforts to introduce, modify or extend existing levy schemes and to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. The total amount of the copyright levies depends on several factors, and could be substantial. The ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.\n\nThe terms of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and us include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and us. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and we retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise could also adversely affect our reputation.\n\nOur operating results have historically varied and may not be indicative of future results.\n\nOur net revenue, gross margin, profit and cash flow generation vary among our portfolio of products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely vary in future periods. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue, which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services. We have experienced and may in the future experience delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and could result in a significant decline in net revenue. For example, we observed a competitive pricing environment, variability in commodity costs, demand softness in Print and demand softness in certain geographic regions in Personal Systems, secular declines in demand for certain products or solutions, including printing products and solutions, inflationary pressures, the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, and foreign currency fluctuations. We have also observed significant inflationary trends in memory and storage costs. In addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses, as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Our gross margins are also subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that we may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; our ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of our products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components; our ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. Moreover, newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period. These factors could also make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to suppliers and manufacturers, manage our relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments.\n\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.\n\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing our global, multi-tier distribution network including the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, we may fail to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services.\n\nConflicts might arise between our various distribution channels, we may experience the loss or deterioration of an alliance or distribution arrangement or a reduced assortment of our products, we may not be able to limit the potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners and we may fail to optimize the use of our pricing programs. Moreover, some of our channel partners and distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. They may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business and trade pressures in the past. Additionally, in certain regions, we rely on a limited number of distributors, which could exacerbate these risks. Trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Net revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’ financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace. \n\n16\n\n\nOur inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing (and factoring in supply chain challenges and order cancellations). Our forecasts do not always accurately predict demand, and distributors have and may continue to increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods, including a multi-tiered channel, may reduce our visibility into inventories, demand and pricing trends. Elevated channel inventory can result in adverse impacts to demand and pricing for our products, the extent and timing of which are difficult to predict with precision or sometimes at all. Accordingly, our distribution model makes forecasting and managing multi-tiered channel inventory more difficult. \n\nIf we were to expand direct distribution initiatives, channel and indirect distributors could consider such initiatives in conflict with their business interests and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products, or cease all sales of our products. Sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products has and could continue to make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and impact pricing in the market. For example, in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory, and misrepresent sales to unauthorized resellers as sales to end-users, frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory or maintain consistent pricing, and negatively impacting gross margins. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. In addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting among the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing. In addition, our global channel partners may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. \n\nOur uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\n\nOur quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If orders fall short of predicted demand, this results in excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, supply disruptions, logistics challenges or declines in demand could adversely impact our inventory levels, our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.    \n\nWe experience seasonal trends in the sale of our products that may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments (particularly, sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter. Consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal holiday demand, and our fourth fiscal quarter ending October 31 has typically been our strongest quarter by revenues. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer may also be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. However, historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and such patterns have been and may be impacted by supply constraints, macroeconomic conditions, such as an economic slowdown or inflationary pressures, shifts in customer behavior and the impacts of pandemics or other public health crises. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margins. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\n\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\n\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, hire, retain, train, motivate, develop, and deploy qualified executives, engineers, technical staff and other key employees. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the technology industry can be intense. Equity-based compensation is essential for attracting and retaining qualified employees and lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. In addition, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and we may not be able to manage changing workforce dynamics successfully. Moreover, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent globally. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and we may be unable to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees or successfully execute succession plans.\n\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop, obtain, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\n\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other IP laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain IP rights in the products and \n\n17\n\n\nservices we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. However, our IP rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such IP rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. In addition, we may choose to not apply for patent protection or may fail to apply for patent protection in a timely fashion. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position. \n\nIn addition, certain of our businesses and products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our IP. Third-party components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our IP without compensation or on undesirable terms. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our IP rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these IP rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights. Finally, we may rely on third parties to enforce certain IP rights.\n\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price.\n\nWe are exposed to cyberattacks seeking to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Such attacks may involve the deployment of ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, or others to disclose passwords, other sensitive information or provide access to our systems or data. Such risks extend not only to our own products, services, systems and networks, but also to those of customers, suppliers, contractors, business partners, vendors, and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. We engage a significant number of these third parties to assist us with various business functions that require the use, storage, processing and deletion of data. While we make efforts to assess and validate the implementation of cybersecurity requirements and controls by these third parties with respect to the services provided and the data handled on our behalf, there remains a risk of misappropriation, compromise or breach of data outside of our direct control. In addition, hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities in design or manufacture, including “bugs” that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the product. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, harm our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our IP or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. \n\nAdditionally, the costs to combat cyber or other security threats can be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security, regardless of their immediacy or accuracy, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business and financial results. \n\nWhile we have implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security threats, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches. Moreover, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby making it more difficult to successfully defend against them or to implement adequate preventative measures. Certain vulnerabilities are difficult to detect even using our best efforts, which may allow those vulnerabilities to persist in our systems over long periods of time. In the past, we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to or use of our systems or those of third parties, which to date, have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there remains the possibility of a future data security incident that results in a material impact to the Company. Additionally, it may be difficult to determine the best way to investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a data security incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our \n\n18\n\n\nability to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that relies upon “deep fake” impersonation technology or other forms of generative automation that may scale up the efficiency or effectiveness of cybersecurity attacks. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\nBecause we process proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business (including data relating to employees, independent contractors and other personnel), our customers and third parties, breaches of our security measures or accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of such data can expose us, our customers, third parties and the individuals affected to a risk of loss, alteration or misuse of such information. A breach could also damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business, and could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, civil monetary penalties or fines and other potential liability for us. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to privacy and data protection, particularly in the U.S., European Union (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)) and China, and other countries’ legislative and regulatory bodies are increasingly proposing new or more stringent requirements relating to privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations continue to evolve, are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing new privacy and data protection measures could be significant.  \n\nPortions of our IT infrastructure, including those provided by third parties, have experienced, and may experience in the future, interruptions, outages, delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations, migration work or other causes, which could result in business disruptions. The process of remediating these issues could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. Further, such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes, resulting in delayed sales, lower margins, lost customers or reputational damage.\n\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and other plans and such plans may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring and other plans in order to realign our cost structure, drive customer satisfaction, product innovation and productivity through artificial intelligence, and achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, including the Fiscal 2023 Plan and our Fiscal 2026 Plan. Implementation of any such plans may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated cost savings, operational improvements and estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all. Additionally, as a result of these plans, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Restructuring and other plans can require a significant amount of time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Moreover, projections of any cost savings or other benefits associated with our restructuring plans are based on current business operations and market dynamics, and could be significantly impacted by various factors, including but not limited to our evolving business models, future investment decisions, market environment and technology landscape. For more information about our restructuring and other plans, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Other Charges” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n\nWe may not be able to execute acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully and we may have difficulty or fail to successfully integrate acquired companies.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business. Risks associated with these transactions include the following:\n\n•In certain instances we have not, and we may not in the future, fully realize the anticipated benefits of particular transactions in the timeframe we expected or at all, such transactions may be less profitable than anticipated or unprofitable, we may not identify all factors to estimate accurately our costs, timing or other matters, and realizing the benefits of a particular transaction may depend upon competition, market trends, additional costs or investments and the actions of advisors, suppliers or other third parties.\n\n•Certain transactions have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to compensation and benefit costs, goodwill and impairment charges, charges from elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, advisory fees, and payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\n\n•Our due diligence may fail to identify significant issues with the target’s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting \n\n19\n\n\npractices or internal controls, including as a result of being dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties, or the assumptions or judgments we make with respect to our due diligence may be incorrect.\n\n•In order to finance a transaction, we may issue common stock (potentially creating dilution) or take on additional debt, which may adversely impact our credit rating.\n\n•These transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\n\n•An acquisition target may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls.\n\n•These transactions may lead to litigation.\n\nIn addition, if we fail to identify, successfully complete and integrate transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. \n\nIn the case of a divestiture, we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience fewer benefits than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our financial performance may be larger than projected. \n\nThe business combination and investment transactions in which we engage may be large or complex, and we must manage post-closing issues such as the integration of the acquired business. Integrations involve significant challenges and are often time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. These challenges include successfully combining product and service offerings; entering or expanding into markets; retaining key employees; integrating employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; and retaining customers and distributors.\n\nOur aspirations and disclosures related to environmental and societal matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance. \n\nWe face increasing attention from the investment community, special interest groups, customers, enforcement authorities and other stakeholders, who may have conflicting views, related to our positions, performance, and disclosures relating to environmental and societal related matters and we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to such positions, performance, and disclosures, which continue to broaden and may be conflicting, both in terms of scope and geography. We have  environmental and societal goals, which  reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our failure to adequately update, accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, or a decision to amend, retire, or stop reporting on certain goals, or positions we take or do not take on social issues could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, special interest groups, customers and enforcement authorities. Additionally, a failure to adequately meet regulatory expectations may result in  the loss of business and reputational impacts, and we periodically are, and in the future could become the target of litigation, investigations or other proceedings initiated by government authorities or private actors alleging that our activities related to environmental and societal matters are anti-competitive, discriminatory or otherwise unlawful. Moreover, efforts to meet evolving and increasingly divergent stakeholder expectations on environmental and societal and related matters may place a strain on our employees and systems.\n\nOur ability to achieve any environmental and societal objectives is subject to numerous risks, some of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources,  evolving regulatory requirements affecting product circularity, environmental or societal standards or disclosures, evolving consumer protection laws, the availability of materials and suppliers that can meet our environmental, societal and other related goals and the availability of funds to invest in environmental and societal initiatives in times where we are seeking to reduce costs.\n\nStandards for tracking and reporting environmental and societal matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting environmental and societal data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting environmental and societal matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting environmental and societal metrics, including sustainability-related disclosures that are or may become required by the SEC, European and other regulators (including, but not limited to, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the state of California’s climate change disclosure requirements), and such standards may change over time, which could result in revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.\n\nSome anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\n\n20\n\n\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent changes of control of HP judged as undesirable by our Board of Directors. These provisions include: authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and controlling the procedures for our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings, and election, appointment and removal of our directors. These provisions could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management or limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock.\n\nMACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nDue to the international nature of our business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.\n\nApproximately 65% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2025 came from outside the United States. In addition, we operate in emerging markets, which can be more volatile. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\n\n•instability in a country’s or region’s economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, health emergencies or pandemics;\n\n•the imposition by governments of additional taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the United States and other countries where HP products are manufactured or sold, including China;\n\n•trade sanctions, embargoes, country localization requirements and import restrictions and other policies and regulations affecting production, shipping, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by any country that may favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;\n\n•political sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-U.S. consumers to purchase from U.S. corporations;\n\n•local labor conditions and regulations, including labor issues faced by suppliers and OEMs, or immigration and labor laws which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent; \n\n•changes or uncertainty in international, national or local legal environments, including tax, data handling, privacy, artificial intelligence, intellectual property, consumer protection, environmental and antitrust laws;\n\n•import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business, prevent us from shipping products, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;\n\n•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws, and adverse consequences for any failure to comply, including compliance by recently acquired companies, which may have less robust internal compliance procedures; and\n\n•fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points for our products and shipments.\n\nThe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States and our supply chain. For example, we rely on manufacturers in Taiwan to produce notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture and have manufacturing operations in Israel which support our Industrial Graphics business. The impact of certain geopolitical conflicts (including any escalation or expansion thereof), such as the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East or tensions in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, and any broadening of ancillary geopolitical, economic, and other effects could adversely impact these operations and could heighten the other risks identified in this report.\n\nSince April 2025, new, substantial tariffs have been imposed on imports to the United States. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the United States and other retaliatory measures. As a result, during fiscal 2025, we experienced higher commodity and tariff costs, which were not fully mitigated by pricing and other actions enacted during the period. Should these or other proposed tariffs, including potential retaliatory actions imposed by other countries, be implemented and sustained for an extended period of time, as proposed, enacted or otherwise, they may have a significant adverse impact to our results of operations and cash flows to the extent our efforts do not fully mitigate the effects of such tariffs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset or mitigate these impacts. Additionally, changing our business model and \n\n21\n\n\nsupply chain to comply with and offset the impact of new or revised trade restrictions has in the past and could in the future be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our business.\n\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty is expected to continue to adversely affect demand for our products and services and, as a result, our business and financial performance.\n\nOur business and financial performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for our products and services. Ongoing economic weakness, including an economic slowdown or recession, uncertainty in markets throughout the world and other adverse economic conditions, including inflation, changes in monetary policy, changes in levels of government spending, increased interest rates, tariffs and other trade restrictions, exchange rates and an evolving global trade environment, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, decreased demand for our products and services and challenges in managing inventory levels and accurately forecasting revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses. For example, during fiscal year 2025 we observed continued market uncertainty, cautious commercial spending on information technology hardware, including in China, lower discretionary consumer spending, increasing commodity costs, inflationary pressures, the implementation of tariffs and other trade restrictions, and foreign currency fluctuations. Changes in government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from governments or organizations that receive government funding. Moreover, U.S. government contracts are subject to congressional funding, which at times has been and may in the future be unavailable or delayed, which could impact our business.\n\nProlonged or more severe economic weakness and uncertainty could also cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations or those of our suppliers, vendors or customers, rapidly and without notice. Poor financial performance of asset markets and the adverse effects of fluctuating exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on interest rates, borrowing costs, exchange rates, costs of hedging and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results.\n\nCurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Indian rupee, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Global events, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainty, may cause currencies to fluctuate, which may contribute to variations in our sales in impacted jurisdictions. Because most of our revenues are generated outside the United States, fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our net revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States, as well as our ability to increase prices. In addition, currency fluctuations, particularly weakness in the Japanese Yen, has and may continue to exacerbate pricing competition for our print products and services. From time to time, we may use derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. However, our hedging strategies may be ineffective, may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations, or may result in losses.\n\nBusiness disruption events could seriously harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\n\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions impacting information technology systems, manufacturing equipment failures, power or water shortages, fires, extreme weather conditions, and other disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. Terrorist acts or armed conflicts, for which we are predominantly uninsured, may also disrupt our operations. Global pandemics or other public health crises may adversely affect, among other things, our supply chain and associated costs; demand for our products and services; our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; our research and development capabilities; our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes; and other important business activities. These events could result in significant losses, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs, require substantial expenditures and recovery time, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. Our operations and those of our suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations in key locations, are disrupted for any reason, such as those described above or other economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political reasons. In addition, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations, they may reduce or cancel their orders, or these events could otherwise result in a decrease in demand for our products.\n\nClimate change and associated regulatory and market impacts may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nThere are climate-related risks wherever our business is conducted. Global climate change is resulting, and is projected to continue to result, in natural disasters and adverse weather, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, flooding, heat waves, and cold waves, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity. Such extreme climate related events are driving changes in market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, and local, national and international climate change policies and regulations, which could result in \n\n22\n\n\ndisruptions to us, our suppliers, vendors, customers and logistics hubs and impact employees’ abilities to live in certain areas, commute or to work from home effectively. These disruptions could make it more difficult and costly for us to deliver our products and services, obtain components or other supplies through our supply chain, maintain or resume operations or perform other critical corporate functions, and could reduce customer demand for our products and services. Furthermore, climate change has reduced the availability and increased the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters.\n\nThe increasing concern over climate change has resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in transition risks such as shifting customer preferences and regulations, including with regard to our products and their environmental impact. These demands have, and we expect will continue to, cause us to incur additional costs and make other changes to our operations. If we fail to manage transition risks effectively, customer demand for our products and services could diminish, and our profitability and cash flow could suffer. Additionally, concerns over climate change have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, the adoption of regulatory requirements designed to address climate change, such as imposing a price on carbon emissions, requirements of increased circularity in products, product efficiency and environmental certification requirements and climate-related disclosures. As a result, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience, increased compliance burdens and costs, increased indirect costs resulting from our suppliers passing on compliance costs to us, and certain of our products may be rendered obsolete, financially unviable or face market access issues. Further, conflicting regulations and a lack of harmonization of legal and regulatory environments across the jurisdictions in which we operate may create enhanced compliance risks and costs. The impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks or transition risks, are expected to be widespread and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.  \n\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets, as well as our subscription based and other offerings.\n\nOur credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. A downgrade of our current credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, reduce access to capital markets and/or market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. In addition, a downgrade of our credit rating could have an adverse impact on our subscription, other recurring revenue business and other offerings and our strategy related to such businesses due to higher borrowing costs and customer preferences when deciding to purchase our subscription based and other offerings. We have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, take actions to manage our capital structure, including reducing our outstanding debt, in order to maintain our credit rating. Such actions may reduce the funds we would otherwise have available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may impact us in a similar manner and have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, access to capital markets and our subscription based and other offerings.\n\nOur debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\nIn addition to our current debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have the effect, among others, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Additionally, further indebtedness may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs, limit the future availability of debt financing and adversely affect our subscription based business.\n\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividends are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate.\n\nAlthough historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to pay cash dividends or to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all. The declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The level of dividends and amount, timing, and purchases under our share repurchase program, if any, are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash, the market price of our common stock, and, with respect to share repurchases, our possession of potentially material nonpublic information. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.\n\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n23\n\n\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. For example, we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition, taxes on earnings and goodwill, and when making decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. We also estimate sales and marketing program incentives based on a number of factors including historical experience, expected customer behavior and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\n\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to various, and sometimes conflicting, federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted and changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or increased restrictions or prohibiting them outright. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product repairability, reuse, recyclability and take-back legislation. In addition, there is existing and proposed legislation related to human rights, environmental and social responsibility (including tracing requirements related to forced labor prohibitions) for our operations, supply chain partners, and our products and services. Moreover, we are becoming increasingly subject to laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements or more prescriptive reporting requirements. Additionally, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies and our obligations to comply with emerging laws and regulations may require us to develop additional AI-specific governance programs, which could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our products and solutions.\n\nAs new laws, regulations, treaties, executive orders, directives, enforcement priorities and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented, we are required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions or our ability to provide services within certain jurisdictions, sanctions or other penalties, including fines. Such burdens or costs have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also face significant compliance and operational burdens and incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with or rectify non-compliance with these laws or regulations. Our potential exposure also includes third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault.   \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, employment, and other issues on a global basis. There is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment, including but not limited to employment and patent-monetization claims in the United States, Germany and Brazil, and litigation and regulatory matters focused on consumer protection, privacy, and competition regulation globally. Patent monetization campaigns have become increasingly aggressive, including those by patent holders for standardized technology, such as Wi-Fi and video and other standardized technology in PCs, who have sued in venues that allow injunctions despite commitments to license patents on fair and reasonable terms. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we may be exposed to exorbitant licensing demands in order to avoid potential disruptions to our business. As described in Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, if decided adversely to or settled by us. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings and settlements have occurred and may occur, including awards of monetary damages, imposition of fines, issuance of injunctions or cease-and-desist orders directing us to cease engaging in certain business practices, cease manufacturing or selling certain products, requiring the compulsory licensing of patents, or requiring other remedies. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, distracting to management, and adversely impact our reputation.\n\n24\n\n\nWe and Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements in connection with the separation of the two businesses. The separation and distribution agreement provides for cross-indemnities between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement. If Hewlett Packard Enterprise or its successor entities (including spun off businesses to which obligations have been transferred) are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\n\nFailure to comply with our customer and partner contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n\nOur contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to procurement regulations, contract provisions, executive orders and other specific requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. In addition, contracts with customers may also include a requirement to comply with customer codes of conduct, which may have terms that conflict with our code of conduct, business policies and strategic objectives. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations or applicable law could result in loss of business or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer. Our partner contracts also contain terms relating to new partner business models and tools creation that could raise issues for which laws or regulations are currently changing or emerging. This could affect us in ways that are not currently fully known or measurable.    \n\nChanges in our tax provisions, adverse tax audits, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial performance.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and approximately 60 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that the positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and, we believe we have provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions, pension and related interest. We adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. Determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates, and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable. We may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows.\n\nOur effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement. In addition, changes in tax law and regulation in the U.S. or elsewhere could significantly impact our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. In addition, our effective tax rate could also be materially affected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (the “OECD”), the European Commission’s and other certain major jurisdictions’ heightened interest in and taxation of large multi-national companies. For instance, the OECD has enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework (“BEPS Pillar Two”), and various governments around the world have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation on these rules.",
