We utilize a blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing processes and capabilities to fulfill a variety of customer needs. Our investment in our production facilities is focused primarily on improving capabilities, product quality, and manufacturing efficiency as well as environmental, health, and safety compliance. We also utilize contract manufacturing from U.S., Asian, and European sources for certain products. The following table shows the percentage of finished goods manufactured and purchased in fiscal 2025 by significant geographic region.\n\nManufacturedPurchasedTotal\n\nUnited States16 %7 %23 %\n\nMexico55 %2 %57 %\n\nAsia— %15 %15 %\n\nOthers5 %— %5 %\n\nTotal76 %24 %100 %\n\nWe operate seven manufacturing facilities in Mexico, some of which are authorized to operate as Maquiladoras under the IMMEX Program, by the Ministry of Economy of Mexico. Maquiladora status allows us to import raw materials into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the Maquiladora program and other local regulations, which have become stricter in recent years.\n\nWe operate nine distribution facilities, including six facilities in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, net sales initiated outside of the U.S. represented approximately 14% of total net sales. See the Supplemental Disaggregated Information footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the geographic distribution of net sales and long-lived assets.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development (“R&D”) is defined as the critical investigation aimed at discovery of new knowledge and the conversion of that knowledge into the design of a new product or service or significant improvement to an existing product or service. We invest in product vitality, including enhancement of existing offerings, with a focus on improving the performance-to-cost ratio and energy efficiency. We also develop software applications that enhance building performance, enterprise operations, and personal experiences. R&D expenses consist of compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, and other administrative costs, but the amounts do not include all new product development costs. For fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, R&D expenses totaled $140.2 million, $102.3 million, and $97.1 million, respectively.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nOur addressable market includes non-portable luminaires as defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; poles for outdoor lighting; emergency lighting fixtures and lighting equipment; lighting controls; HVAC controls; refrigeration controls; audio-video hardware, software, and systems; and building technology controls, software, and systems. \n\nWe operate in highly competitive industries that are affected by a number of general business and economic factors, such as, but not limited to, gross domestic product growth, population growth, government stimulus, employment levels, credit availability, interest rates and inflation, building costs, non-residential fixed investment, freight, construction-related labor availability and costs, building occupancy rates, imports and trade, energy costs, freight costs, tariffs, commodity costs, and commodity availability. Our market is based on non-residential and residential construction, both new as well as renovation and retrofit activity, which may be impacted by these general economic factors. Precise segmentation of the market by new construction and renovation activity is not available, though internal estimates based on third-party data estimate the size of the markets to be about the same. The volume of non-residential construction activity in commercial, institutional, industrial, and infrastructure projects has a material impact on the demand for our lighting, audio-video, and building management solutions. Demand for our products is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending and discretionary income, along with housing construction and home improvement spending. \n\nOur market is influenced by evolving technologies. This evolution includes: the development of new or improved lighting technologies, including solid-state lighting, electronic drivers, embedded lighting controls, and more effective optical designs and lamps; federal, state, and local requirements for updated energy codes; design strategies and technologies addressing intelligent buildings, occupancy experience, and sustainability; and incentives by federal, state, and local municipal authorities, as well as utility companies, for using more energy-efficient lighting and building technology solutions. We are a leading provider of integrated lighting, audio-video, and building technology solutions that utilize internally developed, licensed, or acquired intellectual property. \n\nCompetition\n\nWe experience competition based on numerous factors, including product vitality, service capabilities, price, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, and customer relationships. Our markets are competitive and continue to evolve through acquisition and consolidation activities. Existing and new entrants continue to develop capabilities and solutions that are both complementary as well as competitive to those of traditional industry participants. Additionally, the market for artificial intelligence and software solutions is active with a wide range of competitors, from existing large companies to startup organizations. Certain global and more diversified manufacturers may provide broader offerings utilizing a combination of products and services as well as pricing benefits from the bundling of various offerings. In addition, there are competitors, including importers outside of North America, small startup companies, and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies.\n\nRegulations\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose increasingly complex, stringent, and costly compliance activities. These laws and regulations include but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Harbor data privacy program between the U.S. and the European Union; the United States-Mexico-Canada-Free Trade Agreement (“USMCA”); regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration agency; the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation; California’s Consumer Privacy Act and Connected Device Privacy Act; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal and state labor and employment laws and regulations; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”); and the U.K. Bribery Act.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we allocate resources, including investments in capital and operating costs, to comply with laws and regulations. We do not currently believe that the costs of complying with government regulations have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we may be affected by current or future standards, laws, or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, material content, climate change, product functionality, geopolitics, corporate social responsibility, employee health and safety, privacy, or similar concerns. These standards, laws, and regulations may impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and services. They may also place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or may impact the willingness of certain investors to own our shares. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n\nRaw Materials\n\nOur production requires raw materials, including certain grades of steel and aluminum, electrical and electronic components, plastics, and other petroleum-based materials and components. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of materials, freight, tariffs, and duties on certain materials, particularly imports from outside North America, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components, and sourced finished goods.\n\nWe do not currently engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials, though we have and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials generally for a period of up to 12 months. We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including, but not limited to, quality, service, and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness, quality, and availability of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.\n\n3\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe own various domestic and foreign patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property, which are important factors for our businesses. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws as well as agreements, restrictive covenants, and internal processes and controls to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these protections, unauthorized parties may take actions that infringe on our intellectual property. Further, we conduct business in countries where our intellectual property coverage may be more limited and/or our ability to enforce intellectual property rights may be difficult or impracticable. We also have licenses to certain patents and trademarks, which, if not renewed, could adversely impact our business. As of August 31, 2025, we had approximately 1,700 total patent assets including issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. While patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is individually material to us.\n\nSeasonality\n\nBoth ABL and AIS exhibit some seasonality, with net sales being affected by business days, weather and seasonal demand on construction and installation programs, particularly during the winter months, and the annual budget cycles of major customers. Historically, with certain exceptions, we have experienced our highest sales in the last two quarters of each fiscal year due to these factors.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nWe employed approximately 13,800 employees at August 31, 2025, of which approximately 4,300 were employed in the United States and approximately 8,200 were employed in Mexico. Our remaining employees were employed in other international locations including Europe, Canada, and the Asia/Pacific region. Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements in place or in process cover approximately 1,300 and 6,700 employees in the United States and Mexico, respectively. Arrangements related to fewer than 100 employees in the United States will expire within the next fiscal year. Arrangements for approximately 6,600 employees in Mexico will expire within the next fiscal year, primarily due to statutory requirements of annual negotiations of union contracts. We believe that we have strong relationships with both our unionized and non-unionized employees. \n\nA key pillar to attract, develop, and retain top talent is our focus on the growth and development of our employees. In fiscal 2025, we remained focused on development through development plans for employees, special projects, training opportunities, and other activities. Our performance management and other processes are intended to align employee aspirations, interests, performance, and experiences with the talent needs that enable the business. Managers and employees conduct periodic check-in discussions to encourage continuous performance feedback and improvement. These discussions also act to hold leaders accountable for creating an employee development culture. \n\nInvesting in the development of our employees is part of our operating system and correlates to our preparedness to meet current and future strategic priorities of the business. In fiscal 2025, we continued a management effectiveness series focused on coaching to performance, which we offered through in-person events and ongoing sustainment activities. We provide on-demand, virtual, and in-person instructor led classes to help employees and customers expand their technical knowledge.\n\nWe review our compensation and benefit plans annually to ensure that we are providing competitive, contemporary, and inclusive programs so we can attract and retain the best people and support the health and well-being of our employees and their families. Based on this review, we offer a competitive total rewards package to our employees that includes base compensation, annual cash incentive programs, stock grants with service and/or performance requirements, health benefits, and/or retirement benefits commensurate with an employee's position, skill set, and experience.\n\nWe strive to ensure our employees have a safe and collaborative work environment through the inclusion of world class health and safety management practices in our business. Our management practices promote Environmental, Health & Safety (“EHS”) excellence. To achieve this standard, we have instituted an EHS Management System based on the goals and guidelines of the International Standards of Operation for Environmental Management, International Standards for Occupational Health & Safety Management, and our own guiding principles. These guidelines include identifying and controlling hazardous exposures for the prevention of injuries, preventing pollution, and complying with all relevant legal and other requirements. We review each facility’s qualitative and quantitative results, with an emphasis on leading indicators that help avoid violations, accidents, and injuries. A variety of different metrics is averaged to determine a facility’s performance, which is used to find continuous improvement opportunities.\n\n4\n\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nWe contribute to energy savings and carbon emissions reduction primarily through replacing legacy technologies with more efficient products. Our energy data management software enables users to track and report their carbon footprint. We also aim to improve raw material efficiency and operate our facilities in a more productive and environmentally responsible manner. Progress on these initiatives is communicated through our EarthLIGHT program.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nAcuity Inc. was incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors.\n\nThis filing contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A variety of risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These risks could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and financial expectations and could cause the market price of our securities to decrease. Such risks include the following, without limitation.\n\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\n\nOur results may be adversely affected by market and competitive pricing.\n\nAggressive pricing actions by competitors may affect our ability to manage the price/cost relationship to achieve desired revenue growth and profitability levels. Potential decreased demand for our products resulting from factors including uncertainty in the global economy, an inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and a potential global recession may influence competitor pricing. Additionally, dynamic pricing models may not cover our rising costs. Even if we were able to increase prices to cover our costs, competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to pass on any more than the cost increases. Alternatively, if costs were to decline, the marketplace may not allow us to hold prices at their current levels.\n\nInnovations of new products and services may not yield desired returns, which may also expose our assets, particularly inventory, to potential write-downs.\n\nContinual introductions of new products and solutions, services, and technologies, enhancement of existing products and services, and effective servicing of customers are key to our competitive strategy. The success of new product and solution introductions depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, product quality, market acceptance, including entrance into new verticals, and our ability to manage the risks associated with product life cycles, such as additional inventory obsolescence risk as product life cycles begin to shorten, new products and production capabilities, effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels to support anticipated product manufacturing and demand, availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Additionally, new products and solutions may not achieve the same profit margins as expected or as compared to our historic products and solutions. Market adoption of new products may impact the sales of other products and may expose on-hand inventories to future write-downs. Accordingly, we cannot fully predict the ultimate effect of new product introductions on our business. Furthermore, other market participants, such as well-established competitors, could develop alternative platforms for monetizing products, solutions, and services that result in a paradigm shift in our industry, particularly with respect to new and developing technologies.\n\nWe may not be able to identify, finance, and complete suitable acquisitions, alliances, or investments, and acquisitions, alliances, or investments that we pursue may not yield anticipated benefits.\n\nWe have allocated capital within our business to fund acquisitions, alliances, and investments and may continue to do so as opportunities arise in the future. We will benefit from such activity only to the extent that we can effectively identify suitable acquisition and alliance candidates, close those identified acquisitions and alliances, and leverage and integrate the assets or capabilities of the acquired businesses and alliances, including, but not limited to, personnel, technology, and operating processes. It may be difficult for us to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our business operations. Any acquisitions, alliances, or investments may not be successful or realize the intended benefits. Moreover, unanticipated events, negative revisions to valuation assumptions and estimates, diversion of resources and management's attention from other business concerns, and difficulties in attaining synergies, among other factors, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our ability to recover initial and subsequent investments, resulting in non-cash impairment charges, particularly those related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets or non-controlling interests. In addition, such investment transactions may limit our ability to invest in other activities that could be more profitable or advantageous. \n\nWe may experience difficulties in streamlining activities, which could impact shipments to customers, product quality, and the realization of expected savings from streamlining actions.\n\nWe expect to benefit from potential programs to streamline operations, including the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of overhead costs. Such benefits will only be realized to the extent that we can effectively leverage assets, personnel, and operating processes in the transition of production between manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty is inherent within the facility consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality.\n\nGeneral business, political, and economic conditions, including the strength of the construction and renovation market, political events, or other factors may affect demand for our products and services.\n\nWe compete based on numerous factors, including product vitality and service levels, as well as features and benefits, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, service capabilities, and price. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive environment that is influenced by a number of general business and economic factors, such as economic vitality, employment levels, credit availability, interest rates, trends in vacancy rates and rent values, energy costs, and commodity costs. Sales of our products and services depend significantly on the level of activity in new construction and renovation/retrofits. Declines in general economic activity, appropriations, and regulations, including tax and trade policy and other political uncertainties, may negatively impact new construction and renovation projects, or our ability to expand into new geographies, which in turn may impact demand for our product and service offerings.\n\nDecreased construction and renovation spending and consumer demand for our products and services, along with rising commodity costs may materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments. Additionally, potential economic slowdowns, supply chain disruptions, or a global recession could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets. This may require us to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of our customers and other counter-parties to make payments to us, on a timely basis or at all.\n\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\nOur business and results have been and may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost or availability of raw materials, components, purchased finished goods, or services.\n\nWe utilize a variety of raw materials and components in our production process including steel, aluminum, lamps, certain rare earth materials, microchips, light emitting diodes (“LED”), LED drivers, ballasts, wire, electronic components, power supplies, petroleum-based byproducts, natural gas, and copper. We also source certain finished goods externally. Supply chain disruptions for certain components, including microchips and electronics, have resulted in higher prices for significant commodities and materials, as well as increased warehousing, freight, and container costs, which have negatively impacted our business. Future disruptions in the supply chain and shortages could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis, or at all, or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components by entering into longer term guaranteed supply agreements. Alternatively, supply chain disruptions and shortages could require us to rely on relatively high-cost spot market purchases for certain materials or products.\n\nFuture increases in our costs could negatively impact our profitability as there can be no assurance that future price increases will be successfully passed through to customers. We generally source our goods from a number of suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers for certain components and certain purchased finished goods, which on a limited basis, results in sole-source supplier situations.\n\nOur competitors supply certain items, and those competitors and other suppliers may, for various strategic reasons, choose to cease selling to us. In addition, our ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of our supply chain could result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers, and in turn, increased risk associated with reliance on a single or a limited number of suppliers. Furthermore, volatility in certain commodities, such as oil, impacts all suppliers and, therefore, may result in additional price increases from time to time regardless of the number and availability of suppliers. Profitability and volume could be negatively impacted by limitations inherent within the supply chain of certain of these component parts, including competitive, governmental, and legal limitations, natural disasters, and other events that could impact both supply and price. Additionally, we are dependent on certain service providers for key operational functions. While there are a number of suppliers of these services, the cost to change service providers and set up new processes could be significant.\n\n7\n\n\nTechnological developments and increased competition could affect our operating profit margins and sales volume.\n\nWe compete in an industry and markets where technology and innovation play major roles in the competitive landscape. We are highly engaged in the investigation, development, and implementation of new technologies and services. Securing employee talent, key partnerships, and alliances, including having access to technologies, services, and solutions developed by others, as well as obtaining appropriate patents and the right to utilize patents of other parties all play a significant role in protecting our freedom to operate. Additionally, the continual development of new technologies by existing and new source suppliers — including non-traditional competitors with significant resources — looking for either direct market access or partnerships with competing large manufacturers, coupled with significant associated exclusivity and/or patent activity, could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating profit margins and desirable levels of sales volume. \n\nIn addition, there are new competitors, including small startup companies and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies. These competitors may vertically integrate and begin offering total solution packages that directly compete with our offerings. Certain global and more diversified electrical manufacturers as well as certain global technology and building solution providers may be able to obtain a competitive advantage, either through internal development or acquisitions, over us by providing broader offerings that utilize a combination of products and/or services, and small startup companies may offer more localized product sales and support services within individual regions.\n\nWe may be unable to sustain significant customer and/or channel partner relationships.\n\nRelationships with customers are directly impacted by our ability to deliver quality products and services. Although no individual customer exceeded 10% of net sales during fiscal 2025, 2024, or 2023, the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by certain larger customers could harm our business in a meaningful manner. We have relationships with channel partners such as electrical distributors, home improvement retailers, independent sales agencies, system integrators, and value-added resellers. While we maintain positive, and in many cases long-term, relationships with these channel partners, the sudden or unplanned loss of a number of these channel partners or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases from a major channel partner or a group of channel partners could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by external disruptions, including geopolitical and/or other conditions, to our operations.\n\nDisruptions to our operations including, but not limited to, labor disputes, strikes, workplace violence, public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, climate change, brown outs and other power outages, earthquakes, fires, floods, extreme precipitation, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, water scarcity, cyber-attacks, civil or political disruptions, or other catastrophic events such as war, insurrection, or natural disasters, leading to production interruptions in our or one or more of our suppliers’ facilities could adversely affect us. Approximately 55% of our finished products are manufactured in Mexico, a country that periodically experiences heightened civil unrest or may experience trade disputes with the U.S., both of which could cause a disruption of the supply of products to or from these facilities. Further, because many of our customers are to varying degrees dependent on planned deliveries from our facilities, those customers that have to reschedule their own production, delay opening a facility, or incur other disruptions due to our missed deliveries as a result of these disruptions could pursue financial claims against us. We may incur costs to correct any of these problems in addition to facing claims from customers. Further, our reputation among actual and potential customers may be harmed and result in a loss of business. These types of events may negatively impact residential, commercial, and industrial spending, including construction and renovation spending as well as consumer spending on our products, in impacted regions or, depending on the severity, globally. As a result, any of such events could adversely impact us. While we have developed business continuity plans, including alternative capacity, to support responses to such events or disruptions and maintain insurance policies covering, among other things, physical damage and business interruptions, these policies may not cover all losses. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, and substantial losses in operational capacity.\n\nCurrent global conflicts, such as those between Russia and Ukraine as well as within the Middle East, have created substantial uncertainty in the global economy, including sanctions and penalties imposed on certain countries and persons by several governments. While we do not have operations in these locations and do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, we are unable to predict the impact that these actions will have on the global economy or on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n8\n\n\nCompany operating systems, information systems, or devices have experienced, and may experience in the future, a failure or a compromise of security, which could adversely impact our operations as well as the effectiveness of internal controls over operations and financial reporting.\n\nWe are highly dependent on various software and automated systems to record and process operational and financial transactions. We have experienced, and could experience in the future, a failure of one or more of these software and automated systems or we could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing a new software system. \n\nWe have also experienced compromises of our security, and could experience in the future, a compromise of our security for reasons including technical system flaws, the improper installation of an upgrade or update, the proper installation of an upgrade or update that has consequences unforeseen by us or the software provider, data input or record-keeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties, such as through viruses, malware, or phishing. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. We may also be subject to disruptions of systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, including but not limited to hacking, malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, exploitation of internet-connected devises, and other attacks, epidemics, computer viruses, and electrical/telecommunications outages). \n\nWhile prior compromises of our security have not had, in the aggregate, a material impact on the Company’s operations and financial condition, the Company expects events of this nature to continue as cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. As artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies advance, new and increasingly sophisticated attack methods are emerging, including fraud involving impersonation technologies or other forms of generative automation that enhance the scale and effectiveness of cyber threats. The techniques used in such attacks change rapidly, and certain vulnerabilities or attack methods may go undetected until after they\n\nare already deployed, potentially allowing them to persist within our systems for extended periods. The Company monitors its data, information technology, and personnel usage of Company systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. Refer to Part I, Item 1C. Cybersecurity for further details.\n\nIf any of our hardware, software, or automated systems are compromised, fail, or have other significant shortcomings, it could disrupt our business, require us to incur substantial additional expenses, or result in potential liability or reputational damage. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology will prevent such compromises of security.\n\nWe also provide and maintain technology to enable lighting controls, building technology systems, and audio-video platforms. In addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with these customer offerings. For example, a customer may depend on integral information from, or functionality of, our technology to support that customer’s other systems, such that a failure of our technology could impact those systems, including by loss or destruction of data. Likewise, a customer’s failure to properly configure, update, segregate, or upgrade its own network and integrations with our technology is outside of our control and could result in a failure in functionality or security of our technology.\n\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors may receive and store personal information in connection with human resources operations, customer offerings, and other aspects of the business. A material network breach in the security of these systems could include the theft of intellectual property, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, change, or destruction of our or our customers', suppliers', or other third-party's confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, other disruptions of our customers' or other third parties' business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect relationships with our customers, employees, and others, or lead to claims against us. Such claims may result in the payment of fines, penalties, and costs and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may incur significant costs, regulatory fines, or penalties, or be required to take actions, to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\n\nChanges in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could adversely impact our operations\n\nWe are subject to an increasing number of evolving and uncertain data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on us and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, processing, disclosure, and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and other costs. New privacy and security laws are \n\n9\n\n\nfrequently enacted. Inconsistencies between the interpretation and the practical application of both existing and new laws are common across jurisdictions. Additionally, we routinely undertake contractual obligations to comply with all applicable laws, so a violation of a data privacy or security law could result in additional contractual liability.\n\nSystem failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage our systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations, and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nChanges in our relationships with employees, changes in U.S. or international employment regulations, an inability to attract and retain talented employees, or a loss of key employees could adversely impact the effectiveness of our operations. \n\nWe employed approximately 13,800 people as of August 31, 2025, approximately 9,300 of whom are employed in international locations. We have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing relationships with employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Union recognition and collective bargaining agreements are in place or in process covering approximately 58% of our workforce. Collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 48% of our workforce will expire within one year, primarily due to annual negotiations with unions in Mexico. While we believe that we have good relationships with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action by these employees.\n\nOur success is also dependent upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a qualified and diverse workforce, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, particularly during times of increased labor costs or labor shortages. We rely upon the knowledge and experience of employees involved in functions throughout the organization that require technical expertise and knowledge of the industry. We have experienced intense competition for qualified and capable personnel in key markets and with key skills, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, assimilating, and retaining personnel in the future. In addition, our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for skilled workers is currently high. We face an increasingly competitive labor market due in part to sustained labor shortages and are subject to inflationary pressures on employee wages, salaries, and benefits, which have and may continue to increase labor costs and impact labor availability. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can offer. An inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of employees could adversely impact our ability to execute key operational functions.\n\nThere are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.\n\nRisks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including: defining and controlling contract scope and timing, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of subcontractors and suppliers and our own systems. As we expand our service and solutions offerings, reliance on the technical infrastructure to provide services to customers will increase. If we fail to appropriately manage and secure the technical infrastructure required, customers could experience service outages or delays in the implementation of services. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur liabilities and other losses. \n\nWe may be subject to risk in connection with third-party relationships necessary to operate our business.\n\nWe utilize strategic partners and third-party relationships in order to operate and grow our business. For instance, we utilize third parties for contract manufacturing of certain products, subcontract installation, and commissioning, as well as for performing certain selling, distribution, and administrative functions. We cannot control the actions or performance, including product quality, of these third parties and therefore, cannot be certain that we or our end-users will be satisfied. Any future actions of or any failure to act by any third party on which our business relies could cause us to incur losses or interruptions to our operations. In addition, we act as a general contractor in certain relationships with third parties, and as such are subject to risks applicable to general contractors.\n\n10\n\n\nWe are subject to risks related to operations and suppliers outside the United States.\n\nWe have substantial activities outside of the United States, including sourcing of products, materials, components, and contract manufactured finished goods, as well as manufacturing and distribution activities. Our operations, as well as those of key vendors, are therefore subject to regulatory, economic, political, military, and other events in countries where these operations are located. In addition to the risks that are common to both our domestic and international operations, we face risks specifically related to our foreign operations and sourcing activities, including but not limited to: exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; increased inflation; unstable political, social, regulatory, economic, financial, and market conditions; laws that prohibit shipments to certain countries or restricted parties and that prohibit improper payments to government officials such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; potential for privatization and other confiscatory actions; trade restrictions and disruption; shipping delays or disruptions, criminal activities, increases in tariffs and taxes, corruption, terrorist action, nationalization and expropriation, limitations on repatriation of earnings or other capital requirements, and other changes in regulation in international jurisdictions that could result in substantial additional legal or compliance obligations for us. Additionally, if we expand our global footprint into new geographies or territories, our exposure to these risks may increase.\n\nWe source certain components and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, some of which are subject to import tariffs. These tariffs could increase in future periods resulting in higher costs and/or lower demand. We could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to mitigate the impacts of the tariffs. \n\nWe operate seven manufacturing facilities in Mexico, some of which are authorized to operate as Maquiladoras by the Ministry of Economy of Mexico. Maquiladora status allows us to import raw materials into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the Maquiladora program and other local regulations, which have become stricter in recent years. In addition, if our Mexican facilities cease to qualify for Maquiladora status or if the Mexican government adopts additional adverse changes to the program, including nationalization, our manufacturing costs in Mexico could increase.\n\nWe are also subject to certain other laws and regulations affecting our international operations, including laws and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which, among other things, provide certain beneficial duties and preferential tariff treatment for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. A large portion of our sales are impacted by the USMCA. In addition, the U.S. government has initiated or is considering imposing tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel, copper, and aluminum. Increased and/or proposed tariffs by the United States have led, and may continue to lead, to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA, or other international trade agreements and policies. Trade wars or other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, costs, customers, suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors therein, and, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe evolution of our products, the complexity of our supply chain, and our reliance on third-party vendors such as customs brokers and freight vendors, which may not have effective processes and controls to enable us to fully and accurately comply with such requirements, could subject us to liabilities for past, present, or future periods. Such liabilities could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe continue to monitor conditions affecting our international locations, including potential changes in income from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Some of these risks, including but not limited to foreign exchange rates, violations of laws, and higher costs associated with changes in regulation, could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely impact our business. \n\nWe are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We engage in cross-border transactions through operations in multiple countries, which increases our exposure to exchange rate volatility. Significant changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our pricing competitiveness, cost structure and overall financial performance. In particular, a stronger U.S. dollar could reduce the competitiveness of our products in international markets. Conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar could raise the cost of imported inventory, materially increasing the cost of goods sold, which could adversely impact our business.\n\n11\n\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters.\n\nThere has been, and may continue to be, an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. Some investors may use ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibilities do not align with their ESG criteria. In addition, different stakeholder groups have divergent views on ESG matters, which increases the risk that any action or lack thereof with respect to ESG matters will be perceived negatively by at least some stakeholders and could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\n\nWe may, from time to time, communicate certain initiatives, targets, and goals regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other ESG matters. These initiatives, targets, and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure thereof. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives, targets, and goals, and progress against those targets and goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions, estimates, and climate scenarios that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized or subject to litigation for the scope or nature of such initiatives, targets, or goals, or for any revisions to such targets or goals. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail, or are perceived to fail, to achieve progress with respect to our ESG targets or goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected. \n\nWe have begun to incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities in our product offerings and operations, and challenges with properly managing the use of AI and machine learning could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\n\nWe have begun incorporating AI capabilities into certain product offerings as well as utilizing AI as part of our operational processes. These features may become more important over time. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Many known and unknown risks related to AI exist. Currently recognized risks include issues related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity, and data provenance. If the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, or biased, we could be subject to competitive risks, potential legal liability, and reputational harm, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI capabilities may also result in cybersecurity incidents. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI capabilities could adversely affect our business. Finally, multiple jurisdictions have either already put in place laws and regulations governing the use of AI, or are considering such laws and regulations, and additional constraints may result from industry efforts. Compliance with these laws, regulations, and industry frameworks may limit our ability to leverage AI or require us to substantially revise our approach to its use.\n\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\nFailure to comply with the broad range of standards, laws, and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in exposure to substantial disruptions, costs, and liabilities.\n\nWe are subject to various foreign and domestic federal, state, and local laws and regulations that include but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Harbor data privacy program between the U.S. and the European Union; the USMCA; regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration agency; the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation; California’s Consumer Privacy Act and Connected Device Privacy Act; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal and state labor and employment laws and regulations; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”); and the U.K. Bribery Act. The laws and regulations impacting us impose increasingly complex, stringent, and costly compliance activities.\n\nConcerns regarding climate change may also lead to significant legislative and regulatory responses, including efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has implemented regulations that require reporting of GHG emissions or that limit emissions of GHGs from certain mobile or stationary sources. In addition, the U.S. Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states and other jurisdictions have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of \n\n12\n\n\nGHG inventories, GHG permitting, and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. It is uncertain whether, when, and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program, or other state programs, may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol and joined the Paris Agreement. \n\nIn addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. Some environmental laws, such as Superfund, the Clean Water Act, and comparable laws in U.S. states and other jurisdictions worldwide, impose joint and several liability for the cost of environmental remediation, natural resource damages, third-party claims, and other expenses, without regard to the fault or the legality of the original conduct, on those persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years, and certain federal, state, and local governments domestically and internationally, have enacted, or are considering enacting, new laws and regulations, including those governing raw material composition, carbon dioxide and other air emissions, end-of-life product dispositions, energy efficiency, and certain additional disclosure obligations related to the above. \n\nWe may be affected by those or other future standards, laws, or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, climate change, our carbon footprint, product functionality, geopolitical, corporate social responsibility, or similar concerns. As customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases, if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate or operate in ways that minimize the energy use of or other impacts of our products or operations, customers may choose more energy efficient or sustainable alternatives. These standards, laws, or regulations may also impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and may place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or on the willingness of certain investors to own our shares. In addition, we may be subject to consumer lawsuits or enforcement actions by governmental authorities if our ESG claims relating to product marketing are inaccurate. At the same time, certain actions that we may take in our efforts to address ESG concerns may be challenged as being inconsistent or prohibited by various federal, state, or local laws and regulations. It is uncertain what laws, rules, or regulations may be enacted, or how courts may interpret them in the future, and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact such laws or regulations may have on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The laws and regulations regarding ESG disclosures and requirements are also rapidly evolving and could have an adverse effect on our operations, and the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs.\n\nIt is uncertain what laws will be enacted, and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The laws and regulations regarding ESG disclosures and requirements are also evolving and could have an adverse effect on our operations and the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs.\n\nWe may develop unexpected legal contingencies or matters that exceed insurance coverage.\n\nWe are subject to and in the future may be subject to various claims, including legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Such claims may include without limitation employment claims, product recall, personal injury, network security, data privacy, or property damage claims resulting from the use of our products, services, or solutions, as well as exposure to hazardous materials, contract disputes, or intellectual property disputes. We are insured up to specified limits for certain types of losses with a self-insurance retention per occurrence, including product or professional liability, and cyber liability, including network security and data privacy claims, and are fully self-insured for certain other types of losses, including environmental, product recall, warranty, commercial dispute, and patent infringement losses. We establish accruals for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the level of insurance coverage we hold and/or the amounts accrued for such claims. In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolutions of such matters could be unfavorable. Our insurance coverage is negotiated on an annual basis, and insurance policies in the future may have coverage exclusions that could cause claim-related costs to rise.\n\nIf our products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, or are otherwise alleged to cause harm or injury, we may need to recall those items, may have increased warranty costs, and could be the target of product liability claims.\n\nWe may need to recall products if they are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, and we do not maintain insurance for such recall events. Many of our products and solutions have become more complex in recent years and include more sophisticated and sensitive electronic components. A problem or issue relating to any \n\n13\n\n\nindividual component could have the effect of creating a compounded problem for an integrated solution, which could result in significant costs and losses. We have increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in our own facilities. We have previously initiated product recalls or formal campaigns soliciting repair or return of a product as a result of potentially faulty components, assembly, installation, design, and packaging of our products. Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. In addition, products we developed that incorporate technologies, such as LED, generally provide for more extensive warranty protection, which may result in higher costs if warranty claims on these products are higher than historical amounts. We may also be liable if the use or failure of any of our products cause harm, whether from fire, shock, harmful materials or components, alleged adverse health impacts from exposure to light emitted by our products, or any other personal injury or property damage, and we could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us in excess of our insurance limits. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our products, even if such costs or liabilities are covered under supplier warranty obligations. We have incurred and may incur in the future charges and loss of reimbursed cash flows from such suppliers. A significant product recall, warranty claim, product liability case, and/or challenges around seeking indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.\n\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and could be the target of intellectual property claims.\n\nWe own certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. Where appropriate, these assets are the subject of registrations or other filings with governmental entities. In addition, we have internal policies and processes that establish a strategy for protecting newly developed key company technologies. We make decisions about what intellectual property to register based on these policies and processes. Formal protection for all company intellectual property is not appropriate, but even if it were, it could not be obtained without incurring significant legal expenses and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to intellectual property rights that we have obtained, we cannot be certain that others have not infringed and will not infringe on these rights. Enforcement actions against these third parties could result in significant legal expenses, which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLike others in the industry, from time to time we receive allegations of patent infringement from competitors and from non-practicing entity patent holders. Those allegations may be coupled with offers to license their patents for use in our products. We typically address those allegations by developing invalidity or non-infringement positions or obtaining access to such patents through licensing, cross-licensing, or other mutually beneficial arrangements. To the extent we cannot develop such positions and are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable economic terms, it could adversely impact us.\n\nWe are exposed to certain regulatory, financial, and other risks related to climate change and other sustainability matters.\n\nThe scientific consensus indicates that emissions of GHGs continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities, and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. \n\nConcerns regarding climate change may lead to significant legislative and regulatory responses, including efforts to limit GHG emissions. The EPA has implemented regulations that require reporting of GHG emissions or that limit emissions of GHGs from certain mobile or stationary sources. In addition, the U.S. Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting, and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. It is uncertain whether, when, and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program, or other state programs, may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol and joined the Paris Accord. These and other existing or potential international initiatives and regulations could affect our international operations. As customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases, if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate or operate in ways that minimize the energy use of our products or operations, customers may choose more energy efficient or sustainable alternatives. These actions could also increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. We may also be subject to consumer lawsuits or enforcement actions by governmental authorities if our ESG claims relating to product \n\n14\n\n\nmarketing are inaccurate. It is uncertain what laws will be enacted, and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nIn addition, certain investors and stakeholders are increasingly interested in ESG matters, and as stakeholder ESG expectations and standards evolve, our failure to sufficiently respond to these evolving standards and expectations may cause us to suffer from reputational damage, and our business or financial condition could be adversely affected. The laws and regulations regarding ESG disclosures and requirements are also evolving and could have an adverse effect on our operations and the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs.\n\nTax liabilities due in the jurisdictions in which we operate may exceed anticipated amounts.\n\nOur operations are subject to income tax, sales tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), excise tax, property tax, and other taxes and assessments at federal, state, local, and international levels. Our consolidated tax obligation is driven largely by our corporate structure as well as domestic and international intercompany arrangements. We operate in several jurisdictions, including but not limited to, the United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws, regulations, and policies in an effort to raise additional tax revenue, and international tax authorities may seek to assert extraterritorial taxing rights on our transactions or operations. \n\nWe have previously been subject to domestic and international tax audits by taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may be subject to additional such audits in the future. While our previous audits resulted in no significant findings, and we believe we continue to be in compliance with relevant tax laws, tax authorities may challenge or disagree with certain positions or methodologies in calculating our tax positions. An unfavorable interpretation or outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, result in additional tax obligations owed, impact the amount of recoverable VAT, and/or increase excise taxes owed, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. \n\nFurther, tax laws and regulations in domestic and international jurisdictions are often extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations and may require us to make judgments and estimates about our provisions, including with respect to certain transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded, which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\n\nAdditionally, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws, regulations, policies, or decisions in the United States or in the other jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\n\nThe market price and trading volume of our shares may be volatile.\n\nThe market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by customers, competitors, or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as general global economic, industry, and political conditions, or due to our ability to accurately forecast our performance. Our performance could be different than analyst expectations or issued guidance, causing a decline in our stock price. To the extent that other large companies within our industry experience declines in share price, our share price may decline as well. In addition, we may discontinue or reduce dividend payments and may discontinue or suspend our share repurchase program based on several factors, including our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Any modification or suspension of dividends and any suspension or termination of our share repurchase program could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nWhen the market price of our shares drops significantly, shareholders could institute securities class action lawsuits against us or otherwise engage in activism, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\n\nRisks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\n\nSignificant changes in actual investment returns on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our comprehensive income and the amount of contributions we are required to make to the defined benefit plans in future periods. As our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities are marked-to-market on an \n\n15\n\n\nannual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, the income or expense for the plans is calculated using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for the defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations. Unfavorable changes in these factors could adversely affect our results. Additionally, planned or actioned termination or settlement activities of any of our defined retirement benefit plans may not be approved timely, or at all, by the appropriate regulatory authorities; may result in additional non-cash charges within our results of operations as well as additional administrative costs; and/or may not yield the desired benefits.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to interest rate risks, and changes in interest rates can reduce demand for our products and increase borrowing costs.\n\nRising interest rates could have a negative effect on overall economic activity, and could impair the ability of real estate developers, property owners, contractors, and system integrators to obtain reasonable costs of capital on borrowed funds, resulting in depressed levels of construction and renovation projects and a resulting decrease in demand for our products and services. Rising interest rates could also impair our customers’ ability to repay obligations to us. Additionally, rising interest rates may increase our cost of capital, which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and cash flows.",
