      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\n  Overview \n\n  We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing novel products to patients for the treatment of serious rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. We have built a diverse portfolio of approved therapies and product candidates aimed at addressing diseases with high unmet medical need and clear biology for treatment, for which there are typically no approved therapies treating the underlying disease. \n\n  We were founded in April 2010 by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., and are led by a management team experienced in the development and commercialization of rare disease therapeutics. Our strategy is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency. \n\n  Our Strategy \n\n  The critical components of our business strategy include the following: \n\n  •Focus on rare and ultrarare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical need and clear biology. There are numerous rare and ultrarare genetic diseases that currently have no drug therapy approved that treat the underlying disease. Patients suffering from these diseases often have a significant morbidity and/or mortality. We focus on developing and commercializing therapies for multiple such indications with the utmost urgency. We also focus on diseases that have biology that is well understood. We believe that developing drugs that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs. Our modalities of biologics, small molecules, adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy, and nucleic acids provide us with what we believe is an optimal set of options to treat genetic diseases by selecting the best treatment strategy available for each disease.\n\n  •In-license promising product candidates; retain global commercialization rights to product candidates. Our current product candidates are generally in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. We believe parties agree to license product candidates to us because they are confident in our team’s expertise in rare disease drug development and commercialization. We generally intend to retain global commercialization rights to our products and product candidates whenever possible to maximize the potential value of our product portfolio. \n\n  •Focus on excellent, rapid, and efficient clinical and regulatory execution on multiple programs in parallel. We believe that building a successful and sustainable rare disease-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of patient identification, clinical study design and conduct, and regulatory strategy. Because rare disease programs involve fewer patients and may have accelerated paths to market, we are able to feasibly develop multiple clinical-stage product candidates in parallel, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value, with some economies of scale.\n\n  •Commercialize through patient-focused global organization. We seek to commercialize our products throughout the developed world, in North America, the European Union, or the EU, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., Latin America, Turkey, Asia, and select international markets. We have established our own commercial organization in these markets and a network of third-party distributors in smaller markets. We believe our commercial organization is highly specialized and focused, due to the nature of rare disease treatment.\n\n  4\n\n  Approved Products and Clinical Product Candidates\n\n  Our current approved therapies and clinical-stage pipeline consist of four product categories: biologics, small molecules, AAV gene therapy, and nucleic acid product candidates.\n\n  We have four commercially approved products, Crysvita® (burosumab) for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH, and tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO, Mepsevii® (vestronidase alfa) for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis VII, or MPSVII or Sly Syndrome, Dojolvi® (triheptanoin) for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD, and Evkeeza® (evinacumab) for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. The following table summarizes our approved products and pipeline of clinical product candidates:\n\n  5\n\n  Approved Products\n\n  Crysvita for the treatment of X-Linked Hypophosphatemia, or XLH, and Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia, or TIO\n\n  Crysvita is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered via subcutaneous injection, that targets fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, developed for the treatment of XLH. XLH is a rare, hereditary, progressive, and lifelong musculoskeletal disorder characterized by renal phosphate wasting caused by excess FGF23 production. There are approximately 48,000 patients with XLH in the developed world, including approximately 36,000 adults and 12,000 children. Crysvita is the only approved treatment that addresses the underlying cause of XLH. Crysvita is approved in the U.S., the EU and certain other regions for the treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older.\n\n  Crysvita is also approved in the U.S. and certain other regions for the treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphatemia in TIO, associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that cannot be curatively resected or localized in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. There are approximately 2,000 to 4,000 patients with TIO in the developed world. TIO can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness.\n\n  We are collaborating with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or KKC, and Kyowa Kirin, a wholly owned subsidiary of KKC, on the development and commercialization of Crysvita globally.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Products— Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.” for a description of our collaboration and license agreement with KKC.\n\n  Mepsevii for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII, or MPS VII\n\n  Mepsevii is an enzyme replacement therapy administered intravenously, or IV, that replaces the missing enzyme (beta-glucuronidase), developed for the treatment of MPS VII or Sly syndrome. MPS VII is a rare lysosomal storage disease that often leads to multi-organ dysfunction, pervasive skeletal disease, and death. MPS VII is one of the rarest MPS disorders, affecting an estimated 200 patients in the developed world. Mepsevii is approved in the U.S., the EU and certain other regions for the treatment of children and adults with MPS VII.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Products—Saint Louis University” for a description of our license agreement with Saint Louis University.\n\n  Dojolvi for the treatment of Long-chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders, or LC-FAOD \n\n  Dojolvi is a highly purified, synthetic, 7-carbon fatty acid triglyceride administered orally, designed to provide medium-chain, odd-carbon fatty acids as an energy source and metabolite replacement, developed for people with LC-FAOD. LC-FAOD represents a set of rare metabolic diseases that prevents the conversion of fat into energy and can cause low blood sugar, muscle rupture, and heart and liver disease. Dojolvi is approved in the U.S. and certain other regions as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed LC-FAOD. There are approximately 8,000 to 14,000 patients in the developed world with LC-FAOD.\n\n  In November 2024, we announced that we had received a positive finalized assessment report with agreement to file for Conditional Early Approval, or CEA, from Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, based on the currently available global clinical data for the product. With this feedback, we expect to file a Japan-New Drug Application for CEA in mid-2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Products—Baylor Research Institute” for a description of our license agreement with Baylor Research Institute.\n\n  Evkeeza for the treatment of Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH \n\n  Evkeeza is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered by IV, that binds to and blocks the function of angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, a protein that plays a key role in lipid metabolism, developed for the treatment of HoFH, a rare inherited condition. HoFH occurs when two copies of the genes causing familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited, one from each parent, resulting in dangerously high levels (>400 mg/dL) of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, or LDL-C, which is bad cholesterol. Patients with HoFH are at risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events as early as their teenage years. Evkeeza is approved in the U.S., where it is marketed by our partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, or Regeneron. It is also approved in the European Economic Area, or EEA, Brazil and Japan as a first-in-class therapy for use together with diet and other LDL-C lowering therapies. In these regions, Evkeeza is generally approved to treat adults and adolescents aged five years and older with clinical HoFH. There are approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients with HoFH in the developed world outside of the U.S.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Products—Regeneron” for a description of our license agreement with Regeneron.\n\n  6\n\n  Clinical Product Candidates\n\n  UX143 (setrusumab) for the treatment of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or OI\n\n  UX143 (setrusumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered by IV that inhibits sclerostin, a protein that acts on a key bone-signaling pathway by inhibiting the activity of bone-forming cells and promoting bone resorption. Setrusumab is being developed for the treatment of OI, or brittle bone disease, which is caused by variants in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, leading to either reduced or abnormal collagen and changes in bone metabolism. There are an estimated 60,000 patients in the developed world affected by OI. UX143 has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Breakthrough Designation from the FDA, and was accepted into the EMA’s Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program. Setrusumab is subject to our collaboration agreement with Mereo and is the lead clinical asset in our bone endocrinology franchise. \n\n  In April 2024, we announced all patients in the Phase 3 Orbit and Cosmic studies had been enrolled. The Phase 3 portion of Orbit enrolled 159 patients and is a randomized placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of setrusumab compared to placebo on the rate of annualized clinical fractures in patients aged five to less than 25 years. Cosmic enrolled 69 patients and is an active-controlled study evaluating the effect of setrusumab compared to intravenous bisphosphonate, or IV-BP, therapy on annualized total fracture rate in patients aged two to less than seven years.\n\n  In June 2024, we announced positive 14-month results from the Phase 2 portion of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Orbit study demonstrating that, as of a May 24, 2024 data cut-off date, treatment with setrusumab continued to show statistically significant reductions in the incidence of fractures in patients with OI compared to the pre-treatment period. Treatment with setrusumab also resulted in ongoing and meaningful improvements in lumbar spine bone mineral density, or BMD, at month 12 without evidence of plateau.\n\n  As we announced in June 2024, the median annualized rate of radiologically confirmed fractures across all 24 patients in the two years prior to treatment was 0.72. Following a mean treatment duration period of 16 months, the median annualized fracture rate was reduced 67% to 0.00 (p=0.0014; n=24). The reduction in annualized fracture rates was associated with continued, clinically meaningful increases in BMD. Tests conducted at the 12-month timepoint demonstrated that treatment with setrusumab resulted in a mean increase in lumbar spine BMD from baseline of 22% (p<0.0001, n=19) across all age groups (five to less than 26 years old), a further improvement from 14% observed at six months of treatment. This increase in BMD is reflected in the change from the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of -1.73 to -0.49 at 12 months across all age groups, a substantial normalization in Z-score of +1.25 (p<0.0001, n=18). This is further improved from the mean six-month Z-score change of +0.85. The improvements in BMD and Z-scores were statistically significant and consistent across all OI sub-types studied.\n\n  As of the May 24, 2024 data cut-off, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed in the study. Reported adverse events were generally consistent with those observed in the Asteroid study with infusion-related events and headache determined to be the most common adverse events related to the study drug. As of the data cut-off, there were no reported hypersensitivity reactions related to setrusumab.\n\n  In January 2025, we announced that the Phase 3 Orbit study is progressing to the second interim analysis expected in mid-2025. Patients in the Cosmic study also continue to be treated with either setrusumab or IV-BP therapy and will be evaluated in parallel with the second Orbit interim analysis in mid-2025 and final analyses, if needed, in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates—Mereo” for a description of our license and collaboration agreement with Mereo.\n\n  GTX-102 for the treatment of Angelman Syndrome\n\n  GTX-102 is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, administered by intrathecal injection that inhibits expression of the paternal UBE3A antisense. GTX-102 is being developed for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a debilitating and rare neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function of the maternally inherited allele of the UBE3A gene. There are an estimated 60,000 patients in the developed world affected by Angelman syndrome. GTX-102 has received Fast Track Designation, Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA and has been accepted into the EMA’s PRIME program.\n\n  In January 2024, we announced that enrollment in the Expansion Cohorts had been completed in the Phase 1/2 study of GTX-102 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. Across the Phase 1/2, including the Dose Escalation and Expansion Cohorts, there are a total of 74 patients enrolled in the Phase 1/2 study. \n\n  In April 2024, we presented interim data from the Phase 1/2 study at the 76th Annual American Academy of Neurology Meeting. Patients in Expansion Cohorts A & B treated with GTX-102 showed rapid and clinically meaningful improvement across multiple domains consistent with or exceeding Dose Escalation Cohorts 4-7 data at Day 170. Treatment of the Dose Escalation Cohorts 4-7 showed long-term increasing and sustained clinical benefit far exceeding Natural History data at Day 758.\n\n  7\n\n  In December 2024, we announced that enrollment began in the global Phase 3 Aspire study, which is expected to enroll approximately 120 children ages four to 17 with Angelman syndrome with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of full maternal UBE3A gene deletion. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive GTX-102 by intrathecal injection via lumbar puncture or to the sham comparator group during the 48-week primary efficacy analysis period. The primary endpoint will be improvement in cognition assessed by Bayley-4 cognitive raw score, and the key secondary endpoint (with a 10% allocation of alpha) will be the Multi-domain Responder Index across the five domains of cognition, receptive communication, behavior, gross motor function, and sleep. Enrollment in the Phase 3 Aspire study is expected to complete in the second half of 2025. \n\n  The Phase 2/3 Aurora study, which will evaluate GTX-102 in other Angelman syndrome genotypes and ages, is expected to initiate in 2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates—GeneTx” for a description of our license agreement with GeneTx Biotherapeutics LLC, or GeneTx. \n\n  UX111 (rebisufligene etisparvovec) for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome type A or MPS IIIA\n\n  UX111 (formerly ABO-102) is an adeno-associated virus 9, or AAV9, gene therapy product candidate, administered by a one-time IV infusion that provides the cross-correcting enzyme that enables the breakdown of Heparan sulfate, or HS. UX111 is being developed for the treatment of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, or MPS IIIA, a rare lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatment, which primarily affects the central nervous system. There are an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 patients in the developed world affected by Sanfilippo syndrome type A. The program was acquired through an exclusive license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics, or Abeona, that was announced in May 2022. The UX111 program has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease, and Orphan Drug Designations in the U.S., and PRIME and Orphan Medicinal Product designations in the EU.\n\n  In December 2024, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for UX111 supported by the available data, including from the ongoing pivotal Transpher A study. New clinical data were presented at WORLDSymposium™ 2025 in February 2025, that demonstrated treatment with UX111 led to a statistically significant improvement in the Bayley-III raw scores for the subdomains of cognition, receptive communication and expressive communication in patients with MPS IIIA compared to Natural History Data from untreated patients. These clinical endpoints were correlated with substantial and sustained reduction in levels of heparan sulfate in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n  The FDA granted the BLA Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date of August 18, 2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates—Abeona” for a description of our license agreement with Abeona.\n\n  DTX401 (pariglasgene brecaparvovec) for the treatment of Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia, or GSDIa\n\n  DTX401 is an adeno-associated virus 8, or AAV8, gene therapy clinical candidate, administered by a one-time IV infusion that is designed to deliver stable expression and activity of G6Pase-α, an essential enzyme in glycogen and glucose metabolism. DTX401 is being developed for the treatment of patients with GSDIa, and is the most common genetically inherited glycogen storage disease, with an estimated 6,000 patients in the developed world. A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, was accepted by the EMA. The DTX401 program has received Rare Pediatric Disease, RMAT, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations in the U.S., and PRIME and Orphan Medicinal Product Designations in the EU.\n\n  In May 2024, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 GlucoGene study for the treatment of patients aged eight years and older. The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with DTX401 resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in daily cornstarch intake compared with placebo at Week 48. \n\n  In November 2024, we provided updated, longer-term Phase 3 data. After the 48-week primary efficacy analysis period, crossover patients (previously treated with placebo) were eligible to receive DTX401. As of the data cut-off, 12 crossover patients had reached Week 30 post-treatment and had a substantial 61.6% mean reduction of daily cornstarch at this early timepoint, double the rate of decrease when compared to patients in the original DTX401 treatment arm (n=20) at week 30 and that showed a mean 41.3% reduction at the end of the 48-weeks. Patients from the original DTX401 treatment arm who had reached 78 weeks are continuing to reduce their daily cornstarch intake, while maintaining glycemic control. DTX401 has demonstrated a consistent and acceptable safety profile with no new safety concerns identified as of the data cut-off. \n\n  These results have been discussed with regulatory authorities in a pre-BLA meeting and will be included as part of a BLA submission in mid-2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates—REGENXBIO Inc.” for a description of our license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc.\n\n  8\n\n  DTX301 (avalotcagene ontaparvovec) for the treatment of Ornithine Transcarbamylase, or OTC, deficiency\t\n\n  DTX301 is an AAV8 gene therapy product candidate, administered by a one-time IV infusion that is designed to deliver stable expression and activity of the OTC, gene. DTX301 is being developed for the treatment of patients with OTC deficiency, which is the most common urea cycle disorder, and there are approximately 10,000 patients in the developed world with OTC deficiency, of which we estimate approximately 80% are classified as late-onset, our target population. DTX301 has received Orphan Drug Designation in both the U.S. and in the EU and Fast Track Designation in the U.S.\n\n  In February 2025, we announced enrollment had been completed in the Phase 3 study of DTX301 for the treatment of OTC deficiency with a total of 37 patients randomized 1:1 to DTX301 or placebo. The co-primary endpoints are the percentage of patients who achieve a response as measured by the change in 24-hour plasma ammonia levels and discontinuation or reduction ammonia-scavenger medications and protein-restricted diet. Based on an amended protocol, the change in 24-hour ammonia levels will be measured through Week 36, after which the study would unblind and patients will be followed for a total of up to 64 weeks to determine the complete responders able to move safely to both ammonia-scavenger medications and protein-restricted diet control. \n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates—REGENXBIO Inc.” for a description of our license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc.\n\n  UX701 (rivunatpagene miziparvovec) for the treatment of Wilson Disease\n\n  UX701 is an AAV type 9 gene therapy, administered by a one-time IV infusion that is designed to deliver a truncated form of the ATP7B gene. UX701 is being developed for the treatment of patients with Wilson disease, which affects more than 50,000 patients in the developed world. UX701 has received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and in the EU. UX701 has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA.\n\n  In February 2024, we announced that we enrolled and dosed 15 patients in the three dose escalating cohorts of the first, dose-finding, stage of the pivotal Cyprus2+ study of UX701 for the treatment of Wilson disease. During Stage 1, the safety and efficacy of UX701 is being evaluated across three, sequential dosing cohorts (Cohort 1: 5.0 x 10^12 GC/kg Cohort 2: 1.0 x 10^13 GC/kg and Cohort 3: 2.0 x 10^13 GC/kg).\n\n  In October 2024, we shared that UX701 demonstrated clinical activity in the pivotal Cyprus2+study as well as improvements in copper metabolism for patients treated in Stage 1. Multiple responders had completely tapered off standard-of-care treatment with responses seen in all three dose cohorts. In Stage 1, 15 patients were enrolled into the three sequential dosing cohorts and followed for at least 24 weeks. Six of the patients completely tapered off of standard-of-care treatment with chelators and/or zinc therapy, and a seventh patient had begun tapering as of the data cut-off date in August 2024. In patients who had tapered off standard-of-care, non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) had stabilized to normal, healthy levels. In some patients, there were increases in ceruloplasmin-copper activity consistent with improved ATP7b function. UX701 has been well tolerated, with no unexpected related treatment-emergent adverse events and no significant immunologic safety events as of the data cut-off.\n\n  We expect to enroll a fourth cohort in Stage 1 at a moderately increased dose and with an optimized immunomodulation regimen to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of the gene therapy, with the objective of having the majority of patients come off standard-of-care treatment before selecting a dose for the randomized placebo-controlled stage of the study. Enrollment in Cohort 4 is expected to begin in the first half of 2025 and expected to complete in the second half of 2025.\n\n  Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Clinical Product Candidates— REGENXBIO Inc.” for a description of our license and collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO Inc.\n\n  Competition\n\n  In the case of indications that we are targeting, it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat these diseases.\n\n  With respect to Crysvita, although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development by a competitor for the treatment of XLH and TIO, it is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches such as gene therapy, to treat XLH and TIO. Most pediatric patients with XLH are managed using oral phosphate replacement and/or vitamin D therapy, which is relatively inexpensive and therefore may adversely affect our ability to commercialize Crysvita, if approved, in some countries. \n\n  9\n\n  With respect to Mepsevii, we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for MPS VII, but it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat this disease. Additionally, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches may emerge for the treatment of lysosomal diseases. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants have also been used in MPS VII and in other lysosomal storage diseases and represent a potential competing therapy. Stem cell transplants have been effective in treating soft tissue storage and in having an impact on brain disease, but have not to date proven effective in treating bone and connective tissue disease. Typically, enzyme replacement therapy has had an impact on bone and connective tissue disease in other disorders when patients were treated early. \n\n  With respect to Dojolvi, LC-FAOD is commonly treated with diet therapy and MCT oil. Dojolvi may compete with this approach. Although we believe that Dojolvi should be considered a drug and will be regulated that way, it is possible that other companies or individuals may attempt to produce triheptanoin for use in LC-FAOD. Investigators are testing triheptanoin in clinical studies across multiple indications, including LC-FAOD. Although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development for the treatment of LC-FAOD, it is also possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize other medium odd-chain fatty acids, or completely different compounds, to treat LC-FAOD. Other companies may also utilize other approaches, such as gene therapy, to treat LC-FAOD. Competitors could also enter the market with generic versions of Dojolvi. As described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” below, in 2024, Navinta LLC (Navinta), Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., or collectively, Aurobindo, Esjay Pharma Private Limited and Esjay Pharma LLC, or collectively, Esjay, filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Dojolvi.\n\n  With respect to Evkeeza, the current treatments for patients with HoFH involve various lipid-lowering agents to reduce serum LDL and total cholesterol levels. Drug therapies include statins (e.g., Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin, etc.), fenofibrate, ezetimibe (Ezetrol), evolocumab (Repatha), and lomitapide (Juxtapid/Lojuxta). Other than lomitapide, these agents rely on an LDL-receptor based mechanism to reduce cholesterol, which may be absent in HoFH patients, particularly those with LDLR-null mutations. In addition, we are aware of other clinical development programs that target ANGPTL 3 across various indications including HoFH, including from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, zodasiran an siRNA, Eli Lilly/Dicerna, solbinsiran an siRNA, Novo Nordisk, NNC0491-6075 an antibody, and CRISPR Therapeutics, CTX-301 a gene editor.\n\n  With respect to UX143, there are currently no approved drugs for OI. Most pediatric patients with OI are managed with off-label use of bisphosphonates to increase bone density and reduce frequency of bone fracture. We are aware of another anti-sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, that is in Phase 3 clinical testing by Amgen.\n\n  With respect to GTX-102, there are currently no approved drugs for Angelman syndrome. Many patients take general treatments to try to manage specific symptoms, such as seizures or sleep disturbances, but there are no treatments available that address the underlying biology of the disease. We are aware of other preclinical and clinical development programs for Angelman syndrome, including Phase 2 programs from Ionis, ION582 an ASO, and Neuren Pharmaceuticals, NNZ-2591 an IGF-1 analog.\n\n  With respect to UX111, there are currently no approved pharmacologic treatments for patients with MPS IIIA. Patients receive supportive or symptomatic treatment, but these approaches generally do not prevent functional decline. We are aware of other gene therapies, including EGT-101, in Phase 1/2 for MPSIIIA by Esteve. In addition, Orchard Therapeutics is developing OTL-201, an ex-vivo gene therapy in Phase 1/2 for MPSIIIA. We are also aware of enzyme replacement therapies, including DNL126, in Phase 1/2 by Denali, and JR-441, in Phase 1/2 by JCR Pharma.\n\n  With respect to DTX401, there are currently no pharmacologic treatments for patients with GSDIa. We are aware of an mRNA therapy, mRNA-3745, in Phase 1 for GSDIa by Moderna.\n\n  With respect to DTX301, the current treatments for patients with OTC deficiency are nitrogen scavenging drugs and severe limitations in dietary protein. Drug therapy includes sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) and glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti), both nitrogen scavengers that help eliminate excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, by facilitating its excretion. A novel formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate, ACER-001 by Acer Therapeutics, was approved in December 2022. During a metabolic crisis, patients routinely receive carbohydrate and lipid rich nutrition, including overnight feeding through a nasogastric tube, to limit bodily protein breakdown and ammonia production. In acute cases, ammonia must be removed by dialysis or hemofiltration. Liver transplant may also be a solution for OTC deficiency. In addition, we are aware of other clinical development programs for OTC deficiency including from Arcturus Therapeutics, ARCT-810 a mRNA, Bloomsbury, BGT-OTCD a gene therapy, and iECURE, ECUR-506 a gene editor.\n\n  With respect to UX701, there are no currently approved treatments that address the underlying cause of Wilson disease. Many patients are on chelator therapies, but these fail to address the mutated ATP7B copper transporter gene. We are aware of a chelator, ALXN-1840, that is in Phase 3 for Wilson disease by Monopar Therapeutics.\n\n  10\n\n  License and Collaboration Agreements \n\n  Our products and some of our current product candidates have been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Following is a description of our significant license and collaboration agreements.\n\n  Approved Products\n\n  Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.\n\n  In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with KKC. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, we and KKC collaborate on the development and commercialization of Crysvita in the field of orphan diseases in the U.S. and Canada, or the Profit-Share Territory, and in the EU, U.K., and Switzerland, or the European Territory, and we have the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America. In the field of orphan diseases, and except for ongoing studies being conducted by KKC, we were the lead party for development activities in the Profit-Share Territory and in the European Territory until the applicable transition date. We shared the costs for development activities in the Profit-Share Territory and the European Territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KKC. In April 2023, which was the transition date for the Profit-Share Territory, KKC became the lead party and became responsible for the costs of the development activities. However, we will continue to share the costs of the studies commenced prior to the applicable transition date equally with KKC. Crysvita was approved in the EU and U.K. in February 2018 and was approved by the FDA in April 2018. As described below, we and KKC shared commercial responsibilities and profits in the Profit-Share Territory until April 2023, KKC has the commercial responsibility in the European Territory, and we are responsible for commercializing Crysvita in Latin America and Turkey. \n\n  In the Profit-Share Territory, KKC booked sales of products and we had the sole right to promote the products, with KKC having the right to increasingly participate in the promotion of the products until the transition date of April 2023, which was five years from commercial launch. The parties subsequently agreed that we would have the right to continue to support KKC in commercial field activities in the U.S. through January 31, 2025, as amended. After January 31, 2025, our rights to promote Crysvita in the U.S. are limited to medical geneticists and we solely bear our expenses for the promotion of Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory. See “Item I.A. Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks related to our dependency on KKC for the commercialization of Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory. In the European Territory, KKC books sales of products and has the sole right to promote and sell the products, with the exception of Turkey. In Turkey, we have rights to commercialize Crysvita and KKC has the option to assume responsibility for such commercialization efforts. In Latin America, we book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products.\n\n  Under the collaboration agreement, KKC manufactures and supplies Crysvita for sales in Latin American territories and we pay KKC a transfer price of 30% of net sales. We also pay KKC a low single-digit royalty on net sales in Latin America. The remaining profit or loss from commercializing products in the Profit-Share Territory was shared between us and KKC on a 50/50 basis until April 2023. In April 2023, commercialization responsibilities for Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory transitioned to KKC and KKC assumed responsibility for the commercialization of Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory at and after April 2023. Thereafter, we are entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share from the mid-20% range up to a maximum rate of 30%, intended to approximate the profit-share. Our and KKC’s obligations to pay royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis for so long as we or KKC, as applicable, are selling products in such country. \n\n  In July 2022, we sold to OCM LS23 Holdings LP, an investment vehicle for the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS, our right to receive 30% of the future royalty payments due to us based on net sales of Crysvita in the U.S. and Canada, subject to a cap, beginning in April 2023. KKC pays us a royalty of up to 10% based on net sales in the European Territory. We sold our interest in the European Territory royalty to RPI Finance Trust, an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, in December 2019.\n\n  The collaboration and license agreement will continue for as long as products in the field of orphan diseases are sold in the Profit-Share Territory, European Territory, Turkey, or Latin America, unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. \n\n  KKC may terminate the agreement in certain countries or territories based upon our failure to meet certain milestones. Furthermore, either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. In any event of termination by KKC, unless such termination is the result of KKC’s termination for certain types of breach of the agreement by us, we may receive low single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net post-termination sales by KKC in one or more countries or territories, the amount of which varies depending on the timing of, and reason for, such termination. In any event of termination, our rights to Crysvita under the agreement and our obligations to share development costs will cease, and the program will revert to KKC, worldwide if the agreement is terminated as a whole or solely in the terminated countries if the agreement is terminated solely with respect to certain countries. \n\n  11\n\n  Saint Louis University \n\n  In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Saint Louis University, or SLU, wherein SLU granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to Mepsevii. Under the terms of the license agreement, SLU granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell therapeutics related to SLU’s beta-glucuronidase product for use in the treatment of human diseases. \n\n  Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay to SLU a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products in Europe and Japan, subject to certain potential deductions. Our obligation to pay royalties to SLU in these territories continues until the expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity.\n\n  Baylor Research Institute \n\n  In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended, with Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, under which we exclusively licensed certain intellectual property related to Dojolvi. The license includes patents, patent applications, know-how, and intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of Dojolvi as well as its use in treating a number of orphan diseases, including LC-FAOD. The license grant includes the sole right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize licensed products for all human and animal uses. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in select orphan indications. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations with respect to a specified orphan indication or set of orphan indications, BRI may convert our license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such orphan indication or set of orphan indications until we receive regulatory approval for licensed products in the applicable orphan indication or set of orphan indications. \n\n  We are also obligated to pay a mid- single-digit royalty on net sales to BRI, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our obligation to pay royalties to BRI continues on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the first regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to such product in such country or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, in each case in connection with approval in such country for LC-FAOD or an orphan disease covered by our license from BRI.\n\n  Regeneron\n\n  In January 2022, we announced a collaboration with Regeneron to commercialize Evkeeza for HoFH outside of the U.S. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we received the rights to develop, commercialize and distribute the product for HoFH in countries outside of the U.S. The Company paid Regeneron a $30.0 million upfront payment. To date, we have recognized an aggregate of $27.5 million for regulatory and sales milestones and have in aggregate up to $35.5 million of future obligations for additional regulatory and sales milestones, if achieved. We may share in certain costs for global trials led by Regeneron and also received the right to opt into other potential indications.\n\n  Under the collaboration agreement, Regeneron supplies the product and charges us a transfer price from the low 20% range up to 40% of net sales.\n\n  Clinical Product Candidates\n\n  REGENXBIO Inc.\n\n  In October 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENX, under which we were granted an option to develop products to treat OTC deficiency and GSDIa. Under the 2013 license agreement, REGENX granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell, and offer for sale licensed products with respect to such disease indications, subject to certain exclusions. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. Under the 2013 license agreement, we pay or will pay REGENX an annual maintenance fee and certain milestone fees per disease indication, low to mid- single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, and milestone and sublicense fees, if any, owed by REGENX to its licensors as a result of our activities under the 2013 license agreement. We are required to develop licensed products in accordance with certain milestones. In the event that we fail to meet a particular milestone within established deadlines, we can extend the relevant deadline by providing a separate payment to REGENX.\n\n  12\n\n  In March 2015, we entered into an option and license agreement with REGENX, which was subsequently amended, pursuant to which we have an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell, and offer for sale licensed products to treat Wilson disease and CDKL5 deficiency. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. Under the 2015 option and license agreement, as amended, we pay or will pay REGENX an annual maintenance fee and certain milestone fees per disease indication, mid- to high single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, and mid- single to low double-digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicenses for the licensed intellectual property rights. We are required to develop licensed products in accordance with certain milestones. In the event that we fail to meet a particular milestone within established deadlines, we can extend the relevant deadline by providing a separate payment to REGENX.\n\n  In March 2020, we entered into a license agreement with REGENX, for an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to REGENX’s NAV AAV8 and AAV9 vectors for the development and commercialization of gene therapy treatments for a rare metabolic disorder. In return for these rights, we made an upfront payment and pay or will pay certain annual fees, milestone payments and royalties on any net sales of products incorporating the licensed intellectual property that range from a high single-digit to low double-digit.\n\n  University of Pennsylvania\n\n  In May 2016, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the University of Pennsylvania, or UPENN, under which we are collaborating on the pre-clinical development of gene therapy products for the treatment of phenylketonuria and Wilson disease, each, a Subfield. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain patent rights arising out of the research program, and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain University of Pennsylvania intellectual property, in each case to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, commercialize and import licensed products in each Subfield for the term of the agreement. We will fund the cost of the research program and will be responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of each Subfield. In addition, we are required to make milestone payments (up to a maximum of $5.0 million per Subfield) if certain development milestones are achieved over time. We will also make milestone payments of up to $25.0 million per approved product, if certain commercial milestones are achieved, and will pay low to mid- single-digit royalties on net sales of each Subfield’s licensed products.\n\n  GeneTx\n\n  In August 2019, we entered into a Program Agreement and a Unitholder Option Agreement with GeneTx to collaborate on the development of GeneTx’s GTX-102, an ASO for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. In July 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Unitholder Option Agreement, as amended, we exercised the Option to acquire GeneTx and entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we purchased all the outstanding units of GeneTx. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we paid the option exercise price of $75.0 million, an additional $15.6 million to acquire the outstanding cash of GeneTx, and adjustments for working capital and transaction expenses of $0.6 million, for a total purchase consideration of $91.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we achieved a $30.0 million regulatory milestone upon the initiation of the Phase 3 Aspire clinical study for GTX-102. In addition, we are obligated to pay up to $85.0 million in additional regulatory approval milestones for the achievement of U.S. and EU product approvals, and up to $75.0 million in commercial milestone payments based on annual worldwide net product sales, contingent upon the achievement of the milestones. We will also pay tiered mid- to high single-digit percentage royalties based on licensed product annual net sales. If we receive and resell an FDA priority review voucher, or PRV, in connection with a new drug application approval, GeneTx unitholders are entitled to receive a portion of proceeds from the sale of the PRV or a cash payment from us, if we choose to retain the PRV. \n\n  As part of our acquisition of GeneTx, we assumed a License Agreement with Texas A&M University, or TAMU. To date, we have recognized an aggregate of $0.5 million for clinical milestones under the TAMU agreement, and have in aggregate up to $23.0 million of future obligations for various future milestones, if achieved, a nominal annual license fee that may increase up to a maximum of $2.0 million, as well as royalties in the mid-single-digits of net sales.\n\n  13\n\n  Mereo\n\n  In December 2020, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Mereo to collaborate on the development of setrusumab. Under the terms of the agreement, we will lead future global development of setrusumab in both pediatric and adult patients with OI and were granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize setrusumab in the U.S., Turkey, and the rest of the world, excluding the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, or the Mereo Territory, where Mereo retains commercial rights. Each party will be responsible for post-marketing commitments and commercial supply in their respective territories.\n\n  Upon the closing of the transactions under the License and Collaboration Agreement with Mereo in January 2021, we made a payment of $50.0 million to Mereo. To date we have recognized an aggregate $9.0 million for regulatory milestones and have in aggregate up to $245.0 million of future obligations for additional regulatory and sales milestones under the agreement, if achieved. We will pay for all global development costs as well as tiered double-digit percentage royalties to Mereo on net sales in the U.S., Turkey, and the rest of the world, and Mereo will pay us a fixed double-digit percentage royalty on net sales in the Mereo Territory. If we receive and resell an FDA PRV in connection with a new drug application approval, Mereo is entitled to receive a portion of proceeds from the sale of the PRV or a cash payment from us, in the event we choose to retain the PRV. \n\n  In December 2024, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Mereo where we are responsible for the supply of setrusumab to Mereo in the Mereo territory. Mereo is responsible to reimburse us for a portion of the manufacturing process development costs as well as future commercial supply costs.\n\n  Abeona \n\n  In May 2022, we announced an exclusive License Agreement with Abeona for an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of MPS IIIA, or UX111. Under the terms of the agreement, we assumed responsibility for the UX111 program and in return, we are obligated to pay Abeona certain UX111-related prior development costs and other transition costs. Abeona is eligible to receive tiered royalties of up to 10% on net sales and commercial milestone payments of up to $30.0 million following regulatory approval of the product. Additionally, we entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Abeona to transfer and assign to us the exclusive license agreement between Nationwide Children’s Hospital, or NCH, and Abeona for certain rights related to UX111. Under this agreement, NCH is eligible to receive from us up to $1.0 million in development and regulatory milestones as well as royalties in the low single-digits of net sales. \n\n  Preclinical Pipeline \n\n  Solid Biosciences Inc.\n\n  In October 2020, we entered into a strategic Collaboration and License Agreement with Solid Biosciences Inc., or Solid, and received an exclusive license for any pharmaceutical product that expresses Solid’s proprietary microdystrophin construct from AAV8 and variants thereof in clade E for use in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other diseases resulting from lack of functional dystrophin, including Becker muscular dystrophy. We are collaborating to develop products that combine Solid’s differentiated microdystrophin construct, our Pinnacle PCLTM producer cell line platform, or Pinnacle PCL Platform, manufacturing platform, and our AAV8 variants. Solid may provide some development support and was granted an exclusive option to co-invest in products we develop for profit-share participation in certain territories. We also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Solid in October 2020 pursuant to which we purchased 521,719 shares (as adjusted for the October 2022 reverse stock split) of Solid’s common stock for an aggregate price of $40.0 million. \n\n  Patents and Proprietary Rights \n\n  The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our products, product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our products, product candidates, processes, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our products, product candidates, and processes. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technologies, inventions, and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.\n\n  14\n\n  We also use other means to protect our products and product candidates, including the pursuit of marketing or data exclusivity periods, orphan drug status, and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries, including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. See “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Biosimilars and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Patent Term Restoration,” “Government Regulation—EU Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” and “Government Regulation—EU Regulation — New Chemical Entity Exclusivity” below for additional information. \n\n  We seek regulatory approval for our products and product candidates in disease areas with high unmet medical need, significant market potential, and where we expect to have a proprietary position through patents covering various aspects of our product candidates, such as composition, dosage, formulation, use, and manufacturing process, among others. Our success depends in part on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio by filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. \n\n  Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to achieve or maintain market exclusivity or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. We also cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, product candidates, or processes. For more information, please see “Item I.A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”\n\n  As of December 31, 2024, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to more than 275 issued and in-force patents (not including individually validated national patents in European Patent Convention member countries) that cover one or more of our products or product candidates, methods of their use, or methods of their manufacture, including more than 50 in-force patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, we own, jointly own, or have exclusive rights to more than 325 pending patent applications, including more than 50 pending U.S. applications. \n\n  With respect to our owned or in-licensed issued patents in the U.S. and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain an extension of patent term to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the U.S., this extended coverage period is known as patent term extension, or PTE, and can only be obtained provided we apply for and receive a marketing authorization for a product. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. In Europe, a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, may be available to extend the term of certain European patents covering our products; this requires application for an SPC in individual European Patent Convention, or EPC, member countries following product approval. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. In the U.S., the exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA. \n\n  The exclusivity positions for our commercial products and our clinical-stage product candidates as of December 31, 2024, are summarized below.\n\n  Crysvita Exclusivity\n\n  We have in-licensed rights from KKC to patents and patent applications relating to Crysvita and its use for the treatment of XLH, TIO, and various other hypophosphatemic conditions. Pursuant to this license, we have rights to six issued U.S. patents, as well as issued patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions. The U.S. patents expire between 2028 and 2035. In addition to the foregoing patent protections, Crysvita is protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2030 and by orphan drug exclusivity for treating XLH and TIO until 2025 and 2027, respectively. \n\n  Mepsevii Exclusivity\n\n  We own four issued U.S. patents and corresponding issued foreign patents covering Mepsevii and its use in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as MPS VII. These patents expire in 2035. Mepsevii is also protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2029. \n\n  15\n\n  Dojolvi Exclusivity\n\n  We have an exclusive license from BRI to patents and patent applications relating to Dojolvi and its use for the treatment of FAOD. Pursuant to this license, we have rights to two issued U.S. patents covering Dojolvi which expire in 2025 and 2029.

Dojolvi is also protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2025 and orphan drug exclusivity for treating FAOD until 2027. \n\n  Evkeeza Exclusivity\n\n  We have an exclusive license from Regeneron to certain Regeneron patents for the development and commercialization of Evkeeza outside of the U.S. for the treatment of HoFH and other hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia indications. The in-licensed Regeneron patent portfolio includes a patent family containing several issued foreign patents that expire in 2032 and cover the Evkeeza antibody; Regeneron has filed supplementary protection certificates to extend the rights associated with the European patent within this family until 2036 in certain countries. The in-licensed Regeneron patent portfolio contains five other patent families, one of which includes several pending patent applications directed to a stabilized pharmaceutical formulation comprising Evkeeza; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2040. In addition to the foregoing patent protections, Evkeeza is protected in Europe by data exclusivity until 2029 and marketing exclusivity until 2031. \n\n  DTX401 (Pariglasgene Brecaparvovec) Exclusivity\n\n  We have a non-exclusive license from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to an issued U.S. patent expiring in 2034 (not accounting for any available PTE) and corresponding foreign patents covering a recombinant nucleic acid construct used in DTX401 that includes a codon-optimized version of the G6Pase gene.\n\n  DTX301 (Avalotcagene Ontaparvovec) Exclusivity\n\n  We have an exclusive sub-license to a patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents expiring in 2035 (not accounting for any available PTE) and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering the codon-optimized version of the OTC gene used in DTX301; this patent family is owned by UPENN and sublicensed to us by REGENX.\n\n  UX143 (Setrusumab) Exclusivity\n\n  We have in-licensed rights from Mereo to patents and patent applications relating to setrusumab and its use for the treatment of OI. Pursuant to our license from Mereo, we have exclusive rights outside of Europe to a Mereo patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents and corresponding issued foreign patents that relate to the setrusumab antibody, nucleic acids encoding setrusumab, processes for producing setrusumab, and setrusumab’s use as a medicament. Patents emanating from this patent family expire in 2028 (not accounting for any available PTE). We also have exclusive rights outside of Europe to two additional Mereo patent families, including two issued U.S. patents expiring in 2037 (not accounting for any available PTE), relating to methods of using anti-sclerostin antibodies including setrusumab for the treatment of OI. Beyond these Mereo patents and patent applications, we jointly own with Mereo a patent family relating to dosing regimens for the use of anti-sclerostin antibodies including setrusumab in the treatment of OI; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2042 (not accounting for any available PTE). \n\n  UX111 (Rebisufligene Etisparvovec) Exclusivity \n\n  We have an exclusive license from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, or NCH, to a pending U.S. patent application covering a method of treating MPS IIIA by intravenously administering a recombinant AAV9 vector comprising a U1a promoter and a polynucleotide sequence encoding N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, or SGSH; we expect any patent emanating from this application to expire in 2032 (not accounting for any available PTE). \n\n  GTX-102 (Antisense Oligonucleotide) Exclusivity\n\n  We have an exclusive license from TAMU to a patent family filed in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions relating to UBE3A antisense oligonucleotides including GTX-102 and their use for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. The in-licensed TAMU patent family includes four issued U.S. patents expiring in 2038 (not accounting for any available PTE). Beyond the patent estate licensed from TAMU, we own a pending patent family relating to dosing regimens for the use of UBE3A antisense oligonucleotides including \n\n  16\n\n  GTX-102 in the treatment of Angelman syndrome; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2045 (not accounting for any available PTE).\n\n  UX701 (Rivunatpagene Miziparvovec) Exclusivity \n\n  We have two licenses to patents and patent applications covering elements of our UX701 product candidate. First, we have a license to a U.S. patent expiring in January 2026 which relates to the AAV9 capsid used in UX701; this patent is owned by UPENN and sublicensed to us by REGENX. Second, we have an exclusive license from UPENN to a patent family filed in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions relating to AAV vectors containing certain regulatory and coding sequences packaged in UX701; this patent family includes an issued U.S. patent expiring in 2039 (not accounting for any available PTE). Beyond these in-licenses, we own a patent family covering AAV vectors expressing a novel truncated version of the ATP7B protein produced by UX701; we expect any patents emanating from this patent family to expire in 2040 (not accounting for any available PTE). \n\n  Trademarks \n\n  We own registered trademarks covering the Ultragenyx word mark in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions. In addition, we have a pending trademark application in the U.S. covering a stylized design of our Ultragenyx logo. We also own registered trademarks in the U.S. and other territories relating to our Mepsevii and Dojolvi brand names for vestronidase alfa and triheptanoin, respectively. We additionally have licenses from KKC and Regeneron to registered trademarks covering the Crysvita and Evkeeza brand names, respectively, in territories where we have rights to commercialize these products.\n\n  Other \n\n  We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanisms including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.\n\n  Manufacturing \n\n  While we currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of most of our products and product candidates for use in preclinical, clinical, and commercial applications, 2024 was the first full year of Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, operation for our Gene Therapy Manufacturing Facility in Bedford, Massachusetts. This facility is focused on drug substance and drug product manufacturing of AAV gene therapy products and will support our clinical and commercial pipeline. This new capability combines with our existing gene therapy process and analytical development and QC lab capabilities in nearby Woburn, Massachusetts to form a fully integrated gene therapy development, manufacturing, and testing unit.\n\n  The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners has historically minimized our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. All of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales.\n\n  For the other non-gene therapy modalities, we primarily use third-party manufacturers to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.\n\n  Products\n\n  Mepsevii \n\n  The Mepsevii drug substance is manufactured by Rentschler Biopharma SE, or Rentschler, under non-exclusive commercial supply and services agreements. The cell line to produce Mepsevii is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available.\n\n  Crysvita \n\n  The drug substance and drug product for burosumab are made by KKC in Japan under the collaboration and license agreement and supply agreements with KKC. The cell line to produce burosumab is specific for this product and is in KKC’s control. All other raw materials are commercially available. \n\n  17\n\n  Dojolvi \n\n  The pharmaceutical-grade drug substance for Dojolvi is manufactured by IOI Oleo GmbH, or IOI Oleo, in Germany under an exclusive worldwide supply agreement.\n\n  In March 2023, the Dojolvi drug product manufacturer Aenova Haupt Pharma Wolfratshausen GmbH notified us of their intent to close the facility by the end of 2023. In response to this information, we produced additional DP batches prior to the facility closure at the end of 2023 and have identified a new DP manufacturer. We have completed the process performance validation activities and plan to submit the regulatory change in early 2025. Our current DP inventories are expected to support demand through at least the end of 2025.\n\n  Evkeeza \n\n  On January 7, 2022, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron for us to clinically develop, commercialize and distribute Evkeeza in countries outside of the U.S. Evkeeza is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of angiopoietin-like 3, or ANGPTL3, a protein that plays a key role in lipid metabolism.\n\n  The Evkeeza drug substance is manufactured by Regeneron at their manufacturing facility in Rensselaer, New York and the drug product is manufactured by Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions, LLC at their manufacturing facility in Bloomington, Indiana. Release testing of the drug product is performed by Regeneron and third-party suppliers.\n\n  We utilize third-party suppliers to perform packaging, labelling, distribution, and testing as needed for Evkeeza.\n\n  Product Candidates\n\n  The drug substances and drug products for our product candidates are manufactured using our network of GMP contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, which are carefully selected and actively managed for high quality, reliable clinical supply. The CMOs are located in Western Europe or North America.\n\n  Commercialization and Product Support \n\n  We have built our own commercial organizations in North America, Europe, Latin America and Japan to effectively support the commercialization of our products and product candidates, if approved. Our intention is to expand our product portfolio and its geographic accessibility through the continued development of our proprietary pipeline or through strategic partnerships. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract management organizations to assist in the commercialization of our products in certain geographies. The commercial infrastructure for rare disease products typically consists of a targeted, specialty field organization that educates a limited and focused group of physicians supported by field management and internal support teams, which includes marketing, patient support services, distribution, and market access. One challenge, unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases, is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous patient populations along with often undefined clinical or genetic tests to confirm diagnosis. Our commercial and medical affairs teams focus on maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases. \n\n  Additional capabilities important to the rare disease marketplace in the U.S. include the management of key stakeholders such as managed care organizations, specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and government payers. In many countries outside the U.S. single national payers are critical to providing reimbursement access. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest a significant amount of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to regulatory approval of the products that they are intended to support. \n\n  We continue to support commercial and medical affairs organizations as well as other capabilities across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Japan to meet the educational needs of the healthcare providers and patients in the rare disease community, focusing on providing accurate disease state information and balanced product information across our portfolio for appropriate management of patients with rare disorders.\n\n  Medical affairs is comprised of the following capabilities in support of our mission: medical information, patient advocacy, patient diagnosis liaisons, medical science liaisons, research and educational grants. Medical affairs will engage as early as Phase 1 and will continue work throughout the lifecycle of each product and product candidate as dictated by the specific scientific needs in each therapeutic area.\n\n  18\n\n  Government Regulation \n\n  Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state, and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Accordingly, our operations are and will be subject to a variety of regulations and other requirements, which vary from country to country. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources that has a significant impact on our capital expenditures and results of operations.\n\n  Global Regulation of Clinical Studies \n\n  Clinical studies involve the administration of an investigational medicinal product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with protocols, Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable regulatory requirements. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments are typically submitted to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities as part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, or clinical trial application, or CTA. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s institutional review board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB or EC must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. \n\n  The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. \n\n  •Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. \n\n  •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. \n\n  •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness, and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. \n\n  •Phase 4. In some cases, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. Regulatory authorities may condition approval of a marketing application for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.\n\n  A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but regulatory authorities may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. \n\n  U.S. Government Regulation \n\n  In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. \n\n  The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed or sold in the U.S. generally involves the following: \n\n  •completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act; \n\n  •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually; \n\n  19\n\n  •conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies that generally follow the three- to four-phase design described above to establish the safety and efficacy, or for BLA products, the safety, purity, and potency, of the product candidate for each proposed indication under an active IND and approved by an independent IRB representing each clinical site; \n\n  •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; \n\n  •potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; \n\n  •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with GMP;\n\n  •FDA inspection of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP; and \n\n  •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.\n\n  Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA \n\n  Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a significant application user fee, unless waived. \n\n  Pursuant to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of receipt. FDA procedures provide that the FDA will inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the requested additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before it is accepted for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.\n\n  Once an NDA or BLA has been accepted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. \n\n  The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA \n\n  The FDA may issue an approval letter if it finds the application has adequate support for commercial marketing. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may impose additional requirements, such as post-marketing studies and/or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, assessment plans, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. The FDA may also issue a Complete Response Letter, which indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If the conditions set forth in the Complete Response Letter are met, the FDA may approve the product for marketing. \n\n  Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs \n\n  A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs and BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast-track designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. \n\n  20\n\n  The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. The FDA may require, as appropriate, that such studies be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product that has been granted accelerated approval. The FDA also has authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a product or indication that was initially approved under accelerated approval if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, as a condition for accelerated approval, the FDA currently also requires pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\n\n  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, established the Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.\n\n  Furthermore, the FDA has made available expedited programs to sponsors of regenerative medicine therapies that have been granted designation as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT. Regenerative medicine therapies include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products and human cell and tissue products. A sponsor may seek RMAT designation if its regenerative medicine product is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the regenerative medicine therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, including potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints, and eligibility for rolling and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.\n\n  Orphan Designation and Exclusivity \n\n  Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA.\n\n  Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the U.S., except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.\n\n  There is some uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation of the scope of orphan drug exclusivity. Historically, exclusivity was specific to the orphan indication for which the drug was approved. As a result, the scope of exclusivity was interpreted as preventing approval of a competing product. However, in 2021, the federal court in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Becerra, suggested that orphan drug exclusivity covers the full scope of the orphan-designated “disease or condition” regardless of whether a drug obtained approval for a narrower use. \n\n  21\n\n  Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity \n\n  NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase 2 meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. \n\n  Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data. \n\n  Biosimilars and Exclusivity \n\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. \n\n  A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.\n\n  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, is intended to foster generic and biosimilar competition and to lower drug and biologic costs. The IRA provides the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, with significant new authorities. CMS is able to directly negotiate prescription drug prices and to cap out-of-pocket costs. Each year, CMS will select and negotiate a preset number of high-spend drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Parts B and D that lack generic or biosimilar competition. Price negotiations began in 2023. Effective from 2023, the IRA provides a new “inflation rebate” that covers Medicare patients and is intended to counter certain price increases in prescription drugs. The inflation rebate requires drug manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if the price for a drug or biologic under Medicare Parts B or D increases faster than the rate of inflation. To support biosimilar competition, qualifying biosimilars may receive a Medicare Part B payment increase for a period of five years, beginning in October 2022. Separately, if a biologic drug for which no biosimilar exists delays a biosimilar’s market entry beyond two years, CMS will be authorized to subject the biologics manufacturer to price negotiations intended to ensure fair competition. Notwithstanding these provisions, the IRA’s impact on competition and commercialization remains largely uncertain. \n\n  Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity\n\n  The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are bioequivalent (i.e. identical) to previously approved branded drugs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. \n\n  Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is bioequivalent to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, quality and performance characteristics, the strength of the drug, and intended use. \n\n  The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA or supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. \n\n  22\n\n  When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, it must certify, among other things, that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, which is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.\n\n  Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications\n\n  As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional bridging studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.\n\n  To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity (such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity) listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. \n\n  Patent Term Restoration\n\n  Some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Thus, for each approved product, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our related owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the original expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.\n\n  EU Regulation \n\n  In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, together the European Economic Area or EEA, after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. To obtain a MA, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The content of the MAA is similar to that of an NDA or BLA filed in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. \n\n  23\n\n  Authorization Procedures\n\n  Medicines can be authorized by using, among other things, a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized authorization procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission, or EC, following the scientific assessment of the application by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (for instance, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases). Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country; or (iii) they can be authorized in a EU member state in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure). \n\n  All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the Company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. RMPs are continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the medicine as new information becomes available. We need to submit an updated RMP: (i) at the request of EMA or a national competent authority, or (ii) whenever the risk-management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit-risk profile or as a result of an important pharmacovigilance or risk-minimization milestone being reached. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports, or PSURs, are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.\n\n  Special rules apply in part for ATMPs. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products, which are genes, cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation and that are administered to human beings in order to cure, diagnose or prevent diseases or regenerate, repair or replace a human tissue. Pursuant to the ATMP Regulation, the Committee on Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs. The manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long- term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although such guidelines are not legally binding, compliance with them is often necessary to gain and maintain approval for product candidates. In addition to the mandatory RMP, the holder of a MA for an ATMP must put in place and maintain a system to ensure that each individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport and delivery to the relevant healthcare institution where the product is used.\n\n  A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, and/or a request for waiver (for example, because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) or deferral (for example, until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available), is required for submission prior to submitting an MAA. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric studies and their timing relative to clinical studies in adults and an MAA must comply with the PIP to be validated.\n\n  MAA Review and Approval Timeframe and Accelerated Assessment \n\n  Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. In principle, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more. A favorable opinion on the application by the CHMP will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, and upon request by the applicant, the CHMP’s evaluation time frame is reduced to 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions.\n\n  24\n\n  MA Validity Period \n\n  MAs have an initial duration of five years. After five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.\n\n  Conduct of Clinical Trials \n\n  Clinical trials are studies intended to discover or verify the effects of one or more investigational medicines. The regulation of clinical trials aims to promote the protection of the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants and the credibility of the results of clinical trials. Regardless of where they are conducted, all clinical trials included in applications for marketing authorization for human medicines in the EU or EEA must have been carried out in accordance with EU regulations (such as, among others, the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) and the Clinical Trials Directive (EC) No 2001/20/EC). This means that clinical trials conducted in the EU or EEA have to comply with EU clinical trial legislation and that clinical trials conducted outside the EU or EEA have to comply with ethical principles equivalent to those set out in the EEA, including adhering to international good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n  Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval \n\n  Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. A conditional MA is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional MAs can be granted for medicinal products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the benefit/risk balance of the product is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data, (iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled by the grant of the MA and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Conditional MAs are valid for only one year and must be reviewed annually subject to certain specific obligations.\n\n  PRIME Program\n\n  PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. The program focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize development plans and the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enables accelerated assessment of medicines applications. PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.\n\n  25\n\n  Orphan Designation and Exclusivity\n\n  As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\n\n  New Chemical Entity Exclusivity \n\n  In the EU, new chemical entities, or NCEs, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon the product’s first MA in the EU and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to include an NCE. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could market a version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full MAA with its own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.\n\n  Post-Approval Requirements \n\n  Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval. \n\n  Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with GMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. \n\n  Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement \n\n  In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. \n\n  26\n\n  In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to patients. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.\n\n  Other Healthcare, Privacy, and Cybersecurity Laws and Compliance Requirements \n\n  We are subject to various laws targeting, among other things, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and privacy and protection of personal information, including health information. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: \n\n  •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving renumeration in return for, and from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration to induce, referrals of federal healthcare program patients and the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; \n\n  •federal, civil, and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent;\n\n  •federal, civil, and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; \n\n  •international data protection laws and regulations, including, but not limited, to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which apply to processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an entity established in a respective country, and to processing by an entity not established in a particular country, but where such processing is related to the offering of goods or services to, or the monitoring of the behavior of individuals located therein, and imposes requirements and limitations relating to the processing, storage, purpose of collection, accuracy, security, sharing and transfer of personal data, in particular with respect to special categories of personal data like health data, and the notification of supervisory authorities about data breaches, accompanied by sanctioning mechanisms—in addition to the GDPR, EU member states may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national implementing legislation;\n\n  •the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which introduced a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections for generic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, requiring disclosures about compassionate care programs, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products;\n\n  •the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to various healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals; and\n\n  •state and foreign law equivalents, or similar, of each of the above federal laws, such as transparency laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and privacy and security of health information laws, including comprehensive privacy and security laws in California. \n\n  Additional Regulation \n\n  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the UK or in EU member states, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In addition to these anti-corruption laws, we are subject to import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and regulatory limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets.\n\n  27\n\n  In addition, federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential obtained from consumers and individuals.\n\n  We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state, or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations. Complying with these requirements may have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and results of operations.\n\n  Customers\n\n  Our customers include collaboration partners, drug wholesalers, and retail pharmacy distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 49% of our total revenues were generated by our collaboration partner KKC.\n\n  Human Capital\n\n  General Information\n\n  As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,294 total employees, of which 875 are in research and development and 419 are in sales, general, and administrative. Further, 1,081 employees are based in the U.S., including at our facilities in Novato, California, Brisbane, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Woburn, Massachusetts, and 213 employees are based at our international locations. The majority of new employees hired during the year ended December 31, 2024 were to support and extend our clinical and preclinical pipeline, our in-house manufacturing capacities for our GTMF, as well as our commercialization activities, with hires in commercial, clinical development and operations, research, manufacturing, and general and administrative functions. We believe our relationship with our employees to be generally good. We have not experienced any material employment-related issues or interruptions of services due to labor disagreements and are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. \n\n  We expect to continue to strategically add employees in 2025 with a focus on increasing our commercial expertise and bandwidth for anticipated new product launches and expanding our geographic reach in connection with the global launches of our approved products. We continually evaluate our business need and opportunity and balances in-house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and certain drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers.\n\n  Workforce Safety and Employee Wellbeing\n\n  We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. Our health and safety management system includes several elements, such as incorporation of Global Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability standards, site-specific standard operating procedures, incident and safety observation reporting, hazard identification and risk assessments, job safety analyses, ergonomic assessments and industrial hygiene evaluations. We have adopted a flexible, hybrid working arrangement for our employees, which allows some of our employees to work remotely during certain days of the week. We provide our employees with wellness offerings to support their physical and mental health including our “Caring For U” program, a global reimbursement program offering employees up to $1,200 annually (in local currency) for wellness and caregiving activities.\n\n  Employee Retention and Engagement\n\n  The biotechnology industry is an extremely competitive labor market and we believe our company’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. We invest in the growth and development of our employees through various training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills, including leadership development programs tailored for new leaders as well as for more senior leaders, six sigma certification, as well as a mentoring program. We also have a talent management framework and processes in place that includes regularly conducted activities such as performance management, succession, and workforce planning in order to support our employees in their growth and development and to provide learning opportunities. We offer on-demand career coaching services through an external network of professional executive coaches. We encourage all employees to have an individual development plan to identify focus areas for learning and growth.\n\n  28\n\n  To regularly assess and improve our employee retention and engagement, we conduct an engagement survey approximately every 18 months, with \"pulse\" surveys in between, the results of which are discussed with our board of directors, at all hands employee meetings and in individual functions. We take actions to address areas of employment concern and follow-up routinely to share with employees what we are doing.\n\n  Culture \n\n  We are committed to fostering a healthy, inclusive environment while nurturing a culture of belonging where all employees have equal opportunities. We strive to create an environment where everyone we work with, serve, and engage with feels valued, respected, and empowered.\n\n  We have included questions in our engagement survey to measure employee perception of our inclusive culture, with the results from such survey on inclusion included in our corporate goals. Our business units review data related to hiring, promotions, and retention on an ongoing basis in order to promote inclusivity while maintaining our commitment to equal employment opportunities through merit-based decisions.\n\n  Benefits and Compensation\n\n  We are dedicated to fostering a workplace environment that keeps our employees inspired, including providing a comprehensive benefits program that supports the health care, family, and financial needs of our employees. All of our full-time employees are eligible for cash bonuses and equity awards in addition to other benefits including comprehensive health insurance, life and disability insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off for volunteering, wellness programs, and tuition reimbursement. We benchmark and tie compensation to market data as well as to an employee’s experience, function and performance. Our compensation structure includes performance-based elements, with the goal of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We regularly review our compensation policies and practices in an effort to identify and address any disparities or inequities.\n\n  General Information \n\n  Our Internet website address is www.ultragenyx.com.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\n  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following material risks, together with all the other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Our company’s business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and stock price. \n\n  Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\n  29\n\n  Risk Factor Summary\n\n  •We have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to

transactions.\n\n  •The market price of our common stock is highly volatile. \n\n  •Future sales and issuances of our common stock could dilute the percentage ownership of our current stockholders and result in a decline in stock price.\n\n  •Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us or could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\n\n  •We face general risks related to our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, additional tax liabilities related to our operations, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, costs of litigation, stockholder activism and increased scrutiny regarding our ESG practices and disclosures.\n\n  Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements \n\n  We have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term. \n\n  Since inception, we have been engaged in substantial research and development and capital investments, and we have operated at an operating loss each year and expect to continue doing so in the near term. While we currently expect to achieve profitability for the year 2027, our expectations are based on a variety of assumptions, and actual results, including whether we achieve profitability on our expected timeline or at all, may materially differ from our expectations. Our operating results, including our ability to achieve profitability, will depend, in part, on non-recurring events, the success of our commercialization efforts, and the rate of our future expenditures. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\n  •continue our research and nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; \n\n  •expand the scope of our current clinical studies for our product candidates; \n\n  •advance our programs into more expensive clinical studies; \n\n  •initiate additional nonclinical, clinical, or other studies for our product candidates; \n\n  •pursue preclinical and clinical development for additional indications for existing products and product candidates; \n\n  31\n\n  •change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers; \n\n  •expand upon our manufacturing-related facilities and capabilities, particularly as we continue to increase operations at our GMP gene therapy manufacturing facility;\n\n  •seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies; \n\n  •continue to establish Medical Affairs field teams to initiate relevant disease education;\n\n  •continue to establish or grow a marketing and distribution infrastructure and field force to commercialize our products and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n\n  •continue to manage our international subsidiaries and establish new ones;\n\n  •continue to operate as a public company and comply with legal, accounting and other regulatory requirements;\n\n  •seek to identify, assess, license, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates, technologies, and/or businesses; \n\n  •make milestone or other payments under any license or other agreements; \n\n  •seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; \n\n  •seek to attract and retain skilled personnel; \n\n  •create additional infrastructure, including facilities and systems, to support the growth of our operations, our product development, and our commercialization efforts; and\n\n  •experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including, but not limited to, failed studies, complex results, safety issues, inspection outcomes, or other regulatory challenges that require longer follow-up of existing studies, additional major studies, or additional supportive studies in order to pursue marketing approval.\n\n  Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or yearly basis. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. \n\n  We have limited experience in generating revenue from product sales. \n\n  Our ability to generate significant revenue from product sales depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize our products and to complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize, our product candidates. Our ability to generate substantial future revenue from product sales, including named patient sales, depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to: \n\n  •obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals with broad indications for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies; \n\n  •developing a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for our products and any approved product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can conduct the processes and provide adequate (in amount and quality) product supply to support market demand for our products and product candidates, if approved; \n\n  •launching and commercializing our products and product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor; \n\n  •obtaining market acceptance of our products and product candidates as viable treatment options; \n\n  •obtaining adequate market share, reimbursement and pricing for our products and product candidates;\n\n  •our ability to sell our products and product candidates on a named patient basis or through an equivalent mechanism and the amount of revenue generated from such sales;\n\n  •our ability to find patients so they can be diagnosed and begin receiving treatment;\n\n  •addressing any competing technological and market developments; \n\n  •negotiating favorable terms, including commercial rights, in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter, any amendments thereto or extensions thereof; \n\n  32\n\n  •maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and \n\n  •attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. \n\n  If the number of our addressable rare disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, or treatment guidelines, or any other reasons, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our products, even if they receive regulatory approval.\n\n  We may need to raise additional capital to fund our activities. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other activities. \n\n  As of December 31, 2024, our available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $745.0 million. We may need additional capital to continue to commercialize our products, and to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, all of our product candidates. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: \n\n  •the scope, rate of progress, results, and cost of our clinical studies, nonclinical testing, and other related activities; \n\n  •the cost of manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies of our products and product candidates; \n\n  •the cost of creating additional infrastructure, including facilities and systems, such as systems in our GMP gene therapy manufacturing facility; \n\n  •the cost of operating and maintaining our gene therapy manufacturing facility; \n\n  •the number and characteristics of the product candidates that we pursue; \n\n  •the cost, timing, and outcomes of regulatory approvals; \n\n  •the cost and timing of establishing and operating our international subsidiaries;\n\n  •the cost and timing of establishing and operating field forces, marketing, and distribution capabilities; \n\n  •the cost and timing of other activities needed to commercialize our products; and \n\n  •the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition, and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required milestone, royalty, and reimbursements or other payments thereunder.\n\n  Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management’s attention from their day-to-day activities, which can adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize our products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, particularly in light of the current macroeconomic conditions, including changing interest rates and inflation. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities by us, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. If we incur debt, it could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We have in the past sought and may in the future seek funds through a sale of future royalty payments similar to our transactions with Royalty Pharma and OMERS or through collaborative partnerships, strategic alliances, and licensing or other arrangements, such as our transaction with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., or Daiichi Sankyo, and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs, and other product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.\n\n  In addition, we purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of credit to corporations, institutions and governments. If any of the issuers or counterparties to these instruments were to default on their obligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.\n\n  33\n\n  If our cash flows are materially and adversely affected or if we are unable to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and/or are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of our products and any approved product candidates or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n  Risks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates \n\n  Clinical drug development involves a lengthy, complex, and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the potential for substantial delays, and the results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results. \n\n  Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, complex, time consuming, and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We have also had difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical staff for our studies, and may continue to experience such difficulties. Additionally, a failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks or fail in subsequent clinical studies. The safety or efficacy results generated to date in clinical studies do not ensure that later clinical studies will demonstrate similar results. Further, we have reported and expect to continue to report preliminary or interim data from our clinical trials. Preliminary or interim data from our clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. Such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be assessed and more patient data become available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects are no longer durable in patients and/or decrease over time or cease entirely. As a result, preliminary or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available. Results from investigator-sponsored studies or compassionate-use studies may not be confirmed in company-sponsored studies or may negatively impact the prospects for our programs. Additionally, given the nature of the rare diseases we are seeking to treat, we often devise newly-defined endpoints to be tested in our studies, which can lead to subjectivity in interpreting study results and could result in regulatory agencies not agreeing with the validity of our endpoints, or our interpretation of the clinical data, and therefore delaying or denying approval. Given the illness of the patients in our studies and the nature of their rare diseases, we have also been required to, or have chosen to, conduct certain studies on an open-label basis. We have in the past, and may in the future, elect to review interim clinical data at multiple time points during the studies, which could introduce bias into the study results and potentially result in denial of approval.\n\n  In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical studies. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies.\n\n  Scenarios that can prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\n  •delays or failures in generating sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation or continuation of human clinical studies or filings for regulatory approval; \n\n  •failure to demonstrate a starting dose for our product candidates in the clinic that might be reasonably expected to result in a clinical benefit;\n\n  •delays or failures in developing gene therapy, or other novel and complex product candidates, which are expensive and difficult to develop and manufacture;\n\n  •delays resulting from a shutdown, or uncertainty surrounding the potential for future shutdowns of the U.S. government, including the FDA;\n\n  •delays or failures in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design; \n\n  •delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical study sites, and other clinical trial-related vendors; \n\n  •failure or delays in obtaining required regulatory agency approval and/or IRB or EC approval at each clinical study site or in certain countries; \n\n  •failure to correctly design clinical studies which may result in those studies failing to meet their endpoints or the expectations of regulatory agencies;\n\n  34\n\n  •changes in clinical study design or development strategy resulting in delays related to obtaining approvals from IRBs or ECs and/or regulatory agencies to proceed with clinical studies; \n\n  •imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies after review of an IND application or amendment, another equivalent application or amendment, or an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites; \n\n  •delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies; \n\n  •difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators; \n\n  •failure by our CROs, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical study requirements; \n\n  •failure to perform in accordance with the FDA’s and/or ICH’s good clinical practices requirements or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries; \n\n  •delays in patients’ completion of studies or their returns for post-treatment follow-up; \n\n  •patients dropping out of a study; \n\n  •adverse events associated with the product candidate occurring that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; \n\n  •changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; \n\n  •greater than anticipated costs associated with clinical studies of our drug candidates, including as a result of inflation; \n\n  •clinical studies of our drug candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical or nonclinical studies or to abandon drug development programs; \n\n  •competing clinical studies of potential alternative product candidates or investigator-sponsored studies of our product candidates; and \n\n  •delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\n\n  Any inability to successfully complete nonclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional toxicology, comparability or other studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have commercial exclusivity and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain orphan exclusivity and to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\n\n  If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\n  For planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the timing of patient dosing, the timing, type or clarity of data from clinical trials, the submission or acceptance of regulatory filings, and the potential approval of such regulatory filings. We periodically make public announcements about the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions, but the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically from our estimates. If we do not meet these publicly announced milestones, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\n\n  We may find it difficult to identify and enroll patients in our clinical studies due to a variety of factors, including the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which our product candidates are being studied and other unforeseen events. Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates. \n\n  Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical studies if we encounter difficulties in enrollment.\n\n  Each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our current product candidates is a rare genetic disease. Accordingly, there are limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical studies. For example, we estimate that approximately 6,000 patients worldwide suffer from GSDIa, for which DTX401 is being studied, and these all may not be treatable if they are immune to the AAV viral vector.\n\n  35\n\n  In addition to the rarity of these diseases, the eligibility criteria of our clinical studies will further limit the pool of available study participants as we will require patients to have specific characteristics that we can measure or to assure their disease is either severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study. The process of finding and diagnosing patients is costly and time-consuming, especially since the rare diseases we are studying are commonly underdiagnosed. We also may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of appropriate patients to complete our clinical studies because of demographic criteria for prospective patients, the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients, and the patient referral practices of physicians. The availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical studies can also adversely impact enrollment. If patients are unwilling to participate in our studies for any reason (such as drug-related side effects), the timeline for and our success in recruiting patients, conducting studies, and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed or impaired, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product sales from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. Delays in completing our clinical studies will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\n\n  The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. Even if we achieve positive results in our pre-clinical and clinical studies, if we are ultimately unable to obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\n\n  Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize our products and develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize one or more product candidates. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We have only obtained regulatory approval for three products that we have developed, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Further, as the clinical trial requirements of regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the product candidates, the regulatory approval process for novel product candidates, such as our gene therapy product candidates, can be more expensive and take longer than for other product candidates, leading to fewer product approvals. To date, very few gene therapy products have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or Europe. The regulatory framework and oversight over development of gene therapy products has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued final guidance to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. The final guidance pertains to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. At the same time the FDA issued guidance describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. Within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, special rules apply to gene therapy and related products as they are considered advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. Pursuant to the ATMP Regulation, the Committee on Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs. The manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although such guidelines are not legally binding, compliance with them is often necessary to gain and maintain approval for product candidates. In addition to the mandatory risk-management plan, or RMP, the holder of a marketing authorization for an ATMP must put in place and maintain a system to ensure that each individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport, and delivery to the relevant healthcare institution where the product is used.\n\n  36\n\n  To obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we must comply with numerous and varying requirements regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical studies (including good clinical practices), commercial sales, pricing, and distribution of our product candidates, as described above in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation”. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in one jurisdiction, we cannot ensure that we will obtain approval in any other jurisdictions. In addition, approval policies, regulations, positions of the regulatory agencies on study design and/or endpoints, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. Communications with the regulatory agencies during the approval process are also unpredictable; favorable communications early in the process do not ensure that approval will be obtained and unfavorable communications early on do not guarantee that approval will be denied. Applications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval, or could be delayed in receiving regulatory approval, for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\n  •regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation, or conduct of our clinical studies; \n\n  •regulatory authorities may change their guidance or requirements for a development program for a product candidate;\n\n  •the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and safety in the full population for which we seek approval; \n\n  •regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical studies; \n\n  •the data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval; \n\n  •we may be unable to demonstrate to regulatory authorities that a product candidate’s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable; \n\n  •regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities used to manufacture our clinical and commercial supplies; \n\n  •the U.S. government may be shut down, which could delay the FDA;\n\n  •the FDA may be delayed in responding to our applications or submissions due to competing priorities or limited resources, including as a result of the lack of FDA funding or personnel;\n\n  •failure of our nonclinical or clinical development to comply with an agreed upon Pediatric Investigational Plan, or PIP, which details the designs and completion timelines for nonclinical and clinical studies and is a condition of marketing authorization in the EU; and \n\n  •the approval policies or regulations of regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. \n\n  Furthermore, the disease states we are evaluating often do not have clear regulatory paths for approval and/or do not have validated outcome measures. In these circumstances, we work closely with the regulatory authorities to define the approval path and may have to qualify outcome measures as part of our development programs. Additionally, many of the disease states we are targeting are highly heterogeneous in nature, which may impact our ability to determine the treatment benefit of our potential therapies. \n\n  This lengthy and uncertain approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the clinical and nonclinical studies, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, or delayed regulatory approval.\n\n  Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designations by the FDA, or access to the Priority Medicine scheme, or PRIME, by the EMA, for our product candidates, if granted, may not lead to \n\n  37\n\n  faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\n\n  As described in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation”, we seek Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or Priority Review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. Designation as a Fast Track product, Breakthrough Therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or Priority Review product is within the discretion of the relevant regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a Fast Track product, Breakthrough Therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or Priority Review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. The receipt of such a designation for a product candidate also may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure that the product will ultimately be approved by the regulatory authority. In addition, regarding Fast Track products and Breakthrough Therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a Fast Track product, RMAT, or a Breakthrough Therapy or, for Priority Review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, with respect to PRIME designation by the EMA, PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.\n\n  The FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, or PRV Voucher Program, awards Priority Review Vouchers, or PRVs, to sponsors of rare pediatric product applications that meet certain criteria. Under the program, a company that receives an approval for a product for a rare pediatric disease (as determined by the applicable regulations) may qualify for a PRV that can be redeemed to receive Priority Review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. PRVs may also be sold by the company to third parties. We received PRVs under the PRV Voucher Program in connection with the approval of Mepsevii and Crysvita in 2018 and subsequently sold these two PRVs to third parties for an average amount of $105.3 million for each PRV. The PRV Voucher Program began to sunset on December 20, 2024 such that the FDA may only award a PRV for a product application if a company received the rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for the product candidate by December 20, 2024 and the FDA will cease awarding PRVs after September 30, 2026. Renewal of the PRV Voucher Program is subject to approval by Congress and it is currently uncertain whether the program will be renewed and whether any such renewal will be retroactively effective. If the PRV program is not renewed by Congress and our qualifying product candidates are approved by the FDA after the deadline of September 30, 2026, we will not be eligible to receive additional PRVs for our product candidates and accordingly, we would be unable to use such PRV for Priority Review for another one of our programs or to sell such PRV, which sale has the potential to generate significant proceeds.\n\n  Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. \n\n  Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical studies or further development, and could result in a more restrictive label, the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities, or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, restricted distribution, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use. Our product candidates are in development and the safety profile has not been established. Further, as one of the goals of Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 clinical trials is to identify the highest dose of treatment that can be safely provided to study participants, adverse side effects, including serious adverse effects, have occurred in certain studies as a result of changes to the dosing regimen during such studies and may occur in future studies. Results of our studies or investigator-sponsored trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our studies could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny or withdraw approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. \n\n  Additionally, notwithstanding our prior or future regulatory approvals for our product candidates, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\n  •regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product; \n\n  •regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the product’s label or restrict the product’s approved use; \n\n  •we may be required to create a REMS plan; \n\n  •we may be required to change the way the product is administered;\n\n  38\n\n  •patients and physicians may elect not to use our products, or reimbursement authorities may elect not to reimburse for them; and \n\n  •our reputation may suffer. \n\n  Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved. \n\n  Serious adverse events in clinical trials involving gene therapy product candidates may damage public perception of the safety of our product candidates, increase government regulation, and adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates or conduct our business.\n\n  Gene therapy remains a novel technology. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. For example, certain gene therapy trials using AAV8 vectors (although at significantly higher doses than those used in our gene therapy product candidates) and other vectors led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia and death. The risk of cancer or death remains a concern for gene therapy and there can be no assurance that it will not occur in any of our planned or future clinical studies. In addition, there is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products, particularly AAV gene therapy products such as candidates based on the same capsid serotypes as our product candidates, or occurring during use of our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our gene therapy product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those gene therapy product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such gene therapy product candidates. \n\n  Gene therapy product candidates are novel, complex, expensive and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in developing and commercializing these programs or otherwise harm our business. \n\n  The manufacturing process used to produce our gene therapy product candidates is novel, complex, and has not been validated for commercial use. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, malfunctions of internal information technology systems, regulatory inspections, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, geopolitical instability, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. Further, given that cGMP gene therapy manufacturing is a nascent industry, there are a small number of CMOs with the experience necessary to manufacture our gene therapy product candidates and we may have difficulty finding or maintaining relationships with such CMOs or hiring experts for internal manufacturing and accordingly, our production capacity may be limited.\n\n  Our gene therapy product candidates require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most small molecule drugs. Moreover, unlike small molecules, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as gene therapy product candidates generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product candidate may not be sufficient to ensure that the product candidate is consistent from lot to lot or will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control the manufacturing process to assure that the process works reproducibly, and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, noncompliance with regulatory requirements, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, the EMA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\n\n  In addition, FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay product launches or clinical trials, which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \n\n  Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our products remain subject to regulatory scrutiny. \n\n  39\n\n  Our products and any product candidates that are approved in the future remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the U.S. and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, as described above in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation”. \n\n  Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authority, requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and inspection to assess compliance with GMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA, BLA, MAA, or other comparable application for approval in another jurisdiction. Although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations. Regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our products, product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates, we or any of our collaborators or contract manufacturers may be unable to comply with GMP regulations in a cost-effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass a federal, national or international regulatory inspection. If we, our collaborators, such as KKC or Regeneron, or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales, recalls or seizures of product or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility or withdrawal of product approval, enforcement actions and criminal or civil prosecution. If supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted due to failure to maintain regulatory compliance, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through an NDA or BLA supplement or MAA variation, or equivalent foreign regulatory filing, which could result in delays in product supply. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer, material, testing method or standard is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers, materials, test methods or standards may involve substantial costs and may result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work are required continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control.\n\n  Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or other conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical studies, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. We could also be asked to conduct post-marketing clinical studies to verify the safety and efficacy of our products in general or in specific patient subsets. If original marketing approval was obtained via the accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization pathways, we would be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical study to confirm clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval. We will be required to report certain adverse events and manufacturing problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The holder of an approved NDA, BLA, MAA, or other comparable application must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. \n\n  If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or there are safety or efficacy problems with a product, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things: \n\n  •issue warning or notice of violation letters; \n\n  •impose civil or criminal penalties; \n\n  •suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; \n\n  •suspend any of our ongoing clinical studies; \n\n  •refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us; \n\n  •impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers’ facilities; \n\n  •seize or detain products, or require a product recall; or\n\n  •require entry into a consent decree.\n\n  Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. \n\n  40\n\n  Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of our approved products or product candidates. \n\n  We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our approved products and product candidates in human clinical trials, as well as in connection with commercialization of our current and future products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that any of our approved products or product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. There can be no assurance that our product liability insurance, which provides coverage in the amount of $15.0 million in the aggregate, will be sufficient in light of our current or planned clinical programs. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability, or losses may exceed the amount of insurance that we carry. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in impairment of our business reputation, withdrawal of clinical study participants, costs due to related litigation, distraction of management’s attention from our primary business, initiation of investigations by regulators, substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants, the inability to commercialize our product candidates, and decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\n\n  If we are unable to identify, source, and develop effective biomarkers, or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates.\n\n  We are developing companion diagnostic tests to identify the right patients for certain of our product candidates and to monitor response to treatment. In certain cases, diagnostic tests may need to be developed as companion diagnostics and regulatory approval obtained in order to commercialize some product candidates. We currently use and expect to continue to use biomarkers to identify the right patients for certain of our product candidates. We may also need to develop predictive biomarkers in the future. We can offer no assurances that any current or future potential biomarker will in fact prove predictive, be reliably measured, or be accepted as a measure of efficacy by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, our success may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of companion diagnostics. We also expect the FDA will require the development and regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic assay as a condition to approval of our gene therapy product candidates. There has been limited success to date industrywide in developing and commercializing these types of companion diagnostics. Development and manufacturing of companion diagnostics is complex and there are limited manufacturers with the necessary expertise and capability. Even if we are able to successfully develop companion diagnostics, we may not be able to manufacture the companion diagnostics at a cost or in quantities or on timelines necessary for use with our product candidates. To be successful, we need to address a number of scientific, technical and logistical challenges. We are currently working with a third party to develop companion diagnostics, however, we have little experience in the development and commercialization of diagnostics and may not ultimately be successful in developing and commercializing appropriate diagnostics to pair with any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. We rely on third parties for the automation, characterization and validation, of our bioanalytical assays, companion diagnostics and the manufacture of critical reagents.\n\n  Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the U.S. as medical devices and require regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization. In the U.S., companion diagnostics are cleared or approved through FDA’s 510(k) premarket notification or premarket approval, or PMA, process. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted 510(k) premarket notification, PMA or equivalent application types in jurisdictions outside the U.S., may cause delays in the approval, clearance or rejection of an application. Given our limited experience in developing and commercializing diagnostics, we expect to rely in part or in whole on third parties for companion diagnostic design and commercialization. We and our collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval or clearance for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by us or our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates.\n\n  41\n\n  Risks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties \n\n  We rely on third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may be exposed to sub-optimal quality and reputational harm, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed. \n\n  We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third parties, including CROs, collaborative partners, and independent investigators to analyze, collect, monitor, and manage data for our ongoing nonclinical and clinical programs. We rely on third parties for execution of our nonclinical and clinical studies, and for estimates regarding costs and efforts completed, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs and other vendors and partners are required to comply with GMP, GCP, and GLP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators, study sites, and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or other vendors and partners, including the sites at which clinical studies are conducted, fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our nonclinical and clinical studies may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may deny approval and/or require us to perform additional nonclinical and clinical studies before approving our marketing applications, which would delay the approval process. We cannot make assurances that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical studies comply with GCP regulations or that nonclinical studies comply with GLP regulations. In addition, our clinical studies must be conducted with products produced under GMP regulations. If the regulatory authorities determine that we have failed to comply with GLP, GMP, or GCP regulations, they may deny approval of our product candidates and/or we may be required to repeat clinical or nonclinical studies, which would delay the regulatory approval process. \n\n  Our CROs and other vendors and partners are not our employees, and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going nonclinical and clinical programs, except for the limited remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our vendors and partners do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. CROs and other vendors and partners have also generated higher costs than anticipated as a result of changes in scope of work or otherwise. As a result, the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. \n\n  If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional vendors involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new vendor commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Our efforts to manage our relationships with our vendors and partners can provide no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and business prospects. \n\n  We also rely on third parties in other ways, including efforts to support patient diagnosis and identify patients, to assist our finance and legal departments, and to provide other resources for our business. Use of these third parties could expose us to sub-optimal quality, missed deadlines, and non-compliance with applicable laws, all of which could result in reputational harm to us and negatively affect our business.\n\n  42\n\n  We are dependent on KKC for the commercialization of Crysvita in our markets, including the U.S. and Canada, and for our supply of Crysvita in our markets. Failure by KKC to commercialize Crysvita in those markets, or to supply Crysvita to us, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. \n\n  Pursuant to the terms of our collaboration and license agreement with KKC, or the collaboration agreement, commercialization responsibilities for Crysvita in the U.S. and Canada transitioned from us to KKC in April 2023. KKC also has the sole right to commercialize Crysvita in Europe and, at certain specified times, in Turkey, subject to certain rights retained. A substantial portion of our total revenue has been based on revenue from Crysvita, including royalty revenue we receive from KKC for sales of the product in the U.S. and Canada. The commercial success of Crysvita in territories in which KKC owns commercialization responsibilities, such as in the U.S. and Canada depends on, among other things, the efforts and allocation of resources of KKC in those territories, which we do not control. KKC has no obligation under the collaboration agreement to use diligent efforts to commercialize Crysvita in those territories. Our partnership with KKC may not be successful, and we may not realize the expected benefits from such partnership, due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to the following: \n\n  •KKC may change the focus of its commercialization efforts or pursue higher priority programs; \n\n  •KKC may make decisions regarding the indications for our product candidates in countries where it has the sole right to commercialize the product candidates that limit commercialization efforts in those countries or in countries where we have the right to commercialize our product candidates; \n\n  •KKC may make decisions regarding market access and pricing in countries where it has the sole right to commercialize our product candidates which can negatively impact our commercialization efforts in countries where we have the right to commercialize our product candidates;\n\n  •KKC may fail to manufacture or supply sufficient drug product of Crysvita in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or otherwise for our development and clinical use or commercial use, which could result in program delays or lost revenue;\n\n  •KKC may elect to develop and commercialize Crysvita indications with a larger market than XLH and at a lower price, thereby reducing the profit margin on sales of Crysvita for any orphan indications, including XLH; \n\n  •if KKC were to breach or terminate the agreement with us, we would no longer have any rights to develop or commercialize Crysvita or such rights would be limited to non-terminated countries; \n\n  •KKC may terminate its agreement with us, adversely affecting our potential revenue from licensed products; and \n\n  •the timing and amounts of expense reimbursement that we may receive are uncertain, and the total expenses for which we are obligated to reimburse KKC may be greater than anticipated. \n\n  We rely on third parties to manufacture our products and our product candidates and we are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit the supply of our products and product candidates. \n\n  As we currently lack the resources and the full capability to manufacture all of our products and product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale, we rely on third parties to manufacture, store and distribute our products and product candidates. Although we oversee the contract manufacturers, we cannot control the manufacturing process of, and are substantially dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements. See the risk factor above entitled “- Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our products remain subject to regulatory scrutiny”. Further, we depend on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our products and product candidates. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs, placebos, or active controls, and there may be a need to identify alternate suppliers to prevent or mitigate a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our products and product candidates for our clinical studies, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. We also do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. We may also experience interruptions in supply of product if the product or raw material components fail to meet our quality control standards or the quality control standards of our suppliers. \n\n  Further, manufacturers that produce our products and product candidates may not have experience producing our products and product candidates at commercial levels and may not produce our products and product candidates at the cost, quality, quantities, locations, and timing needed to support profitable commercialization. We have not yet secured manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of all of our product candidates and may be unable to negotiate binding agreements with manufacturers to support our commercialization activities on commercially reasonable terms. Even if our third-party product manufacturers develop acceptable manufacturing processes that provide the necessary quantities of our products and product candidates in a compliant and timely manner, the cost to us for the supply of our products and product candidates manufactured by \n\n  43\n\n  such third parties may be high and could limit our profitability. For instance, KKC is our sole supplier of commercial quantities of Crysvita. The supply price to us for commercial sales of Crysvita in Latin America is 30% of net sales, which is higher than the typical cost of sales for companies focused on rare diseases.\n\n  The process of manufacturing our products and product candidates is complex, highly regulated, and subject to several risks, including but not limited to those listed below. \n\n  •The process of manufacturing our products and product candidates is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes for our products and any of our product candidates could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our products and product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products and product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.\n\n  •The manufacturing facilities in which our products and product candidates are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, raw material shortages, natural disasters, power failures, actual or threatened public health emergencies, and numerous other factors. \n\n  Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products and product candidates may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products and product candidates. Due to their stage of development, small volume requirements, and infrequency of batch production runs, we carry limited amounts of safety stock for our products and product candidates. We have, and may in the future, be required to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products and product candidates that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts, or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\n\n  The drug substance and drug product for our products and most of our product candidates are currently acquired from single-source suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with the necessary drug substance or drug product, could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n  We acquire most of the drug substances and drug products for our products and product candidates from single sources. If any single source supplier breaches an agreement with us, or terminates the agreement in response to an alleged breach by us, ceases operations, is acquired, enters into exclusive arrangements with a competitor or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill its supply obligations, we would not be able to manufacture and distribute the product or product candidate until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could significantly impair our ability to commercialize such product or delay the development of such product candidate. For example, the drug substance and drug product for Crysvita and Evkeeza are made, respectively, by KKC pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement and supply agreements and Regeneron pursuant to a supply agreement. Further, single source suppliers are also used for our gene therapy programs and for Dojolvi, for which we are in the process of qualifying our alternative supplier. We cannot provide assurances that qualifying alternate sources, if available at all, for any of our drug substances and drug products, and establishing relationships with such sources would not result in significant expense, supply disruptions or delay in the commercialization of our products or the development of our product candidates. Additionally, we may not be able to enter into supply arrangements with an alternative supplier on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of any new agreement may also be less favorable or more costly than the terms we have with our current supplier. A delay in the commercialization of our products or the development of our product candidates or having to enter into a new agreement with a different third-party on less favorable terms than we have with our current suppliers could have a material adverse impact upon on our business. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions with China including the Congressional legislative proposal, titled the BIOSECURE Act, which would, among other things, prohibit U.S. federal funding in connection with biotechnology equipment or services produced or provided by Chinese biotechnology companies, and the recent requests by certain Congressional leaders that WuXi AppTech Co. and its affiliates be added to certain U.S. Government restricted entity lists, could lead to our competitors and other companies moving to suppliers outside of China, including to our current suppliers. Significant increases in business at our single source suppliers resulting from such activities could adversely limit capacity at such suppliers to manufacture our products or result in price increases, interruptions or delays of our products.\n\n  44\n\n  The actions of distributors and specialty pharmacies could affect our ability to sell or market products profitably. Fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns by such distributors and specialty pharmacies could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\n  We rely on commercial distributors and specialty pharmacies for a considerable portion of our product sales and such sales are concentrated within a small number of distributors and specialty pharmacies. The financial failure of any of these parties could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations. Our revenues, financial condition or results of operations may also be affected by fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns of such distributors and specialty pharmacies. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler inventory objectives, or other factors. \n\n  Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Products and Product Candidates \n\n  If the market opportunities for our products and product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. Because the target patient populations of our products and product candidates are small, and the addressable patient population potentially even smaller, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth. \n\n  We focus our research and product development on treatments for rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. Given the small number of patients who have the diseases that we are targeting, it is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we continue to successfully identify patients with these rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. Some of our current products or clinical programs may also be most appropriate for patients with more severe forms of their disease. For instance, while adults make up the majority of the XLH patients, they often have less severe disease that may reduce the penetration of Crysvita in the adult population relative to the pediatric population. Given the overall rarity of the diseases we target, it is difficult to project the prevalence of the more severe forms, or the other subsets of patients that may be most suitable to address with our products and product candidates, which may further limit the addressable patient population to a small subset. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our products and product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our products and product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our products and product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or access. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for our products and product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small, we may never become or remain profitable nor generate sufficient revenue growth to sustain our business.\n\n  We face intense competition and rapid technological change, including the use of artificial intelligence, or AI, and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are similar, more advanced, or more effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. \n\n  The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We are currently aware of various existing treatments that may compete with our products and product candidates. See “Item 1. Business – Competition” above. \n\n  45\n\n  We have competitors both in the U.S. and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, startups, academic research institutions, government agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can often result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization, and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential products and product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our products and product candidates against competitors. Moreover, we also face increased competition from other companies that are using AI, some of whom may be able to more quickly and effectively identify and develop novel drug candidates compared to us and our business partners, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\n  We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our organization, including building an integrated commercial organization. If we are unable to expand our existing commercial infrastructure or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products and product candidates, as needed, we may be unable to increase our revenue. \n\n  We expect to need additional managerial, operational, marketing, financial, legal, and other resources to support our development and commercialization plans and strategies. In order to successfully commercialize our products as well as any additional products that may result from our development programs or that we acquire or license from third parties, we expect to expand our commercial team in the United States as well as in Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. This infrastructure consists of both office-based as well as field teams with technical expertise, and is expected to be expanded as we approach the potential approval dates of additional products that result from our development programs. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. \n\n  We, as a company, have limited, experience selling and marketing our product and only some of our employees have prior experience promoting other similar products while employed at other companies. As we increase the number and range of our commercialized products, we may experience additional complexities in our sales process and strategy and may encounter difficulties in allocating sufficient resources to sales and marketing of certain products. Further, as we launch additional products or as demand for our products change, our initial estimate of the size of the required field force may be materially more or less than the size of the field force actually required to effectively commercialize our product candidates. As such, we may be required to hire larger teams to adequately support the commercialization of our products and product candidates or we may incur excess costs in an effort to optimize the hiring of commercial personnel. With respect to certain geographical markets, we may enter into collaborations with other entities to utilize their local marketing and distribution capabilities, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If our future collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products, if any, and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product sales to sustain our business. We face competition from companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without a large internal team or the support of a third party to perform key commercial functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\n\n  46\n\n  The commercial success of any current or future product will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. \n\n  Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of our current and future products will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and payors accepting our current and future products as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, payors, and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our current and future products will depend on a number of factors, including: \n\n  •the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical studies and potential advantages over competing treatments; \n\n  •the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling; \n\n  •the clinical indications for which approval is granted; \n\n  •relative convenience and ease of administration; \n\n  •the cost of treatment, particularly in relation to competing treatments; \n\n  •the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; \n\n  •the effectiveness of our field forces and marketing efforts;\n\n  •the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products; \n\n  •publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and \n\n  •sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement. \n\n  Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in nonclinical and clinical studies, market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and payors on the benefits of the product candidates require significant resources and may never be successful. If our current and future products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, payors, and others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\n\n  The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue. \n\n  Our target patient populations are small, and accordingly the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of our products and product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support our commercial infrastructure. Our per-patient prices must be sufficient to recover our development and manufacturing costs and potentially achieve profitability. We expect the cost of a single administration of gene therapy products, such as those we are developing, to be substantial, when and if they achieve regulatory approval. Accordingly, the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental and private payors are essential for most patients to afford expensive treatments such as ours, assuming approval. Sales of our products and product candidates, if approved, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which their costs will be paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government authorities, private health insurers, and other payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, are available only to limited levels, or are not available on a timely basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved. For example, deteriorating economic conditions and political instability in certain Latin American countries and in Turkey continue to cause us to experience significant delays in receiving approval for reimbursement for our products and consequently impact our product commercialization timelines in such regions. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to sustain our overall enterprise. In addition, we do not know the reimbursement rates until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates.\n\n  There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, decides whether and to what extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS or private payors will decide with respect to reimbursement for products such as ours, especially our gene therapy product candidates as there is a limited body of established practices and precedents for gene therapy products. \n\n  47\n\n  Outside the U.S., international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries will put pressure on the pricing and usage of our products and product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in foreign markets, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the U.S. and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits. The timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is highly uncertain, and in some countries outside of the U.S., we expect the process to exceed several months. Even if a price can be negotiated, countries frequently request or require reductions to the price and other concessions over time, including retrospective “clawback” price reductions. Additionally, member states of the EU have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measures for pharmaceuticals such as volume discounts, cost caps, clawbacks and free products for a portion of the expected therapy period. For example, in France, we estimate clawback reserves on Dojolvi and Evkeeza based on current regulations, our estimate of pricing on approval of Dojolvi and Evkeeza and other factors. However, if pricing is approved at levels lower than estimated, if at all, or if there are further changes in the regulatory framework, we may be required to pay back amounts higher than clawback reserves and reverse revenue that has been previously recorded.\n\n  Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products and product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our products and product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative changes, including the impact from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and statements by elected officials. For example, proposals have been discussed to tie U.S. drug prices to the cost in other countries, several states in the U.S. have introduced legislation to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose their costs to justify the prices of their products. Drug pricing is also expected to remain a focus for the current Presidential Administration and Congress. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and with respect to prescription drugs, surgical procedures, and other treatments in particular, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\n\n  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property \n\n  If we are unable to obtain and maintain effective patent rights for our products, product candidates, or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets. \n\n  We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies, our products, and our product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors’ ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the U.S. and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technologies, our products, and our product candidates. \n\n  We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies, products and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. \n\n  The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsettled. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our products or product candidates in the U.S. or in foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application or provide the basis for third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, or scope of any issued patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable, or invalidated. Furthermore, even if the patents and patent applications we own or in-license are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our products or product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties. \n\n  48\n\n  We, independently or together with our licensors, have filed several patent applications covering various aspects of our products or product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patent applications will issue, the breadth of any issued patent, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents could impair the exclusivity position of our products or deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that are approved. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. \n\n  Our current patents or applications covering methods of use and certain compositions of matter do not provide complete patent protection for our products and product candidates in all territories. For example, there are no issued patents covering the Crysvita composition of matter in Latin America, where we have rights to commercialize this product. Therefore, a competitor could develop the same antibody or a similar antibody as well as other approaches that target FGF23 for potential commercialization in Latin America, subject to any intellectual property rights or regulatory exclusivities awarded to us. If we cannot obtain and maintain effective patent rights for our products or product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\n\n  We may not have sufficient patent terms to effectively protect our products and business. \n\n  Patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest non-provisional filing date. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our products or product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic or biosimilar medications.\n\n  Patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the U.S. and under supplementary protection certificates in Europe may not be available to extend the patent exclusivity term for our products and product candidates, and we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension will be obtained and, if so, for how long. Furthermore, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we do not have sufficient patent terms or regulatory exclusivity to protect our products, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\n  Patent law and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. \n\n  Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We therefore cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and in-licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. \n\n  In 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law and introduced significant changes to the prosecution of U.S. patent applications and to the procedures for challenging U.S. patents. The effects of these changes remain unclear owing to the evolving nature of the law and the lengthy timelines associated with court system review and interpretation. Consequently, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n  Outside the U.S., there have been changes to patent laws in certain jurisdictions that could impair our ability to obtain, maintain, or enforce our patents in those territories. For instance, Europe’s new Unitary Patent system and Unified Patent Court, or the UPC, may present uncertainties for our ability to protect and enforce our patent rights against competitors in Europe. In 2012, as part of the European Patent Package, or the EU Patent Package, regulations were passed with the goal of providing a single pan-European Unitary Patent system and a new UPC, for litigation involving European patents. Implementation of the EU Patent Package occurred in June 2023. Under the UPC, all European patents, including those issued prior to ratification of the European Patent Package, will by default automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC. The UPC will provide our competitors with a new forum in which to seek central revocation of our European patents and allow for the possibility of a competitor to obtain pan-European injunctions. It will be several years before we will understand the scope of patent rights that will be recognized and the strength of patent remedies that will be provided by the UPC. Under the EU Patent Package, we will have the right to opt our patents out of the UPC over the first seven years of the court’s existence, but doing so may preclude us from realizing the benefits of the new unified court.\n\n  49\n\n  If we are unable to maintain effective proprietary rights for our products, product candidates, or any future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets. \n\n  In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our products or product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. The confidentiality agreements entered into with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and other third parties that we rely on in connection with the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary technology and processes, which increase the risk that such trade secrets may become known by our competitors or may be inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others.\n\n  The physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems may not preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets. These individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. \n\n  The assignment agreements we enter into with our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and the confidentiality agreements we enter into with our employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology may not have been duly executed and we cannot assure that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. \n\n  Claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\n\n  Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of others. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews, oppositions, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by other parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products or product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of these other parties. \n\n  Other parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment relevant to the use or manufacture of our products or product candidates. We have conducted freedom to operate analyses with respect only to our products and certain of our product candidates, and therefore we do not know whether there are any patents of other parties that would impair our ability to commercialize all of our product candidates. We also cannot guarantee that any of our analyses are complete and thorough, nor can we be sure that we have identified each and every patent and pending application in the U.S. and abroad that covers technology relevant or necessary to the commercialization of our products or product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that are relevant to our products or product candidates. \n\n  We are aware of certain U.S. and foreign patents owned by third parties that a court might construe to be valid and relevant to one or more of our gene therapy product candidates, certain methods that may be used in their manufacture or delivery, or certain formulations comprising one or more of our gene therapy candidates. Regarding our anti-sclerostin antibody product candidate, setrusumab, we are aware of litigation involving patents owned by a third-party, OssiFi-Mab LLC, or OMab, relating to methods of using sclerostin antagonists in combination with antiresorptive drugs to increase bone growth, bone formation, and/or bone density. Specifically, in the U.S., OMab has asserted certain patents expiring in 2027 or 2028 against Amgen based on Amgen’s commercialization of an anti-sclerostin antibody, Evenity®, for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture; Amgen denies infringement and asserts the OMab patents are invalid. In Europe, OMab was granted two patents with related subject matter; the first patent has been revoked while the second has been opposed by Amgen, UCB, and two anonymous parties. There is a risk that one or more third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that one or more of these patents is valid, enforceable, and infringed, in which case the owners of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize a product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. However, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\n  50\n\n  Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to continue commercialization of our products, or block our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products, or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\n\n  We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses. \n\n  Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license, or use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. \n\n  We sometimes collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. \n\n  If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the corresponding program. \n\n  We may face competition from biosimilars, which may have a material adverse impact on the future commercial prospects of our biological products and product candidates.\n\n  Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face competition from biosimilars with respect to our biological products (Crysvita, Mepsevii and Evkeeza) and our biological product candidates. In the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, was included in the Affordable Care Act and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar,” or biosimilar, to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-approved biological product. The BPCI Act prohibits the FDA from approving a biosimilar or interchangeable product that references a brand biological product until 12 years after the licensure of the reference product, but permits submission of an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product to the FDA four years after the reference product was first licensed. The BPCI Act does not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating its own data, and seeking approval. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. Moreover, aspects of the law are still being evaluated and interpreted by courts. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. Modification of the BPCI Act, or changes to the interpretation or implementation of the BPCI Act, could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products and product candidates. \n\n  In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In Europe, a competitor may reference data supporting approval of an innovative biological product, but will not be able to get on the market until 10 years after the time of approval of the innovative product. This 10-year marketing exclusivity period will be extended to 11 years if, during the first eight of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications that bring significant clinical benefits compared with existing therapies. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. \n\n  51\n\n  If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products, our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences\n\n  Competitors could enter the market with generic versions of Dojolvi or our small-molecule product candidates, which may result in a material decline in sales of affected products. \n\n  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved, innovator small-molecule product such as Dojolvi. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) that references the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness of a previously approved innovator small-molecule product. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. Innovative small-molecule drugs may be eligible for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity (e.g., five years for new chemical entities, three years for changes to an approved drug requiring a new clinical study, and seven years for orphan drugs), which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review of) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA relying on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for the innovative drug. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the “Orange Book.” If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in the ANDA or 505(b)(2) what is known as a “Paragraph IV certification,” challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the innovator, too, and if within 45 days of receiving notice the innovator sues to enforce its patents, approval of the ANDA is stayed for 30 months, or as lengthened or shortened by the court. \n\n  During the year ended December 31, 2024, Navinta, Aurobindo, and Esjay filed ANDAs for generic versions of Dojolvi. We have filed a patent infringement suit under the Hatch-Waxman Act against Navinta, Aurobindo and Esjay in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to the notices. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” below for a description of our suit. We cannot predict the outcome of our suit, nor can we predict whether there will be additional ANDA filings for Dojolvi. \n\n  There have been a number of recent regulatory and legislative initiatives designed to encourage generic competition for small-molecule pharmaceutical products. For instance, in December 2019, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, or the CREATES Act, was enacted, which provides a legislatively defined private right of action under which eligible product developers can bring suit against companies who refuse to sell sufficient quantities of their branded products on commercially reasonable, market-based terms to support such eligible product developers’ marketing applications. It is our policy to evaluate requests for samples of our branded products, and to provide samples in response to bona fide, CREATES Act-compliant requests from qualified third parties, including generic manufacturers. \n\n  We may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any patents that are granted and listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, the affected product could more immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline materially. For instance, if the existing ANDA filers or additional competitors are able to enter the market with generic versions of Dojolvi, our sales of Dojolvi could materially decline which could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\n  The patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our products and product candidates is dependent on third parties. \n\n  While we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our products or product candidates, there may be times when patents relating to our products or product candidates are controlled by our licensors. This is the case with our license agreements with KKC and Regeneron, who are primarily responsible for the prosecution of certain patents and patent applications covering Crysvita and Evkeeza, respectively. \n\n  In addition, we have in-licensed various patents and patent applications owned by the University of Pennsylvania relating to our DTX301, DTX401 and/or UX701 product candidates. Some of these patents and patent applications are licensed or sublicensed by REGENX and sublicensed to us. We do not have the right to control the prosecution of these patent applications, or the maintenance of any of these patents. In addition, under our agreement with REGENX, we do not have the first right to enforce the licensed patents, and our enforcement rights are subject to certain limitations that may adversely impact our ability to use the licensed patents to exclude others from commercializing competitive products. Moreover, REGENX and the University of Pennsylvania may have interests which differ from ours in determining whether to enforce and the manner in which to enforce such patents.\n\n  If KKC, Regeneron, the University of Pennsylvania, REGENX, or any of our future licensing partners fail to appropriately prosecute, maintain, and enforce patent protection for the patents covering any of our products or product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those products or product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, and selling competing products. In addition, even where we now have the right to control patent \n\n  52\n\n  prosecution of patents and patent applications we have licensed from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensors and their counsel that took place prior to us assuming control over patent prosecution. \n\n  If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. \n\n  We are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we may be required to make certain payments to the licensor, we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license. Additionally, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our product candidates. \n\n  In certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited to: \n\n  •the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; \n\n  •the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; \n\n  •the sublicensing of patent and other rights; \n\n  •our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; \n\n  •the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; and \n\n  •the priority of invention of patented technology. \n\n  If disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. \n\n  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, or may be subject to claims that challenge the inventorship or ownership of our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming, and result in unfavorable outcomes. \n\n  Competitors have in the past and may in the future infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. If we or one of our licensing partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our products or one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. For example, in September 2024, we filed a patent infringement suit under the Hatch-Waxman Act against Navinta, Aurobindo and Esjay. See “ – Legal Proceedings” below for more information regarding our suit. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\n\n  Interference proceedings or derivation proceedings now available under the Leahy-Smith Act provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared or instituted by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, the validity of our patents could be challenged in the USPTO by one of the new post grant proceedings (i.e., inter partes review or post grant review) now available under the Leahy-Smith Act. Our defense of litigation, interference proceedings, or post grant proceedings under the Leahy-Smith Act may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. \n\n  53\n\n  We may in the future also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents as an inventor or co-inventor. In addition, we may have ownership disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail to successfully defend against such litigation or claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. \n\n  Even if we are successful in defending against such litigation and claims, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments related to such litigation or claims. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\n\n  We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. \n\n  We employ certain individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Our efforts to vet our employees, consultants, and independent contractors and prevent their use of the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us may not be successful, and we may in the future be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management and other employees. \n\n  Changes to patent laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. \n\n  As is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing such patents is costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. \n\n  In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases, and in some instances, narrowed the scope of patent protection available. In addition, there have been recent proposals for changes to U.S. laws that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for our proprietary technologies. Depending on future actions by U.S. courts, U.S. Congress, the USPTO, and the relevant lawmaking bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents, shorten the term of our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future, or impair the validity or enforceability of our patents that may be asserted against our competitors or other third parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. \n\n  Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on our products or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Further, licensing partners such as KKC and Regeneron may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. \n\n  54\n\n  Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\n\n  Risks Related to Our Business Operations \n\n  We have limited experience as a company operating our own manufacturing facility and may experience unexpected costs or challenges.\n\n  Prior to construction of our Bedford, Massachusetts gene therapy manufacturing facility in 2023, we did not previously have experience as a company in operating our own manufacturing facility and at this point, we cannot assure that the facility will be fully utilized at all times. While our employees may be experienced in running a manufacturing facility, our limited experience as a company may contribute to unacceptable or inconsistent product quality success rates and yields, and we may be unable to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses and costs to operate the facility, which may be subject to significant impairment if our gene therapy programs are unsuccessful. Before we can begin to commercially manufacture any of our product candidates at the facility, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for our manufacturing processes and for the facility. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our processes, quality systems, methods, equipment, policies and procedures are compliant with cGMP. Until recently, few gene therapy products manufactured by a cGMP gene therapy manufacturing facility in the U.S. had received approval from the FDA; therefore, the time frame required for us to obtain such approval is uncertain. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to spend time, money and effort on production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may not be permitted to sell any products that we may develop.\n\n  As we seek to optimize and operate our manufacturing process at the facility, we will likely face technical and scientific challenges, considerable capital costs and potential difficulty in recruiting and hiring experienced, qualified personnel at the facility which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. We may also experience unexpected technical, regulatory, safety, quality or operational issues during manufacturing campaigns. As we expand our commercial footprint to multiple geographies, we may establish multiple manufacturing facilities, which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure that such additional capacity will be required or that our investment will be recouped. Further, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, lack of capacity, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, program failures, actual or threatened public health emergencies, and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy.\n\n  Our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer and to attract, retain, and motivate other qualified personnel. \n\n  We are dependent on Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., our Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Dr. Kakkis could leave our employment at any time, as he is an “at will” employee. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of the services of Dr. Kakkis or any of other member of our executive leadership team or other key employee, may impede the progress of our research, development, and commercialization objectives.\n\n  55\n\n  If we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our products, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenue will be reduced. If another party obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is essentially the same as a product we are developing for a particular indication, we may be precluded or delayed from commercializing the product in that indication. \n\n  Our business strategy focuses on the development of drugs that are eligible for FDA and EU orphan drug designation. In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. \n\n  Because the extent and scope of patent protection for our products may in some cases be limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products for which orphan drug designation may be available. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products and biologic products that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity, and our revenue will be reduced. Additionally, if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication before us, and the FDA grants such orphan drug exclusivity, we would be prohibited from obtaining approval for our product for seven or more years, unless our product can be shown to be clinically superior. \n\n  Even though we have orphan drug designation for UX111, UX143, DTX301, DTX401 and UX701 in the U.S. and Europe and for GTX 102 in the U.S., we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition or the same drug can be approved for a different indication unless there are other exclusivities such as new chemical entity exclusivity preventing such approval. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. \n\n  Our operating results would be adversely impacted if our intangible assets become impaired. \n\n  We have recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets intangible assets for in-process research and development, or IPR&D, related to DTX301 and DTX401 as a result of the accounting for our acquisition of Dimension Therapeutics. We also recorded intangible assets related to our licenses for Dojolvi and Evkeeza. We test the intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If the associated research and development effort is abandoned, the related assets will be written-off and we will record a noncash impairment loss on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We have not recorded any impairments related to our intangible assets through December 31, 2024.\n\n  We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates. \n\n  The success of our business depends upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates in addition to the continued clinical testing, potential approval, and commercialization of our existing product candidates. Research programs to identify and develop new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following: \n\n  •our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates; \n\n  •we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient technical, financial or human resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates; \n\n  56\n\n  •we may face competition in obtaining and/or developing additional product candidates; \n\n  •our product candidates may not succeed in research, discovery, preclinical or clinical testing; \n\n  •our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval; \n\n  •competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive; \n\n  •product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights; \n\n  •the market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop; \n\n  •a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost or at all; and \n\n  •a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by regulatory authorities, patients, the medical community, or payors. \n\n  If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\n\n  We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product, product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on products, product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\n  Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus our sales, marketing and research programs on certain products, product candidates or for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other products or product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product or product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\n\n  Changes to healthcare and FDA laws, regulations, and policies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\n  As described above in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation” and in the Risk Factor above entitled “ – The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain” there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs and to modify the regulation of drug and biologic products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures and regulations will be adopted in the future, including proposals to reduce the exclusivity protections provided to already approved biological products and to provide biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products an easier path to approval. Any of these measures and regulations could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our product development, testing, marketing approvals and post-market activities.\n\n  Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business and our reputation. \n\n  Our business is subject to evolving regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, privacy and security laws and regulations, and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the U.S., and in other circumstances these requirements may less stringent than those in the U.S.\n\n  57\n\n  In particular, our operations are directly, and indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations; and patient and non-patient privacy regulations, including the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, including amendments from the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, as described above in “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation”. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. For instance, one of our programs for sponsored genetic testing to help patients receive an accurate diagnosis was previously the subject of review by applicable governmental authorities of compliance with various fraud and abuse laws. We settled the matter with the governmental authorities for an immaterial settlement amount and without any admission of legal liability. We cannot assure that our other operations or programs will not be subject to review by governmental authorities or found to violate such laws.\n\n  The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process personal data of individuals, in particular with respect to special categories of personal data like health data (e.g., reliance on a legal basis, information to individuals, notification to relevant national data protection authorities in case of personal data breach and implementation of appropriate security measures). EU member states may also impose additional requirements in relation to special categories of personal data through their national legislation. In addition, the GDPR imposes specific restrictions on the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA that are not considered by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection (including the U.S.). Appropriate safeguards are required to enable such transfers (e.g., reliance on standard contractual clauses and transfer risk assessments). There are also several compliance requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and implementing regulations that create requirements relating to the privacy and security of protected health information. Those requirements are also applicable, in many instances, to business associates of covered entities. In some cases, depending on our business operations and contractual agreements, including through the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to HIPAA requirements. Also, we may be subject to additional federal, state and local privacy laws and regulations in the U.S., including new and recently enacted laws, that may apply to us and/or our service providers now or in the future and that require that we take measures to be transparent regarding, honor rights with respect to, and protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business, including personal information, particularly personal information that is not otherwise subject to HIPAA.\n\n  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any governmental sanctions, fines, or penalties are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, financial condition and our reputation could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.\n\n  Our research and development activities, including our process and analytical development activities in our quality control laboratory, and our and our third-party manufacturers’ and suppliers’ activities, including activities related to the build-out and operation of our gene therapy manufacturing facility, involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates, such as viruses, and other hazardous compounds, which subjects us to laws and regulations governing such activities. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our or our manufacturers’ facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts, and business operations or environmental damage that could result in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We cannot guarantee that the safety procedures utilized by us and our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages—and such liability could exceed our resources—and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\n\n  58\n\n  Additionally, as we and our employees increasingly use social media tools as a means of communication with the public, there is a risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause to be found in violation of applicable laws, despite our attempts to monitor such social media communications through company policies and guidelines. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our company policies or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, cause reputational harm or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.\n\n  International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S. \n\n  Our business strategy includes international expansion. We currently conduct clinical studies and regulatory activities and we also commercialize products outside of the U.S. An increasing portion of our revenues are based on our international operations, which exposes us to increased financial risks such as longer payment cycles, additional or more burdensome regulatory requirements of financial institutions outside of the U.S. and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate. We may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies, if implemented, may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. Further, we sell products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in those countries, continued weakness or additional deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. Additionally, if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products, our revenues would be adversely affected.\n\n  Doing business internationally involves a number of additional risks, including but not limited to:\n\n  •multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy and data regulations, transparency regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\n  •export and import restrictions, including the impact from new or increased sanctions and tariffs, or threats or changes in policy with respect to sanctions or tariffs, that are contemplated or could be implemented by the current Presidential administration and by other countries against the U.S. in response; \n\n  •introduction of new health authority requirements and/or changes in health authority expectations; \n\n  •failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries; \n\n  •additional potentially relevant third-party patent rights; \n\n  •complexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for, and enforcing, our intellectual property; \n\n  •difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; \n\n  •complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems; \n\n  •limits on our ability to penetrate international markets; \n\n  •natural disasters and geopolitical and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest (including, for example the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict between Israel and the surrounding areas, and the rising tensions between China and Taiwan), results of certain elections and votes, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease, inflation, recession, boycotts and resulting staffing shortages, adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, and other business restrictions; \n\n  •certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance; \n\n  •regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over commercial operations and activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions, including those under the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-corruption foreign laws and regulations; and\n\n  •regulatory and compliance risks relating to doing business with any entity that is subject to sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. \n\n  Any of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our results of operations. \n\n  59\n\n  Our employees or consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation. \n\n  We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee or consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. This could include violations of HIPAA, other U.S. federal and state law, and requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the EU Data Protection Directive. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee or consultant misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards, regulations, guidance or codes of conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\n\n  The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\n\n  The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted in the U.S. for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling or prior to regulatory approval. Further, any labeling approved by the FDA for our products or any of our product candidates may include restrictions on use, limit use to specific populations or include various other limitations. The FDA may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of any of our other product candidates as part of a REMS plan. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe such products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label provided the company did not promote such use. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. Similarly, the FDA strictly regulates the promotion of investigational products prior to approval, known as pre-approval promotion. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated and/or prosecuted several companies in relation to off-label and/or pre-approval promotion. The FDA has also requested that certain companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed, curtailed or prohibited or have delayed approval of investigational products due to pre-approval conduct. Inappropriate promotional activities may also subject a company to investigations, prosecutions and litigation by other government entities or private citizens\n\n  Our business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of computer system failures or security breaches.\n\n  Cybersecurity incidents, including phishing attacks and attempts to misappropriate or compromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise IT systems are becoming increasingly frequent and more sophisticated. Cybersecurity incidents increasingly involve the use of AI and machine learning to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks on targets. The information and data processed and stored in our technology systems, and those of our strategic partners, CROs, contract manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or other third parties for which we depend to operate our business, may be vulnerable to loss, damage, denial-of-service, unauthorized access or misappropriation. Data security breaches can occur as a result of malware, hacking, business email compromise, ransomware attacks, phishing or other cyberattacks directed by third parties. We, and certain of the third parties for which we depend on to operate our business, have experienced cybersecurity incidents, including third party unauthorized access to and misappropriation of financial information and clinical data, and may experience similar incidents in the future. Further, risks of unauthorized access and cyber-attacks have increased as most of our personnel, and the personnel of many third parties with which we do business, have adopted hybrid working arrangements. Improper or inadvertent behavior by employees, contractors and others with permitted access to our systems, including through the use of generative AI technologies, pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A system failure or security breach that interrupts our operations or the operations at one of our third-party vendors or partners could result in intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information being lost or stolen or a material disruption of our drug development programs and commercial operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, loss of trade secrets or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including protected health information, or personal information of employees or former employees, access to our clinical data, or disruption of the manufacturing process, we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed. Further, we could incur significant costs to investigate and mitigate such \n\n  60\n\n  cybersecurity incidents. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident. A security breach that results in the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information also requires us to notify individuals, governmental authorities, credit reporting agencies, or other parties, as applicable, pursuant to privacy and security laws and regulations or other obligations. Such a security breach could harm our reputation, erode confidence in our information security measures, and lead to regulatory scrutiny and result in penalties, fines, indemnification claims, litigation and potential civil or criminal liability. \n\n  We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. \n\n  Our corporate headquarters and one of our laboratories are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and our collaboration partner for Crysvita, KKC, is located in Japan, which have both in the past experienced severe earthquakes and other natural disasters. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. We have also experienced power outages as a result of wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area which are likely to continue to occur in the future. If a natural disaster, power outage, or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure (such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers) or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and may be inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n  We may acquire companies or products or engage in strategic transactions, which could divert our management’s attention and cause us to incur various costs and expenses, or result in fluctuations with respect to the value of such investment, which could impact our operating results. \n\n  We may acquire or invest in businesses or products that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, we acquired Dimension in November 2017 and GeneTx in July 2022. The pursuit of potential acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and may cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing them, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisitions or investments or be successful in completing or realizing anticipated benefits from such transactions. We may experience difficulties in assimilating the personnel, operations and products of the acquired companies, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and we may potentially lose key employees of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of acquired companies with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n  The value of our investments in other companies or businesses may also fluctuate significantly and impact our operating results quarter to quarter or year to year. We purchased 7,825,797 shares of common stock of Solid in October 2020. Our investment in Solid is being accounted for at fair value, as the fair value is readily determinable. As a result, increases or decreases in the stock price of equity investments have resulted in and will result in accompanying changes in the fair value of our investments, and cause substantial volatility in, our operating results for the reporting period. As the fair value of our investment in Solid is dependent on the stock price of Solid, which has recently seen wide fluctuations, the value of our investments and the impact on our operating results may similarly fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year such that period-to-period comparisons may not be a good indication of the future value of the investments and our future operating results.\n\n  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock \n\n  The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. \n\n  The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, including for reasons unrelated to changes in our business. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: \n\n  •adverse results or delays in preclinical or clinical studies; \n\n  •any inability to obtain additional funding; \n\n  61\n\n  •any delay in filing an IND, NDA, BLA, MAA, or other regulatory submission for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory agency’s review of that IND, NDA, BLA, MAA, or other regulatory submission; \n\n  •the perception of limited market sizes or pricing for our products and product candidates; \n\n  •decisions by our collaboration partners with respect to the indications for our products and product candidates in countries where they have the right to commercialize the products and product candidates;\n\n  •decisions by our collaboration partners regarding market access and pricing in countries where they have the right to commercialize our products and product candidates;\n\n  •failure to successfully develop and commercialize our products and product candidates; \n\n  •the level of revenue we receive from our commercialized products or from named patient sales;\n\n  •post-marketing safety issues; \n\n  •failure to maintain our existing strategic collaborations or enter into new collaborations; \n\n  •failure by us or our licensors and strategic collaboration partners to prosecute, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights; \n\n  •changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products; \n\n  •any inability to obtain adequate product supply for our products and product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices; \n\n  •adverse regulatory decisions; \n\n  •introduction of new products, services, or technologies by our competitors; \n\n  •changes in or failure to meet or exceed financial projections or other guidance we may provide to the public; \n\n  •changes in or failure to meet or exceed the financial projections or other expectations of the investment community; \n\n  •the perception of the pharmaceutical industry or our company by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community; \n\n  •the perception of the pharmaceutical industry’s approach to drug pricing;\n\n  •announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us, our strategic collaboration partners, or our competitors; \n\n  •the integration and performance of any businesses we have acquired or may acquire;\n\n  •disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; \n\n  •additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; \n\n  •significant investigations, regulatory proceedings or lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; \n\n  •securities or industry analysts’ reports regarding our stock, or their failure to issue such reports; \n\n  •changes in the market valuations of similar companies; \n\n  •general market, macroeconomic conditions or geopolitical developments, changing interest rates and inflation;\n\n  •sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and \n\n  •trading volume of our common stock. \n\n  62\n\n  In addition, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\n  Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. \n\n  We will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. \n\n  Pursuant to our 2023 Incentive Plan, as amended, or the 2023 Plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors, and consultants. At December 31, 2024, there were 6,139,766 shares available for future grants under the 2023 Plan. \n\n  Pursuant to our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, or the A&R ESPP, eligible employees can acquire shares of our common stock at a discount to the prevailing market price. At December 31, 2024, there were 6,409,256 shares available for issuance under the A&R ESPP. \n\n  Our board of directors has adopted an Employment Inducement Plan, which was amended in July 2024, or the Inducement Plan, with a maximum of 1,200,000 shares available for grant under the plan. At December 31, 2024, there were 211,628 shares available for issuance under the Inducement Plan. If our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant under the 2023 Plan, the A&R ESPP, or the Inducement Plan, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\n\n  Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. \n\n  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that: \n\n  •authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock; \n\n  •create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; \n\n  •specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors or the chairperson of our board of directors; \n\n  •prohibit stockholder action by written consent; \n\n  •establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; \n\n  •provide that our directors may be removed only for cause; \n\n  •provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors; \n\n  •expressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and \n\n  •require holders of 75% of our outstanding common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws. \n\n  These provisions, alone or together, could delay, deter, or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. \n\n  In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Further, no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors because this right is not included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n\n  63\n\n  Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. \n\n  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\n\n  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law or under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (4) any action against us asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n  General Risk Factors\n\n  If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our stock may decrease. \n\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires our independent auditors to attest to, and report on, this management assessment. Ensuring that we have adequate internal controls in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\n\n  64\n\n  We may incur additional tax liabilities related to our operations.\n\n  We have a multinational tax structure and are subject to income tax in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is influenced by many factors including changes in our operating structure, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries, our allocation of profits and losses among our subsidiaries, our intercompany transfer pricing agreements and rules relating to transfer pricing, the availability of U.S. research and development tax credits, and future changes in tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax liabilities including management’s judgment for uncertain tax positions. The Internal Revenue Service, other domestic taxing authorities, or foreign taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretation of tax laws as applied to our operations. Our reported effective tax rate and after-tax cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by tax assessments in excess of amounts accrued for our financial statements. This could materially increase our future effective tax rate thereby reducing net income and adversely impacting our results of operations for future periods.\n\n  Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \n\n  We have incurred substantial losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused taxable losses will, subject to certain limitations, carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOL carryforwards, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. An analysis to determine limitations upon our NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes for ownership changes that have occurred previously has been performed, resulting in a permanent decrease of federal and state NOL carryforwards in the amount of $7.2 million and a permanent decrease in federal research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $0.2 million. As a result of these decreases and others that may occur as a result of future ownership changes, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards and other tax attribute carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income and tax liabilities is limited and may become subject to even greater limitations, which could potentially accelerate or permanently increase future federal tax liabilities for us. In addition, there may be periods during which the use of state income tax NOL carryforwards and other state tax attribute carryforwards (such as state research tax credits) are suspended or otherwise limited, which could potentially accelerate or permanently increase future state tax liabilities for us.\n\n  Litigation may substantially increase our costs and harm our business.\n\n  We have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions, claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our directors, officers, stockholders, intellectual property, and employment matters and policies, which will cause us to incur legal fees and other costs related thereto, including potential expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of officers and directors under indemnification obligations. For example, we have been defending a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by the Estate of Henrietta Lacks alleging unjust enrichment arising from our receipt and use of HeLa cells. The expense of defending against such claims or litigation may be significant and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense. Further, the amount of time that may be required to resolve such claims or lawsuits is unpredictable, and these actions may divert management’s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in such matters that may arise from time to time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\n  Our business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to stockholder activism or hostile bids, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\n\n  Stockholder activism, which takes many forms and arises in a variety of situations, has been increasingly prevalent. Stock price declines may also increase our vulnerability to unsolicited approaches. If we become the subject of certain forms of stockholder activism, such as proxy contests or hostile bids, the attention of our management and our board of directors may be diverted from execution of our strategy. Such stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future strategy, adversely affect our relationships with business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may incur substantial costs, including significant legal fees and other expenses, related to activist stockholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\n\n  65\n\n  Increased scrutiny regarding ESG practices and disclosures, as well as existing and proposed laws related to these topics, could result in additional costs and adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\n  Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, practices and disclosures and institutional and individual investors are increasingly using ESG screening criteria in making investment decisions. Investors who are focused on ESG matters may seek enhanced ESG disclosures or to implement policies adverse to our business, and there can be no assurances that stockholders will not advocate, via proxy contests, media campaigns or other public or private means, for us to make corporate governance changes or engage in certain corporate actions. Our disclosures on these matters or a failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact employee retention and access to capital. In addition, our failure, or perceived failure, to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\n\n  Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to environmental and culture initiatives and compliance with ESG reporting standards, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the availability and cost of technologies and products that meet sustainability and ethical supply chain standards, evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, our ability to recruit, develop, and retain talent in our labor markets, and our ability to develop reporting processes and controls that comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics. As ESG best-practices, reporting standards, and disclosure requirements continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs related to maintaining or achieving our ESG goals in addition to ESG monitoring and reporting.",
