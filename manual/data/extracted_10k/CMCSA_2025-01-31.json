As part of our low-income broadband adoption program, we offer qualifying domestic customers broadband services at discounted rates through our Internet Essentials and Internet Essentials Plus services, with downstream speeds of up to 75 and 100 megabits per second, respectively. In 2024, we began offering prepaid domestic broadband services with downstream speeds of up to 200 megabits per second marketed under the NOW brand. We also offer monthly access to our network of Wi-Fi hotspots. \n\n1\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe continue to evolve and enhance our domestic network capabilities, including deploying technology in select markets that will enable us to deliver multigigabit symmetrical broadband speeds (i.e., comparable upstream and downstream speeds), as described in the Network and Technology discussion below.\n\nWe offer Xumo Stream Box (formerly Flex) devices to our domestic customers. The Xumo Stream Box provides access to and integration of streaming content and music from certain internet-based apps, including direct-to-consumer streaming services (“DTC streaming services”) such as Peacock, Disney+ and Netflix, and certain pay-per-view and video on demand programming that is available over the internet. We also offer certain bundled DTC streaming services to our broadband customers. We earn commission revenue from the sale of DTC streaming services when sold with our broadband services or through our video platforms, including X1 and Sky Q.\n\nThe map below highlights our domestic network footprint and the markets where we had 250,000 or more domestic residential broadband customers as of December 31, 2024.\n\nOur international broadband services primarily include fiber-to-the-cabinet offerings, and increasingly fiber-to-the-premises offerings. \n\nAs part of our domestic and international broadband services, we offer to customers our advanced, proprietary wireless gateways that combine an internet modem with a Wi-Fi router to deliver reliable internet speeds and enhanced coverage through an in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi network. In addition, customers may personalize and manage their Wi-Fi network and connected devices with our mobile apps and online portal. Broadband customers have access to our expanding network of secure Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nWireless\n\nWe offer wireless services for wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches (“wireless devices”) to residential customers in the United States and the United Kingdom using mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) rights. Our domestic wireless services are offered over Verizon’s wireless network and our existing network of secure residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots, and are offered initially only as part of our bundled service offerings to customers that subscribe to our qualifying broadband services.\n\nWireless customers may activate multiple lines per account. We offer domestic customers services on an unlimited data plan, on shared data plans or per gigabyte of data used. In 2024, we began offering prepaid unlimited data plans marketed under the NOW brand. We offer international customers services on various gigabyte plans or an unlimited data plan. Customers may either bring their own device or purchase devices from us with the option to pay upfront or finance the purchase interest-free over 24 months for domestic customers and over 24 to 48 months for international customers. \n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\nVideo\n\nWe offer video services to residential and business customers primarily through our X1 platform in the United States over our network, and through our Sky Q platform internationally in the United Kingdom and Italy using a combination of satellite transmission and broadband connections. X1 and Sky Q are cloud-based platforms that provide integrated search functionality leveraging set-top boxes and voice-activated remote controls. The integrated features operate across content in customers’ video service packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Xumo Stream Box. We offer a range of video packages from basic linear service to full linear service, which typically include free-to-air networks and a range of other linear television networks including premium, sports and news networks. Our international video packages also include Sky-branded entertainment television networks that offer entertainment, premium movie and free-to-air programming, as well as Sky Sports networks that are part of our Media segment. Customers may also subscribe to digital video recorder (“DVR”) services or access our video on demand services with programming that is available for no additional cost or to rent or buy digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile apps and online portals. \n\nWe also offer DTC streaming services marketed under the NOW brand, with an offering in the United States that launched in 2023. NOW services provide video content over the internet and do not require a set-top box. Our international NOW service offerings include packages for monthly access to entertainment, sports and movie programming, as well as daily pass options for sports programming. Our domestic NOW TV service is only offered to qualifying residential broadband customers and includes monthly access to a variety of linear television networks; entertainment and movie programming; integrated access to free streaming channels from Xumo Play, NBC and Sky; and access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.\n\nWe also offer video services in the United Kingdom and Italy over a broadband connection without the need for a satellite dish. These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky Glass smart televisions.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences. \n\nOther \n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) technology, and we offer residential security and automation services. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers and distribute certain of our Sky-branded entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second. \n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks. \n\n3\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nNetwork and Technology\n\nThe segments within our Connectivity & Platforms business use our HFC network in the United States, which we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities over time. This network provides the two-way transmissions required to provide connectivity services and interactive video and entertainment services through our platforms, and consists primarily of headends, fiber-optic and coaxial cables owned or leased by us, and equipment such as lasers, routers, switches and content distribution servers. Across nearly our entire domestic footprint, we leverage DOCSIS 3.1 to offer up to gigabit-plus downstream broadband speeds to residential and business customers. We also deploy fiber-to-the-premises with symmetrical speed offerings ranging up to 10 gigabits per second to residential customers who request that service, subject to local construction constraints, and up to 100 gigabits per second to business customers. We offer domestic wireless services using an MVNO agreement that allows us to offer services using Verizon’s wireless network along with our existing network of Wi-Fi hotspots across our network.\n\nWe continue to evolve and enhance our domestic network capabilities. In connection with a multiyear network transformation plan, in 2022 we began rolling out downstream speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second to our residential customers, which are now available to approximately 50% of our HFC network footprint. In 2023, we began deploying in select markets DOCSIS 4.0, which enables us to deliver multigigabit symmetrical broadband speeds over our existing HFC network. Additionally, as part of our network evolution, our engineering teams have been virtualizing and automating many core network functions using various technologies to expand capacity, increase operating efficiency, and identify and fix network issues proactively before they affect our customers. Our investment in virtualizing the network helps maintain network reliability and operational efficiency regardless of whether we connect a residence using either fiber or our HFC network. We continue to extend our network’s reach to new homes and businesses within our existing service areas, as well as edging-out to new service areas to expand the number of homes and businesses passed, and a significant portion of new homes and businesses passed are connected with fiber. We also partner with local, state and federal agencies when possible to provide services to unserved and underserved communities leveraging governmental subsidies where available. \n\nThe components of our domestic network require periodic maintenance and replacement and are primarily located on owned and leased properties, and in locations under agreements with local public utilities and municipalities. We operate national and regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide our services, and we maintain network operations centers with equipment necessary to monitor and manage the status of our services and network.\n\nOur international services are offered leveraging third-party networks, as well as our own core fiber network for broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom. The related operating plant and equipment used to provide our video and connectivity services include leased satellite system signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, and owned and leased headends and distribution networks, including coaxial, fiber-optic cables and other related equipment. For a majority of international customers, our video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission that uses satellites leased from third parties for the distribution of television networks, augmented by a set-top box and two-way broadband connectivity. We offer broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom and Italy using third-party networks. In many cases, the fee for us to access these networks is on regulated terms. The ranges of service levels and speeds we offer are dependent upon the capabilities and reach of these third-party networks. We offer wireless services in the United Kingdom using a combination of a third-party’s network and our own mobile core network.\n\nOur Connectivity & Platforms business engineering teams continue to focus on technology initiatives to develop and deploy next-generation media, content delivery, content aggregation and streaming platforms that support X1, Sky Q, NOW, Sky Stream, Sky Glass, Xumo and our cloud DVR technology. These platforms are based on our global technology platform and integrate linear television networks, owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other internet-based apps, and on demand programming into a unified experience with voice-activated remote control search and interactive features. We also continue to focus on leveraging our own cloud network services to deliver video and advanced search capabilities. Our Connectivity & Platforms business also pursues technology initiatives related to broadband and wireless services that leverage our global technology platform. We provide our customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our mobile apps and online portal, advanced security technology, and other features. \n\nProgramming\n\nTo offer video services, Residential Connectivity & Platforms licenses substantial amounts of linear television programming from third parties and from our Media segment. The fees associated with these distribution agreements are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the television network programming and a per subscriber fee, although programming expenses for certain television networks are based on a fixed fee. Additionally, certain of our agreements include the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, online portal, mobile apps, the Xumo Stream Box, and our NOW and NOW TV streaming services.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n4\n\n\nThe programming on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks includes content licensed from third parties and from our Studios segment, including certain original content. Our most significant agreements for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with Paramount, Warner Bros. and our Studios segment.\n\nOther Sources of Supply and Operations\n\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways and set-top boxes, network equipment, and services to provide our broadband and video services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless devices. We use a limited number of vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nOur technical services groups perform various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our domestic network, and servicing and upgrades of customer premise equipment. The service vehicles used by our technical services groups are primarily owned. Our customer service teams provide primarily 24/7 call-answering capability and other services, and also offer our services to residential and business customers.\n\nCompetition\n\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\n\nBroadband\n\nWe compete with a number of companies, many with significant financial resources, that offer internet services, including:\n\n•wireline telecommunications companies \n\n•wireless telecommunications companies\n\n•municipal broadband networks and power companies\n\n•satellite broadband providers\n\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies, such as AT&T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon in the United States and BT and Virgin Media O2 in the United Kingdom, have built and are continuing to build fiber-based wireline network infrastructure further into their networks, which enables them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology, and are offering services with these higher speeds in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services. \n\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. \n\nOther companies and municipalities have launched fiber-based or newer satellite-based broadband technologies that provide services in certain areas in which we operate.\n\nDomestic broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels may result in other service providers deploying subsidized internet access within our footprint. The availability of these and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our domestic broadband services.\n\nWireless\n\nWe compete with national and regional wireless service providers in the United States, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, and wireless service providers in the United Kingdom that offer wireless service on both a stand-alone basis and with other services as bundled offerings.\n\nVideo\n\nWe compete with a number of companies offering video services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including:\n\n•DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, including:\n\n◦subscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n\n◦virtual multichannel video providers, such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV, that offer streamed linear television networks\n\n◦free ad-supported television services\n\n5\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\n◦companies that offer streaming devices that access and integrate streaming content\n\n•direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) providers that transmit satellite signals to substantially all households in the Connectivity & Platforms markets to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services \n\n•companies that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide video services similar to ours and provide bundled offerings that include wireless and/or broadband services\n\n•other providers that build and operate communications systems and services in the same areas that we serve, including traditional providers of linear television programming\n\n•a broad array of other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers\n\n•other companies, such as broadcast television stations, that provide multiple free-to-air networks\n\nSimilar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, our Sky-branded entertainment television networks compete for the distribution of our television network programming to third-party video service providers and for viewers’ attention and audience share.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, as well as with television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership, difficulty in measuring fragmented audiences and the increasing number of entertainment choices available. Our advertising is sold to local, regional and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographic locations in which we operate. We also compete with companies offering technology, tools and other services to customers in the media industry.\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers. Competition for our connectivity services for small business customers is generally similar to the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. We compete for the sale of enterprise solutions offerings primarily with wide area network managed service providers, cloud-based application service providers and other telecommunication carriers.\n\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\n\nResults in our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services, including in college and vacation markets in the United States, and by the timing of the European football seasons in our international markets, which generally result in negative impacts to net customer relationship additions/(losses) in the second quarter of each year.\n\nSimilar to seasonal and cyclical variations in our Media segment, advertising revenue is subject to cyclical patterns and changes in viewership levels, driven by timing of the winter holiday season, political campaigns, sports seasons and when programming is aired.\n\nContent & Experiences Business\n\nMedia Segment\n\nWe operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business, which primarily includes:\n\n•NBCUniversal’s national and regional cable networks\n\n•NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n\n•Peacock DTC streaming service\n\n•International television networks, including Sky Sports networks in the United Kingdom and Italy\n\nWe distribute a wide variety of programming on our linear television networks and streaming services to appeal to consumers with varying preferences across demographics and geographic areas.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n6\n\n\nRevenue is primarily generated from the sale of advertising and from the distribution of our television and streaming programming.\n\nWe sell advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. Our advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell advertising across our television and streaming business.\n\nWe receive fees from the distribution of our television networks to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment, and virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. Our distribution agreements are generally multiyear, with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fixed fee. These fees include amounts for our owned television networks, including under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, as well as associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly retail or wholesale subscription fees for Peacock.\n\nWe also generate revenue from the licensing of our owned content and technology and from various digital properties. \n\nDomestic Cable Networks\n\nWe operate a diversified portfolio of cable networks operating predominantly in the United States. The table below presents a summary of NBCUniversal’s national cable networks and their advertising reach to U.S. households.\n\nCable NetworkApproximate U.S.\n\nHouseholds as of\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n(in millions)(a)\n\nDescription of Programming\n\nUSA Network66 General entertainment and sports\n\nE!65 Entertainment and pop culture\n\nSyfy65 Genre-based entertainment\n\nMSNBC65 News, political commentary and information\n\nBravo65 Lifestyle entertainment\n\nCNBC64 Business and financial news\n\nOxygen62 True crime\n\nGolf Channel54 Golf competition and golf entertainment\n\nUniversal Kids43 Children’s entertainment\n\nUniverso16 Spanish-language entertainment\n\nCNBC World 16 Global financial news\n\n(a)Household data is based on information from The Nielsen Company as of December 31, 2024 using its Cable Coverage Universe Estimates report and dynamic ad insertion estimates. The Nielsen estimates include subscribers to both traditional and certain virtual multichannel video providers. The Nielsen estimates are not based on information provided by us and are included solely to enable comparisons between our cable networks and those operated by our peers. \n\nOur regional sports networks serve approximately 11 million households across the United States, including in markets such as Boston, Philadelphia, Sacramento and San Francisco.\n\nDomestic Broadcast Networks\n\nNBC \n\nThe NBC network features original entertainment, news and sports programming that reaches viewers in virtually all U.S. television households through more than 200 affiliated stations across the United States, including our 11 owned NBC local broadcast television stations. The NBC owned local broadcast television stations include stations in 8 of the top 10 general markets and collectively reached approximately 35 million U.S. television households as of December 31, 2024, representing approximately 28% of U.S. television households. In addition to broadcasting the NBC network’s national programming, local broadcast television stations deliver local news, weather, and investigative and consumer reporting. \n\n7\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nTelemundo\n\nThe Telemundo network, a Spanish-language broadcast network, features original entertainment, news, live specials and sports programming that reaches viewers in over 96% of all U.S. Hispanic television households through 122 affiliated stations, including our 30 owned Telemundo local broadcast television stations, and our national feed. The Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations include stations in all of the top 20 U.S. Hispanic markets and collectively reached approximately 71% of U.S. Hispanic television households as of December 31, 2024. In addition to broadcasting the Telemundo network’s national programming, local broadcast television stations deliver local news, weather, and investigative and consumer reporting. We also own an independent Telemundo station serving the Puerto Rico television market.\n\nPeacock\n\nPeacock is our DTC streaming service, featuring NBCUniversal and third-party content. Programming choices include exclusive Peacock originals, current NBC, Bravo and Telemundo shows, news, late-night comedy, live sports and a library of television shows and movies, as well as several live channels. The service is available on internet-connected devices and offered through two subscription-based tiers: an ad-supported tier and a tier featuring the same content ad-free, with certain limited exceptions. The ad-free tier also allows customers to download and watch select programming offline and provides customers with a live stream of their local NBC affiliate stations. We offer Peacock in the United States directly to customers or through arrangements with third parties and our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment, which offer Peacock to customers on our behalf.\n\nInternational Networks\n\nWe operate a diversified portfolio of international television networks, including premium sports networks under the Sky Sports brand in the United Kingdom and Italy, with a majority of networks dedicated to a specific sport, such as European football. We also operate several NBCUniversal international television networks globally, including CNBC International, Studio Universal, Telemundo International and Universal TV.\n\nProgramming\n\nOur television networks and Peacock include content licensed from our Studios segment and from third parties, as well as content produced by Media segment businesses, such as live news and sports programming and certain original content, including late-night comedy for NBC and original telenovelas for Telemundo. \n\nWe have various multiyear agreements for the licensing of content, including contracts related to television and/or streaming rights for sporting events. We generally seek to include in our sports rights agreements the rights to distribute content on one or more of our television networks and on digital properties, including Peacock. \n\nOur most significant sports rights agreements relate to the NBA, NFL, Olympics and English Premier League. The table below presents a summary of these and certain other sports rights:\n\nTelevision and/or Streaming Rights\n\nMarketRights Expiration\n\nNBA and WNBA(a)\n\nUnited States, United Kingdom and Italy2035-36 NBA season and 2036 WNBA season\n\nNFL(b)\n\nUnited States2033-34 season\n\nSummer and Winter Olympic GamesUnited States2032\n\nEnglish Premier LeagueUnited Kingdom, Italy and United States\n\n2028-29, 2027-28 and 2027-28 seasons, respectively\n\nPGA Tour and other golf eventsUnited StatesBetween 2026 and 2031\n\nNASCAR(c)\n\nUnited States2031\n\nBig Ten football and basketballUnited States2029-30 season\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (“WWE”)\n\nUnited States2029 on television and 2026 on Peacock\n\nFormula OneUnited Kingdom and Italy2029 and 2027, respectively\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket BoardUnited Kingdom2028\n\nEnglish Football LeagueUnited Kingdom2028-29 season\n\nSerie AItaly2028-29 season\n\nFIFA World Cup (Spanish-language)United States2026\n\nCertain professional sports teams through our Regional Sports NetworksCertain regions in the United StatesBetween 2027 and 2040\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n8\n\n\n(a) Beginning with the 2025-26 NBA season and 2026 WNBA season, includes the rights to produce and distribute across our networks and on Peacock a specified number of NBA and WNBA regular season and playoff games, the NBA All-Star game and NBA All-Star Saturday Night each season, as well as six NBA Conference Finals series and three WNBA Finals series over the term of the agreements. A certain number of NBA games will also be distributed in the Spanish language on Telemundo.\n\n(b) Includes the rights to produce and distribute on NBC and on Peacock a specified number of regular season games that includes Sunday Night Football games, Thursday Kickoff games and Thanksgiving night games, playoff games, and three remaining Super Bowl games, the next of which is in February 2026. The agreement expires after the 2033-34 season, with a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. The agreement also includes rights to additional exclusive games on Peacock. All of the NFL games are also distributed in the Spanish language on Universo or Telemundo.\n\n(c) Includes the unilateral right by the other party (i.e., the licensor) to the agreement, under certain circumstances, to shorten the term of the agreement by one year.\n\nOur television and streaming business competes for the acquisition of content, including sports rights, and for on-air and creative talent primarily with other television networks, DTC streaming providers, and local broadcast television stations. In Europe, major sports rights, which are significant to our international networks, are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a 3 to 5 year period.\n\nStudios Segment\n\nOur Studios segment primarily includes our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Our studio production facilities primarily include our owned Universal City location in Los Angeles, California and our leased studios in Atlanta, Georgia and in Elstree, United Kingdom. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. We also generate revenue from the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties.\n\nFilm Studios\n\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n\n•Universal Pictures\n\n•Illumination\n\n•DreamWorks Animation\n\n•Focus Features\n\n•Working Title\n\nWe distribute the majority of our films initially for exhibition in movie theaters, while other films are initially distributed through licensing agreements. After their initial release, we distribute films globally to different customers over multiple licensing windows. We license films, including recent films and selections from our film library, which is comprised of more than 6,500 movies in a variety of genres, to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers. This includes licenses to our Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Certain films are also licensed to our Media segment and made available for viewing on Peacock on the same date as the theatrical release. We also distribute films globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. Additionally, we acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Theatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sales retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows and through physical and digital home entertainment product sales.\n\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies. In certain cases, we have also entered into film co-financing arrangements with third party studios and non-studio entities to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\n\nIn connection with film studio productions, we typically owe “residuals” payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue. We also typically owe “participations” payments to creative talent, to third parties under co-financing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\n\n9\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nTelevision Studios\n\nOur television studios develop, produce and distribute original content, including scripted and unscripted television series. We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n•Universal Television \n\n•Universal Content Productions\n\n•Universal Television Alternative Studio\n\n•Universal International Studios\n\n•Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content’s financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions. \n\nTheme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n•Universal Orlando Resort: Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, Volcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features on-site themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n\n•Universal Studios Hollywood: Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex. \n\n•Universal Studios Japan: Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan. \n\n•Universal Beijing Resort: Includes the Universal Studios Beijing theme park, as well as Universal CityWalk Beijing, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and experiences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025. \n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities. \n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements. \n\nCompetition\n\nMedia\n\nOur Media segment competes for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including DTC streaming service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information. \n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n10\n\n\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content, as well as with other television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\n\nStudios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\n\nTheme Parks\n\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed attractions. There is increased competition in areas with high concentrations of theme parks and other attractions operated by several companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\n\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\n\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. International advertising revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s exhibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\n\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n\n11\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nCorporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests reported in Corporate and Other consist primarily of our Sky-branded video services and television networks in Germany, Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications formed in June 2022. Xumo is focused on developing and offering a streaming platform on a variety of devices, including Xumo TV smart televisions, which have an operating system that leverages our global technology platform, and also operates the Xumo Play streaming service.\n\nLegislation and Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. In the United States in particular, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), and Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations affect significant aspects of our communications businesses.\n\nBeyond the more significant regulations summarized below, legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. Applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming services and artificial intelligence (“AI”), may also affect our business. These legislators and regulators, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. \n\nLegislative and regulatory activity has increased in recent years, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace. Federal agencies have considered adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband, although it is uncertain whether those initiatives will continue under the new Administration. States and localities are increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Regulators in various international jurisdictions are similarly considering changes to telecommunications and media requirements. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. \n\nThe following paragraphs summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirements and risks affecting our businesses. \n\nCommunications-Related Regulations in the United States\n\nBroadband\n\nOur broadband services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments.\n\nIn 2023, the FCC adopted broad rules that prohibit digital discrimination of access to broadband service based on income level, race, ethnicity, color, religion and national origin; this order currently is subject to legal challenge in federal court. In 2024, the FCC reclassified broadband internet access services as a “telecommunications service” subject to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. However, a federal appellate court in January 2025 overturned that reclassification, ruling that broadband internet access service is an “information service” under Title I of the Communications Act and that the FCC does not have authority to subject broadband services to utility-style regulations such as rate regulation and market entry and exit requirements under Title II. As a Title I “information service,” broadband is only subject to light-touch regulation such as broadband disclosure requirements, and deployment, subscription, and pricing reporting requirements. States and localities have in the past enacted and may in the future periodically consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and broadband affordability, which could create a patchwork of, and potentially inconsistent, federal, state and local regulatory regimes. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses, and we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation or how any rules will ultimately be interpreted and enforced and how they might affect our business.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n12\n\n\nWe, from time to time, participate in broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels and may also become subject to additional broadband-related commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding. We cannot predict how and to whom any such funds will be awarded, when the initiatives will be terminated or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\n\nA number of municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government-owned networks, particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks. Other states, however, have amended or may amend such laws to facilitate such networks. Much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government-owned networks, although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved and underserved areas and locations. We cannot predict how successful any of those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\n\nVideo and Media\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that apply to the cable services we provide through our Residential Connectivity & Platforms business and to our cable networks and local broadcast television stations in our Media business. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against DTC streaming service providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\n\nFederal, state and local franchising rules and regulations may require us to provide adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming; comply with certain renewal procedures for our franchise agreements; pay franchise fees; and comply with customer service, accessibility, and certain other requirements. In addition, the FCC and other federal agencies can impact the programming networks that we carry, as well as how we price, package, bill and market our video services. FCC regulations also require cable operators to carry programming transmitted by certain local broadcast television stations (“must-carry” requirement) or to negotiate a “retransmission consent” agreement with certain other stations that will frequently involve payments from cable operators to the station; govern program access by preventing cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers; grant licenses to broadcast television stations for 8-year cycles, which may not be renewed on favorable terms, or at all; limit local and national television ownership, as well as foreign ownership in a broadcast television station; and regulate children’s programming. \n\nThe FCC enforces these rules on a case-by-case basis based on complaints filed by consumers, state and local governments, and other entities. We have been involved in disputes at the FCC in some of these areas and may be involved in new disputes in the future, including potential disputes related to content moderation and free speech. We cannot predict the outcome of any such disputes or associated litigation. The FCC and Congress have previously considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in “tiers”) and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\n\nFurthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws to impose franchise or other fees on DTC streaming services. To date, courts have invalidated those laws, but we cannot predict the outcome of any future litigation.\n\nWireless\n\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service primarily using our MVNO rights to provide the service over Verizon’s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers, such as E911 services and local number portability, as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\n\nVoice\n\nWe provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, rural call completion, customer equipment back-up power, robocall mitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\n\n13\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nSpectrum Allocations\n\nThe FCC, the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other federal agencies have taken, and in some cases are preparing to take, steps to evaluate and potentially modify certain spectrum allocations and rules to make available additional spectrum that likely will be used for licensed and/or unlicensed commercial services, including 5G and Wi-Fi services, which could impact our businesses. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these spectrum allocation actions. Additional commercial spectrum could impact current marketplace dynamics, including the ability of wireless providers to compete with our services. Further, if the FCC reallocates spectrum that our businesses currently use to provide services, we could be required to transition our operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\n\nInternational Communications-Related and Other Regulations\n\nCertain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation, including those related to broadband and voice services and television networks, in Europe, Latin America, and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection, and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.\n\nOther Areas of Regulation\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs/Blu-rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals’ personal information. In the United States, federal privacy laws and regulations, such as those found within the Communications Act or the Video Privacy Protection Act, restrict companies’ collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. The proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers’ rights to include individual rights of access, deletion, portability, correction, the right to appeal, and the individual’s right to “opt in” to collection and use of certain types of “sensitive” personal information. Internationally, many of the laws that apply to our businesses are similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act of 2018, which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n14\n\n\nSome of our businesses are also subject to the FTC’s general oversight of consumer privacy protections through its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices, as well as through its enforcement authority over the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The FTC has sought to expand its authority in this area through various rulemakings related to general privacy, targeted advertising and children’s privacy. There has been an increased focus on children’s privacy at both the state and federal levels within the United States, as well as internationally. These new laws may require changes to our products and services and could adversely affect our advertising businesses.\n\nIn addition, many international data protection laws, some federal laws, and all 50 U.S. states have security breach notification requirements that obligate businesses to provide notice to consumers and government agencies if certain information has been accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party; some of these laws also require documented information security programs. \n\nState and Local Taxes\n\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, our businesses, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our businesses, most notably new taxes or fees on digital advertising or other digital commerce. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state and local tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (“ITFA”) prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges and discriminating against electronic commerce; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA or other federal laws. \n\nOther Regulations\n\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities, actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Studios and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, regulatory fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, political broadcasting, sponsorship identification, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related practices, environmental-related matters, our equipment supply chain, and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming, and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in fines, sanctions and/or ongoing compliance plans and government oversight. \n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 182,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Approximately 30% of our employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, East Asia and South Asia. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized, although many of Content & Experiences’ freelance and temporary writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements or work councils. Outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\n\nOur company has been built on a foundation of respect, integrity and trust, and we are committed to creating and fostering a work environment that promotes those values. As a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees, and media talent and production employees. Some of our key workforce-related programs and initiatives include the following.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\n•We seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys, as well as through employee resource groups.\n\n15\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\n•We are committed to creating an environment that encourages employees to ask questions, raise concerns and speak up about a workplace issue or suspected illegal or unethical conduct. We provide several channels for speaking up without fear of retaliation, including a helpline and a web portal that are administered by an independent third-party company and allow for anonymous reporting when permitted by applicable laws.\n\nTalent Development\n\n•We provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with in-classroom and online trainings and on-the-job experience.\n\n•We offer education tuition assistance to full-time employees in the United States.\n\n•Our Board of Directors discusses succession planning for our CEO and the remainder of our senior executive management team at least once a year. Throughout the year, our senior executive management team, as well as a broader array of executives throughout our businesses, make presentations to the Board and its committees and interact with our directors informally outside of regularly scheduled Board meetings, which provides directors with meaningful insight into our current pool of talent, what attracts and retains our executives, and our company culture.\n\n•We promote a culture that embraces equal opportunity for all.\n\n•Comcast has nine voluntary employee resource groups with more than 36,000 members in 240 chapters across the U.S. These employee-led organizations are open to all and contribute to business priorities, career development, and foster an inclusive and collaborative workplace.\n\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\n\n•We offer a robust portfolio of health and welfare programs and solutions designed to meet the unique needs of our employees and their families, delivered through a consistent and seamless member experience.\n\n•Our offerings include comprehensive and affordable health care coverage options along with a variety of additional tools and resources, including access to dedicated health care navigators, expert medical opinion services, virtual primary care services and a diabetes management program. In addition, we offer comprehensive family planning options, including for adoption and surrogacy, and provide specialized support teams to help employees manage all stages in the family planning journey including parenthood.\n\n•We continue to invest in the emotional wellbeing of our employees and offer a broad array of tools and resources such as our Employee Assistance Program, which provides personal counseling sessions to support employees and their families and provide problem-solving support for a broad range of issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and more. We also offer various digital emotional wellbeing tools, including child learning and behavior support, meditation, stress management, sleep issues, depression, chronic pain and substance use.\n\nFinancial Benefits\n\n•We focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market, taking into account the job position’s location and responsibilities. \n\n•We provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan in the United States with a company match and other retirement arrangements internationally.\n\n•We have employee stock purchase plans in the United States, United Kingdom, India and several other European countries where most of our full-time and part-time employees can purchase our stock at a discount. \n\n•We generally grant stock-based awards on an annual basis to a meaningful portion of our employees, with over 24,000 employees receiving such awards in 2024. \n\n•We offer financial literacy training and counseling to support employees in making their own financial decisions.\n\nAvailable Information and Websites\n\nOur phone number is (215) 286-1700, and our principal executive offices are located at One Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.comcastcorporation.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC. The information posted on our websites is not incorporated into our SEC filings. \n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n16\n\n\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in “Risk Factors” and in other reports we file with the SEC.\n\nAny of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n17\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A: Risk Factors\n\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\n\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\n\nOur businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments. We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nBelow is a summary of our most significant sources of competition. Many of these competitors offer competitive pricing, packaging and/or bundling of services to customers, which further increases competition. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section.\n\n•Connectivity & Platforms’ broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services); electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks; and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see “—We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses” below and Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.\n\n•Our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers.\n\n•Competition for video services consists primarily of DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, DBS providers and telecommunications companies.\n\n•Business Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers.\n\n•Our businesses in Content & Experiences, as well as our video business, face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment, including from social networking and user-generated content, as well as tourism, recreational activities and lodging. They must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming), advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has further intensified as certain DTC streaming service providers have commissioned, and may continue to commission, high-cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs.\n\nCompetitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms. Some of these competitors could also have preferential access to customer data or other competitive information. Further, consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer a range of products and services, including aggregating certain content into a stand-alone offering, offering free or lower cost DTC streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for broadband and wireless services or bundling DTC streaming services on their platforms. \n\nOur competitive position may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. In addition, our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. For example, some of these constituencies may have their own, and some have conflicting, environmental, social and governance priorities, which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment.\n\nChanges in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content continue to challenge existing business models, increase the number of competitors that our businesses face, and have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much or for how long they pay for such content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms, and gaming and virtual reality products and services, continue to increase, intensify audience fragmentation and disaggregate how content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to consumers, rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels also disrupts traditional media distribution business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks’ results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\nA decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. Because we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of our linear television networks have experienced, and likely will continue to experience, as well as the level of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. \n\nOur success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses. \n\n19\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nWe also create content for licensing to third parties and to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to license such content on acceptable terms or at all could negatively impact our business. Moreover, we may generate lower revenue when we opt to retain our content for our own use, including for Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties who pay licensing fees for such content.\n\nIf our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses.\n\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our Residential Connectivity & Platforms business and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. Part of these programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to offset programming cost increases through rate increases, the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nMoreover, as our contracts with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nThe loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nOur linear television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. The number of subscribers to our television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers as the media distribution business model changes. Similarly, multichannel video providers may elect not to enter into agreements to distribute some or all of our linear television networks as a result of these changing market dynamics. In addition, our broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. Our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either “must-carry” status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without paying any compensation to us, or “retransmission consent,” in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider.\n\nFor all of these types of arrangements, our ability to renew agreements on acceptable terms may be affected by evolving market dynamics and industry consolidation. There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on similar terms. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nOur businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.\n\nWe rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. We may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our businesses. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain, or continue to obtain, licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, or at all, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n20\n\n\nIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of our businesses, and our success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content we create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. The legal landscape for new technologies, including AI, remains uncertain, and legal developments could impact our ability to protect against unauthorized third-party use, misappropriation, reproduction or infringement or impact our ability to deploy new technologies. Our use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may also increase our exposure to intellectual property claims.\n\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for our businesses. For example, certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation, and sporting events on our international networks may be illegally transmitted. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\n\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\n\nWe depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. We also rely on third-party satellite transponder capacity to provide video services in Europe, as well as on third-party wireless networks to offer certain wireless services in the United States and internationally. Some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, including as a result of cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents, faulty software updates, or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\n\nOur businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\n\nOur success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology, including AI, and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, how we create our entertainment products, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies (including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services) continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies and create further competition for our businesses. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds, and some providers offer newer satellite broadband services. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. \n\nIf we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers or that enhance our business operations, such as through the use of AI, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speeds by leveraging our DOCSIS 4.0 technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platforms. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. We also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors’ product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\n\n21\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by unauthorized parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hacking, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, malicious social engineering, theft, misconduct, fraud and other malicious activities. Incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns, human error, software or hardware failures or vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\n\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. For example, we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques, such as AI, that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors’ systems and other technologies. We also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, that in many cases is provided or made available to third-party vendors who agree to protect it, which has in the past, and may in the future, become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks with respect to such third-party suppliers and service providers and their products and services. Due to applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity breaches or incidents experienced by such third parties in relation to the information we share with them. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our third-party vendors, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\n\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused, and may from time to time in the future cause, a variety of business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise or exfiltration of sensitive, personal, proprietary, confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data, and reputational impacts. In addition, despite efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, attacks can persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and following detection, it may take considerable time to understand the nature, scope, impact and timing of the incident. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. Repercussions of these incidents, some of which we have experienced in the past, could include litigation or cause regulators to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations. Refer to Item 1C: Cybersecurity for additional information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n22\n\n\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States, in Europe or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers’ discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\nAcquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as the proposed Spin-off. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\n23\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nNatural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nOur services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers’ or vendors’ equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and regulatory fines or remedial measures, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others.\n\nThe amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\n\nThe loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses. \n\nIn addition, our Content & Experiences business depends on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\nLabor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\n\nMany of the writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees in our Content & Experiences business, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Many of these collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. For example, the Writers Guild of America (“Writers Guild”) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG”) work stoppages in 2023 paused productions, which reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages in the future.\n\nIn addition, labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance Matters\n\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\n\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and federal laws and regulations. In the United States in particular, the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations affect significant aspects of our communications businesses. \n\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. Applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming services and AI, may also affect our business. These legislators and regulators, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. \n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n24\n\n\nLegislative and regulatory activity has increased in recent years, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may from time to time consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace. Federal agencies have considered adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband, although it is uncertain whether those initiatives will continue under the new Administration. States and localities are increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Regulators in various international jurisdictions are similarly considering changes to telecommunications and media requirements. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs. \n\nIn addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.\n\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Legislation and Regulation” discussion within that section.\n\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\n\nWe are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. Greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. We also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOur Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock.\n\nOur Class B common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. This non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of Class B common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of AT&T Corp.’s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. Stock dividends payable on the Class B common stock in the form of Class B or Class A common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our Board of Directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. These potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of Class B common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into Class B common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our Class B common stock. Brian L. Roberts, our chairman and CEO, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the Class B common stock, which could be at a premium.",
