      "text": "Item 1. Business\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n    Quest Diagnostics works across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time.  We provide diagnostic insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world.\n\n    The patients we serve annually comprise approximately one-third of the adult population of the United States, and over a three-year period, we serve approximately one-half of the adult population of the United States.  We estimate that annually we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the United States.  \n\nThe Quest Way\n\n    We operate our business and achieve our goals according to a clear set of principles we call “The Quest Way,” which consists of the following:\n\n•Our Purpose, or why we exist, is to work together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. \n\n•Our Strategy, or how we grow, is to provide solutions that serve the evolving needs of our customers, based on our high quality, innovative, convenient and affordable services.  \n\n•Our Culture, or how we work, is powered by what we call the “5Cs”: customer first, collaboration, care, continuous improvement, and curiosity.  \n\n    We play a critical role in healthcare decisions for customers across the healthcare ecosystem, including physicians, hospitals, patients and consumers, health plans, government agencies, employers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies and insurers.  We believe The Quest Way is aligned with the triple aim of healthcare of improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the overall cost of care.\n\n    We believe our employees are critical to our success, and we continually strive to create an environment that allows them to contribute to our goal of creating a healthier world.  We are focused on delivering services that help improve the physician and healthcare provider experience to enable us and them to deliver high quality, effective and affordable care to patients.  We provide a number of innovative ways for patients to access services from us, including consumer-initiated services offered through QuestHealth.com, which provides a high quality, self-directed option with physician oversight for individuals to gain insights into their health.  \n\n    During 2024, we generated net revenues of $9.9 billion.  Additional financial information concerning Quest Diagnostics for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is included in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.\n\n    Quest Diagnostics was incorporated in Delaware in 1990; its predecessor companies date back to 1967.  We conduct business through our headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey, and our laboratories, patient service centers, offices and other facilities around the United States and in selected locations outside the United States.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Quest Diagnostics,” “Quest,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” mean Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nOUR STRATEGY \n\n    Our strategy aims to achieve two key goals: generate growth and optimize our operating efficiency.  Our growth strategy focuses on continually developing solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers.  We help people make the best decisions to improve health by providing high quality, innovative, convenient and affordable diagnostic testing insights and services using our scale and extensive reach.  We drive growth by: \n\n•offering an industry-leading menu of testing and other services;\n\n•collaborating with healthcare providers and partners to leverage our broad access;\n\n•leveraging our data assets and services to improve population health and enable value-based care; and\n\n•continuously improving our quality and efficiency by leveraging the Quest Management System and by embracing innovative technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (\"AI\").\n\n    Our growth strategy is focused on our primary customer channels – physicians, hospitals, patients and consumers – supported by Advanced Diagnostics™ (defined below), strategic acquisitions, and continuous quality improvement. \n\nPhysicians\n\n    We serve approximately half the physicians in the United States each year.  We serve virtually all types of physicians from primary care physicians and internists to specialists, including rheumatologists, cardiologists, neurologists, and obstetricians/gynecologists.  We also serve physicians associated with accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), and Federally Qualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”).  Physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors, but we believe that we provide the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, deep medical and scientific expertise, high quality, leading access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information-technology solutions.\n\nHospitals\n\n    We believe that the growing market challenges faced by hospitals, including continued consolidation, price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, evolving healthcare payment models, capital needs, changing technology and limited resources, provide us with an opportunity to partner with them as they consider more effective ways to implement their laboratory testing strategy and drive demand for our expertise and services. \n\n    We serve approximately half the hospitals in the United States each year in many ways, including:\n\n•Serving as a hospital lab’s laboratory.  In 2024, we generated over $1 billion in revenue from “reference testing,” where we perform testing that hospitals do not perform in their own in-hospital labs. \n\n•Helping hospitals operate their labs more efficiently.  In 2024, our Professional Laboratory Services offering generated approximately $800 million in revenues and management fees supporting hospitals in the operation of their own labs.  Our key Professional Laboratory Services offerings include lab management outsourcing, test menu optimization and spend consolidation, supply chain management and providing, advanced data solutions.\n\n•Acquiring outreach lab operations from hospitals.  Quest looks for opportunities to acquire assets of outreach lab operations from hospitals whose in-house labs have expanded from supporting in-patients to supporting out-patients and ambulatory patients who see physicians that may or may not be employed or otherwise affiliated with the hospitals.  \n\n    We also have joint venture arrangements with leading hospitals and health systems.  These joint venture arrangements, which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated clinicians and other local healthcare providers, serve as our principal facilities in their service areas.  Typically, we have either a majority ownership interest in, or day-to-day management responsibilities for, our joint venture relationships. \n\nPatients and Consumers\n\n    We have taken steps to be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of choice of diagnostic information services.  Patients increasingly expect their healthcare experiences to be consumer-centric, which includes being more transparent, accessible and convenient.  Most patients have a choice when selecting a diagnostic testing provider, and our goal is to provide leading services in conveniently located patient service centers that can provide a comprehensive suite of testing services.  Many of our 2,400 patient service centers are located inside large retail stores or in convenient retail settings.  We continue to enhance our operations to improve the patient experience in these locations.  For example, our \"Schedule at Check In\" capability encourages patients to make appointments, and our self-serve kiosks provide wait-time estimates for walk-in and standby patients and offer many language options.  These improvements allow us to better manage demand and productivity and have reduced average wait times in the patient service centers.  We also provide mobile phlebotomy services in many parts of the United States so patients who prefer an in-home blood draw may access our services for a fee. \n\n    We work to improve our digital experience, from making it easier for patients and consumers to locate a patient service center and receive results on our MyQuest® patient healthcare portal to enabling providers to access their patients’ test result reports.  We are also integrating the patient payment process into the digital customer experience, which improves the patient experience, provides greater pricing transparency, helps our patient concession rate and reduces demands on phlebotomists.  \n\n    As people are increasingly seeking to be more directly involved in and have more control over their health outcomes, we are seeking to meet this need. Our QuestHealth.com platform empowers health-minded consumers to purchase testing directly from us without first having to visit their doctor.  Consumers who want to evaluate their health or monitor certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes or hepatitis, as well as those seeking privacy can use these self-directed options to identify and more frequently monitor health issues than their health plan or other payer may be willing to reimburse.  We are enabling a third-party physician to review and place test orders and be available to consult with the consumer via a teleconsult about their test results.  We also launched health coaching on our QuestHealth.com platform.  Our QuestHealth™ offering reflects our belief that by building on the foundation of our strong consumer focus we can capture the growing opportunities presented by the growth of consumer-initiated testing and demand for expanded access to basic healthcare services.     \n\n    In 2024, we launched a new service that offers patients experiencing symptoms of several common genital tract infections the option to self-collect a swab specimen, aimed at increasing privacy, convenience and speed of testing.  We also provide opportunities for companies with telehealth and retail business models to rebrand our testing and utilize our patient service centers to provide access.   \n\nOther Customer Channels\n\n    Our other customer channels include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories, which are described in more detail under “ – Customer Channels”.  While we principally focus on the U.S. market, we serve customers globally and have a growing business that provides advanced reference testing to laboratory providers in other countries.  For more information about our operations, see “ – Business Operations”.\n\nAdvanced Diagnostics\n\n    We support the needs of all our customers with a focus on Advanced Diagnostics™.  Clinical laboratory testing can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced.  Non-routine tests are tests that may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated data analysis, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.  Some non-routine tests are advanced (“Advanced Diagnostics™”).  Advanced Diagnostics™ includes certain procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing. \n\n    We are a leading provider of Advanced Diagnostics™ and provide an array of offerings across the spectrum, including in high growth areas such as Molecular Genomics and Oncology.  We have a portfolio of oncology tests that includes traditional oncology screening and anatomic pathology, such as cervical cancer and skin cancer screening and diagnosis.  We \n\n3 \n\n\nare also well positioned to take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing to grow our business in cancer and other disease state testing.  This includes inherited genetics, newborn screening, and rare disease diagnosis, and solid tumor sequencing, such as to aid treatment selection and monitoring.  \n\n    Our investments in our Advanced Diagnostics™ offerings enhance our innovation capabilities and strengthen our service offering, making our Advanced Diagnostics™ offerings more attractive and accessible to physicians and hospitals.  We are also seeking to apply the capabilities gained by these efforts to support other areas where we can make a meaningful difference in healthcare, including offerings to pharmaceutical companies and consumers.\n\n    We are also particularly focused on the rapidly growing areas of monitoring recurrence and therapy effectiveness.  In 2023, we acquired Haystack Oncology, Inc. (\"Haystack Oncology\") a cancer testing company that has developed a highly sensitive testing technology for detecting minimal-residual disease (“MRD”) by circulating tumor DNA due to residual or recurring cancer.  Circulating tumor DNA (\"ctDNA\") refers to DNA fragments shed by a solid tumor, such as colorectal or breast cancer, into the blood stream.  We believe this acquisition strengthens our comprehensive oncology portfolio by positioning us well to compete in the higher-growth clinical area of ctDNA solid-tumor MRD testing.  Since the acquisition, several organizations have used the Haystack Oncology MRD test in research, including for clinical trials. During 2024, we also developed the test as a clinical offering in anticipation of making it available to oncologists.  In 2023, we also launched our QUEST AD-DETECT® test portfolio for assessing Alzheimer's disease risk using blood specimens, as opposed to testing by more costly or invasive methods, such as testing of cerebral spinal fluid by lumbar puncture.  We continue to add new testing to this suite of services for assessing the risk of Alzheimer's Disease, including isoform and plasma testing for patients with cognitive impairment.  In addition, our Autoimmune ANAlyzeR™ service helps primary care physicians comprehensively screen for autoimmune disorders to accelerate diagnosis and care by specialists.        \n\nAcquisitions and Capital Deployment\n\n    Our strategy includes generating growth through value-creating, strategically aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria.  We screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, return on invested capital and impact on our earnings.  We endeavor to grow revenues each year by 1-2% through acquisitions.  We will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner, including focusing on enhancing our solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities.  During 2024, we completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 billion.  We acquired select assets of the outreach laboratory services business of Allina Health, which serves providers and patients in Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as select assets of the outreach laboratory services business of OhioHealth and the outreach laboratory services business of University Hospitals, which each serve providers and patients in Ohio.  \n\n    In August 2024, we also acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of LifeLabs Inc. and all of the partnership interests of BPC Lab Finance LP (collectively, \"LifeLabs\"), which provides laboratory diagnostic information and digital health connectivity systems in Canada.  During the full year of 2024, LifeLabs performed approximately 140 million laboratory tests to help diagnose, treat, monitor and prevent diseases for millions of Canadians.  LifeLabs operates approximately 15 laboratories, over 350 collection centers in British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan, and an extensive network of couriers and mobile phlebotomists.  LifeLabs also partners with governments and companies to develop technologies and customized services.\n\n    Our significant acquisitions in each of the last three years are further discussed in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).\n\n    Acquisitions are part of our disciplined capital deployment framework, which also includes investment in our business, dividends and share repurchases and is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating.  We expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Consistent with that expectation, in January 2025, we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend by approximately 6.7%, from $0.75 per common share to $0.80 per common share.  This represents our 14th increase in the dividend since the beginning of 2012.  For many years, we have maintained a common stock repurchase program.  Since the beginning of 2012, we have returned approximately $7.7 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock.\n\n4 \n\n\nOUR STRENGTHS\n\nContinuous Quality Improvement\n\n    Our goal is to provide every patient and customer with services and products of superior quality.  We strive to accomplish that through rigorous processes that we measure and seek to improve, and by using the Quest Management System, which provides best-in-class business performance tools to create and implement effective and sustainable quality processes.  Our Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements.  The Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to deliver superior quality care, identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems.  To help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we have implemented our Quality System Framework, which serves as a reference guide for our employees and describes our Quality System Elements to provide the structure for each laboratory to achieve and maintain quality processes.  We also have a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to help us ensure we have a high-quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network.\n\nOperating Efficiency\n\n    We strive to enhance operational excellence and improve our efficiency across our value chain and operations, from the time that we first interact with a potential customer until the time we receive payment for our services.  Improving our operations through standardization, optimization, digitization and automation can yield many benefits, including improving our quality and competitiveness, strengthening our foundation for growth, supporting our growth strategy, and increasing employee engagement, customer service and shareholder value.  We are guided by a service dashboard that focuses throughout our operations on quality for consumers, healthcare providers and employees, including medical quality, on-time delivery, competitive costs and employee safety. \n\n    Our cost excellence program, Invigorate, includes structured plans to drive savings and improve productivity across the value chain, including in such areas as patient services, logistics and laboratory operations, revenue services, information technology (\"IT\") and procurement.  Our Invigorate program has consistently delivered 3% of annual cost savings and productivity improvements, which partly offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases, and reimbursement pressures.  We are leveraging automation and AI to improve productivity and improve quality across our entire value chain, not just in the laboratory.  For example, in 2024, we advanced our use of automation in front-end specimen processing to include five of our labs, freeing more of our processors to focus on higher-order work.  Other areas of focus include reducing denials and patient concessions, enhancing the digital experience, and selecting and retaining talent. \n\nOrganized to Drive Growth and Value\n\n    We strive to strengthen our organizational capabilities to align around growth opportunities, coordinate business units for seamless execution and leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency.  The value creation side of our business includes product and commercial marketing and is organized by clinical franchise and focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace, including new test development and diagnostic insights.  Our clinical franchises – Cardiometabolic, Endocrine, and Wellness, Drug Monitoring and Toxicology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Molecular Genomics and Oncology, Neurology, and Women’s and Reproductive Health – enable us to operate like a boutique laboratory while maintaining our scale advantages, and work with our research and development and commercial organizations to identify and deliver new and improved solutions.  The value delivery side includes sales, laboratory operations, field operations, logistics and client services.\n\nAssets and Capabilities that Deliver Value  \n\n    We collaborate with partners and customers across the healthcare ecosystem to help create a healthier world.

Since its inception, we have committed approximately $46 million to more than 80 programs launched across the United States and Puerto Rico, including supporting community workforce development, COVID-19 testing and vaccination events, wellness events, educating young students on healthy nutrition choices and expanding research and mentorship opportunities.  Numerous undertakings demonstrate our commitment to FQHCs and the people they serve, including by providing free lab testing services.  We are also looking at ways we can assist in addressing social determinants of health that can create barriers to healthcare for marginalized communities in the healthcare system.\n\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n    The Company is made up of two businesses:  Diagnostic Information Services and Diagnostic Solutions.  Our Diagnostic Information Services business develops and delivers diagnostic information services, providing insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes.  Our Diagnostic Solutions group includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare IT businesses, which offers solutions for healthcare providers and payers.  Our services primarily are provided under the Quest Diagnostics brand, but we also provide services under other brands, including AmeriPath,® Dermpath Diagnostics,® ExamOne,® and Quanum.® \n\n    We are a leading provider of diagnostic information services in the United States, where we conduct substantially all of our business.  We see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic information services to markets outside the United States, including leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets.  In August 2024, we acquired LifeLabs, which provides laboratory diagnostic information and digital health connectivity systems in Canada.  \n\n8 \n\n\nDiagnostic Information Services    \n\n    Background - clinical testing.   Clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinical testing is used for predisposition, screening, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services.   \n\n    Clinical laboratory testing, which can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced, generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens, such as microbiology samples.  Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine.  Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs.  Commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts.  Non-routine tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated data analysis, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.  It may not be practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for many hospitals, ACOs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of non-routine tests or to perform low-volume non-routine testing in-house.  Such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory that can perform these non-routine tests.  Some non-routine tests are Advanced Diagnostics™, which includes certain procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing. \n\n    Anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients. \n\n    Our services.  We provide information and insights based on an industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We have strong testing capabilities, including services for the predisposition, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers and other diseases, and offer advanced tests in many fields, including endocrinology, immunology, neurology and oncology.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing solutions and insights to our customers, based on the testing that we perform, the data that we gather and our extensive medical, information and connectivity assets.  We believe that offering services, solutions and insights based on a full range of tests, information assets and other capabilities strengthens our market offering, market position and reputation. \n\n    We offer broad access to clinical testing through a network of laboratories, including advanced laboratories as well as rapid response laboratories (smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times).  We operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our network also includes patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  Our large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding our tests and test results, and help them best utilize our services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction.  We also provide testing (including anatomic pathology) services and medical director services at hospital laboratories.  \n\n    We are a leading provider of diagnostic information services, developing and delivering comprehensive offerings to help physicians manage patients across disease stages, from screening for early risk to treatment selection and monitoring to post-treatment evaluation.  We have comprehensive test offerings in cardiometabolic and endocrine; cancer; clinical drug monitoring and toxicology; infectious disease, including autoimmune; neurology diagnostics, including Alzheimer’s disease; \n\n9 \n\n\nand women’s health, including prenatal genetics.  We strive to provide diagnostic solutions for emerging infectious diseases, and were the first commercial laboratory to introduce a test for the H5 avian flu virus based on a preparedness contract from the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (“CDC”).  We also provide workplace drug testing services, testing urine, hair, and oral fluid specimens, and are certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to perform drug testing using electronic custody and control forms for federally-mandated, safety-sensitive workers.\n\n    We offer a wide range of employer population health services, including biometric screenings, flu shots and related preventative services that leverage clinical data to improve population health outcomes and reduce healthcare spend.  Our solutions enable employers to leverage screening insights to identify chronic disease risks, guide employees to needed in-network care, and improve employee health with intervention services.  Our offerings include connecting participants to the right care at the right time, such as (i) a program designed to prevent diabetes and other chronic conditions, (ii) a program that enables participants to engage with a board-certified physician about their results and be guided to the right next action based on those results,  (iii) a health coaching program to help individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve health outcomes and (iv) a program to facilitate virtual telehealth access to clinical services for participants and adult dependents, with emphasis on reducing risks related to preventable chronic diseases.  These services are sold directly to employers, through resellers and health plan partners.  \n\n    We offer health IT solutions, including our products and national healthcare provider network, to help healthcare organizations and clinicians empower better health by leveraging the power of our significant information assets, including one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, and our technology prowess, including our history of providing leading IT for diagnostic information services.  Our portfolio of offerings is designed to address analytic, clinical and financial needs.  The solutions help healthcare organizations and clinicians analyze and put in context data, and enable them to connect across the healthcare system and engage with their stakeholders.  They can enter, share and access clinical information without costly IT implementation or significant workflow disruption.                \n\n    We offer population health solutions to clinicians, health plans, and hospitals.  Our services build on the power of our information assets and data capabilities and help our customers deliver better care to their patient populations by identifying gaps in care in a population, providing clinical solutions to close the gaps and fostering consumer engagement with a solution.  For example, Quest® Lab StewardshipTM employs machine learning to help clinicians optimize medically-appropriate laboratory test utilization.  Our extended care services (e.g., home collection kits for lab testing) help deliver better care to patient populations by identifying and filling gaps in care for patient populations and by enabling delivery of the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  These services leverage the power of our assets (e.g., our extensive clinical data and data analytics services) and capabilities (e.g., call centers, patient service centers, mobile workforce) and focus on extending the reach of clinician offices beyond their traditional four walls to assess the health of their populations, and doing so when it is convenient for consumers.  Once gaps are identified, we engage patients in our retail sites, in home or by telephone, including through our call centers and our mobile capabilities, including highly trained healthcare professionals.  \n\n    We offer services to pharmaceutical companies, including clinical trials laboratory testing, population analytics and patient engagement services.  We also develop laboratory tests for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) submissions as companion diagnostics and laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) for complementary diagnostics, and offer an array of assets and services to support the development of companion diagnostics, including our robust data set and patient services network.  In addition, we offer Quest Clinical Trials Connect™ to help accelerate clinical trials (and thus the speed of drugs to market) through better patient recruitment, involvement and management, and improved physician outreach.    \n\nDiagnostic Solutions \n\n    Our risk assessment service, ExamOne® is the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in North America and comprises underwriting support services, including data gathering, paramedical examinations and clinical laboratory testing and analytics, designed to assist life insurance companies objectively to evaluate the mortality risks of applicants.  Most specimen collections and paramedical examinations are performed by our network of paramedical examiners at the applicant's home or workplace, but they also are offered at hundreds of our patient service centers and many additional locations.  ExamOne® also offers other national specimen collection and health data solutions that provide fast and accurate insights for clinical research and diagnostics programs, as well as academic studies.  \n\n    We also offer our award-winning Quanum® Enterprise Content Solutions™ for hospitals, to connect data to decision-making and help clinicians advance clinical and operational strategies.  Healthcare organizations use Quanum® Enterprise Content Solutions™ at approximately 1,400 sites in North America.  \n\n10 \n\n\nTHE CLINICAL TESTING INDUSTRY \n\nKey Trends\n\n    The healthcare system in the United States continues to evolve and industry change is likely to be extensive.  Because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term.  There are a number of key trends that we expect will continue to have a significant impact on the growth and the nature of the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends, discussed in the table below, present both opportunities and risks.  We believe that several of the trends, including consolidation, price transparency and consumerization, are favorable to our business.  \n\nKey Trends \n\nReimbursement pressure driven by The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”)Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.  Unfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.  Independent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme.  The three years of cuts exceeded the original 10-year savings projections.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates. \n\nCongress has delayed cuts five times (2021 - 2025) and delayed 2019 data reporting six times (2020 - 2025).  Reimbursement rate reduction from 2026-28 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  \n\nCongress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.   \n\nHealth plans driving value in lab spendingSome hospitals provide outreach testing and may encourage clinicians to send their outreach testing volume to the hospital's laboratory.  Historically, hospitals were able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable services.  In addition, health plans generally reimburse laboratory services provided by non-participating laboratories at higher out-of-network rates.  We are finding increased interest among health plans in driving better value in spending for laboratory testing.  Health plans increasingly are taking steps to encourage the movement of testing volume to high value, lower cost providers like our Company, including by identifying preferred provider partners, plan design changes (e.g., zero-dollar out-of-pocket costs for members using preferred providers) and better aligning reimbursement rates for hospital-based providers and independent commercial laboratories.  The UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network, which chose us to participate, is an example of a health plan taking these steps.  \n\nHealth plans also are increasingly adopting policies, practices and procedures and incorporating requirements imposed by government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid that influence the utilization and reimbursement of testing services.  These policies, practices procedures and requirements are often subject to change without notice.\n\nConsumerizationConsumers are our customers.  Increasingly, consumers are engaged and interested in, and empowered to manage and take direct responsibility for, their own healthcare.  As a result, they are becoming more sophisticated in their understanding of their healthcare needs and their expectations of healthcare providers.  In addition, consumers often are bearing increased financial responsibility for their healthcare (e.g., high deductible health plans; rising deductibles).  In our experience, consumers are more focused on transparency, ease of doing business and better understanding diagnostics information services than they have been in the past.  Consumers increasingly are demanding convenience and a superior and personalized experience relevant to their needs.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw consumers increase their use of telemedicine capabilities, increase their responsibility for their own healthcare (e.g., increased consumer-initiated testing; increased specimen self-collection) and increase their openness to new delivery channels (e.g., retail; convenient \"pop-up\" test centers).  In addition, consumers are seeking prompt, direct access to their test results.  Increasingly, consumers are motivated to find high quality service providers with strong digital experience delivery engines, accessible customer service and lower prices, like our Company.  Our physician-ordered consumer-initiated testing offering is part of our response to this trend.  \n\nPrevention and wellnessWe believe that the value of detection, prevention, wellness and personalized care is well recognized. Government agencies and other customers discussed herein increasingly focus on helping the healthy stay healthy, detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventative insight and care that helps avoid or reduce the negative impacts of a disease. \n\n11 \n\n\nMedical innovationMedical developments are creating new opportunities and new challenges while disrupting the healthcare environment.  For example, digital pathology is a technology that we are currently deploying that may change the practice of pathology.  \n\nContinuing advances in genomics and proteomics are expected to give rise to new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests.  These advances also are spurring interest in and demand for precision medicine, which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing and in which data information services and strategies are used to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  \n\nWe also look for innovations and solutions that are more convenient, less invasive and more cost effective than currently available options.  For instance, our QUEST AD-DETECT®  test portfolio for assessing Alzheimer’s disease risk uses blood specimens, as opposed to testing by more costly or invasive methods, such as testing of cerebral spinal fluid by lumbar puncture.  In 2023, we acquired Haystack Oncology, a cancer testing company that has developed a highly sensitive testing technology for detecting MRD due to residual or recurring cancer.  We believe this acquisition strengthens our comprehensive oncology portfolio by positioning us well to compete in the higher-growth clinical area of ctDNA solid-tumor MRD testing. \n\nWe are collaborating with Universal DX and Mainz Biomed Partners, two biotech companies focused on colorectal cancer.  The collaborations aim to combine innovative liquid biopsy screening technologies with our expertise and scale.  \n\nDemand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients, payers and healthcare providers by improving clinical decision support and access to patient data, and by increasing patient participation in care management and population health management.  \n\nInnovation also includes making healthcare services, including laboratory testing services, more convenient for populations and consumers to access, including at home (e.g., telehealth) or in retail settings.\n\nHealthcare industry evolution; focus on valueConsolidation in the healthcare industry has continued, including among our customers.  Certain of our customers are seeking to diversify their service offerings and to partner with other providers to offer value-based care alternatives.  Consolidation is increasing pricing transparency, and may encourage internalization of clinical testing.  \n\nPhysicians frequently now are employed by hospitals, ACOs or large group practices integrated with hospitals, instead of organizing physician-owned practices, which is impacting the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed in or outside of a hospital.  Physicians and other clinicians also increasingly are being employed by health plans, large retailers, other non-traditional industry entrants (e.g., private equity firms) or their affiliates.  \n\nValue-based reimbursement and demand for convenience and greater availability are contributing to changes in the healthcare system.  ACOs and patient-centered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care.  \n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has refreshed its strategy to address the national push toward value-based care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved.  CMS has stated that the Medicare Sharing Savings Program for ACOs is a critical component of CMS' vision to drive high-quality, person-centered care and promote affordability and sustainability of the Medicare program.  CMS has stated that its goal is for all people in traditional Medicare to be in an ACO by 2030, and is adopting policies to drive growth in ACO participation. \n\nChanges also are taking place in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the United States.  Hospitals are under significant pressure, and hospitals and large retailers are evolving.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine, digital pathology). \n\nPricing transparencyThere has been a trend toward greater pricing transparency in healthcare, including in the laboratory testing marketplace.  Several states have taken action to foster greater pricing transparency in healthcare.  For example, Massachusetts launched a website to help consumers understand the wide variation in healthcare costs.  Federal laws require healthcare providers to provide good faith estimates of costs to self-pay patients, and provide rights and protections for consumers against surprise billing or balance billing.  In addition, the federal government has adopted new legislation and issued new regulations designed to increase transparency regarding pricing and quality in healthcare, including requiring providers, group health plans and insurers to disclose cost information to consumers in advance of care being provided.Increased price transparency, combined with increased patient financial responsibility for medical care, is enhancing purchasing sophistication and fostering changes in behavior in the healthcare marketplace.  We believe that increased price transparency should benefit lower cost, high value providers like our Company.\n\n12 \n\n\nCompetitionThe diagnostic information services industry remains fragmented, highly competitive and subject to new competitors.  Competition is emerging from new technologies (e.g., digital pathology) and growing from non-traditional competitors (e.g., a government agency or an employer establishing its own clinical laboratory for testing; providers of consumer-initiated testing).  Increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.  However, in light of other trends, including continued reimbursement pressure, hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical testing services. \n\nNew industry entrants with extensive resources (e.g., private equity firms) may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations.\n\nHealthcare utilizationHealthcare utilization in the United States has fluctuated based on a number of factors.  These factors include, without limitation, the economy, healthcare benefits design, patients delaying medical care,  increased consumer financial responsibility for, interest in and control of their healthcare, and efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services.   \n\nReimbursement pressure; affordability There is a strong focus in the United States on controlling the overall cost of healthcare. \n\nHealthcare market participants, including governments, are focused on controlling costs.  Examples of cost control approaches include reducing reimbursement for healthcare services, changing reimbursement methodology for healthcare services (e.g., shift from fee for service to capitation), changing medical coverage policies (e.g., healthcare benefits design), denying coverage for services, requiring preauthorization of laboratory testing, requiring co-pays, introducing laboratory spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs and patient-centered medical homes. There is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. \n\nWhile pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our Company, it also creates opportunities, such as an opportunity for increased proper utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare.  We believe that it also creates greater opportunities for consolidation and gaining share for high value, lower-cost providers, like our Company, as compared to other providers.\n\nLegislative, regulatory and policy environment Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the United States is significant and increasing; healthcare payment reform and cost transparency are significant issues.  The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test systems, collection kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States.  The FDA also regulates drugs-of-abuse testing for employers and insurers, testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization.  We offer companion diagnostic testing services to pharmaceutical companies that are regulated by the FDA.  As of May 6, 2024, the FDA announced it was phasing out its general enforcement discretion approach so that LDTs manufactured by a laboratory will generally fall under the same enforcement approach as medical devices.\n\nA number of advanced tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs.  Pursuant to the FDA’s decision to remove enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories like ours, all new and significantly modified previously offered laboratory tests that do not benefit from continued enforcement discretion will have to comply with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \"FDCA\") over a four-year, five-stage process.  Compliance with the FDCA includes, among other things, new quality system regulations and premarket authorization.  One major area of the continued FDA enforcement discretion will apply to many tests that were offered for clinical use prior to May 6, 2024 and that do not afterwards undergo certain material modifications.  \n\nThe removal of enforcement discretion for LDTs could result in a revitalization and passage of legislation or other Congressional action.  The current FDA policy to remove enforcement discretion and/or new legislation is expected to have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating new avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing.\n\n13 \n\n\nUse of healthcare data; technology The increased availability of healthcare data, including data made available as a result of next generation DNA sequencing, and the increased ability to effectively analyze that data at population and patient levels, is impacting healthcare practices.  It is anticipated that the increased use of data in healthcare, coupled with mobile healthcare IT solutions for doctors and patients, will help to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.  We provide automated next generation genetic sequencing, which will enable genetic screening faster and at lower cost.Use of healthcare data, including integrated diagnostic and decision support solutions, predictive analytics, and healthcare IT, is spurring advances in precision medicine, including medical decision making and value, for populations and individuals.  The increased focus on data and its use is increasing focus on maintaining the privacy of patient data.  There is a need for technology solutions to harness these opportunities.  We are subject to certain federal and state regulations that impose interoperability requirements. Healthcare market participants, including many of our customers discussed herein, are striving to leverage interoperability and healthcare data analysis to positively influence the health of patient populations while maintaining patient privacy.\n\nUse of technology, including AINew technology, social media and mobile technology are changing the way that healthcare markets interact with each other, and the expectations that they have about how services are provided, what services are provided, and other capabilities of healthcare market participants.  We have experience using advanced technologies, including AI, to automate processes, improve customer service, generate insights from lab and other data, and stimulate innovation.  We believe AI can help improve the quality of our screening and diagnostic capabilities, as well as our operating efficiency, and expect to continue to be at the forefront of the innovative, responsible and secure use of AI, including generative AI in the diagnostic information services market.  These technology developments are creating new opportunities and new challenges, disrupting the healthcare environment. \n\nChronic diseases and conditions; gaps in careWe believe that the cost and challenges of identifying, treating and controlling chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease are now well recognized.    As a result of multiple factors, including increased focus on population health management and pressure to reduce the systemic costs associated with such diseases and conditions, there is increased focus on better identifying and attempting to reduce or eliminate the gaps in care historically associated with these diseases and conditions.  Healthcare market participants, including Quest, are developing new approaches for this purpose.  \n\nHealthcare services delivery Healthcare delivery is moving out of hospitals, clinician offices and other traditional locations into new settings, such as outpatient, retail, consumer-focused, telemedicine and home settings.  This dynamic offers new opportunities (e.g., mobile phlebotomy services) and challenges for healthcare providers.  We are seeking opportunities to provide diagnostic information services to healthcare providers and consumers.\n\n    We believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lower-cost, high-value providers like Quest, and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.  \n\nCustomer Channels \n\n    We provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers within our primary customer channels of physicians, hospitals, and patients and consumers.  While in many cases, the individual that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services, consumers are more frequently requesting and paying for tests themselves.  Increasingly, patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment.  In the table below, we provide a summary of our different customer channels.  For more information on our growth strategy supporting these customer channels, see above under the heading “Our Strategy\".\n\n14 \n\n\nCustomer Channels\n\nPhysicians, including those associated with ACOs and FQHCsPhysicians and physician assistants requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source for our services.  For more information see \"Our Strategy --Physicians\".\n\nThere has been a marked increase in the number of physician practices owned by hospitals and other companies.  There also has been a notable increase in some branches of medicine of the establishment of very large \"rolled-up\" physician practice groups.  Hospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer outreach testing to the hospital's affiliated laboratory.  Large specialty physician groups may encourage their members to refer testing to other members of the group or to a lab owned by the large physician group.  In each case, referrals to independent diagnostic services providers may be reduced.\n\nWe also serve physicians associated with ACOs and FQHCs.  An ACO is a network of providers and facilities that share financial risk in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare.  ACO members collaborate to provide coordinated, high-quality care to their patients; ACOs may manage the health of a population group, exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care, and function as a payer.  Increasingly, ACOs are focusing on driving improvement in healthcare through value-based services arrangements, and to influence reimbursement for healthcare delivery.  For example, ACOs may be encouraged to consider exclusive arrangements with healthcare providers, or to limit service providers.  The Medicare Sharing Savings Program for ACOs is a critical component of CMS' vision to drive high-quality, person-centered care and promote affordability and sustainability of the Medicare program.  CMS sponsors two additional programs for ACOs, has stated that its goal is for all people in traditional Medicare to be in an ACO by 2030, and is adopting policies to drive growth in ACO participation.  We believe that our experience with value-based arrangements with other payers positions us as a strong partner for ACOs.  In addition, we believe that our extended care experience and population health capabilities are attractive to ACOs. \n\nFQHCs are non-profit, community-directed organizations that offer care to medically underserved patients; FQHCs are the largest primary care system in the United States today.  Their patients are mostly low income, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and are uninsured or publicly insured. We offer an array of services that we believe are attractive to FQHCs as they pursue better outcomes for their patients and maintain financial stability for their organizations.  Our services include our financial assistance programs, customized billing solutions that help to assist patients who struggle to afford testing, home-based collection options and our extensive patient service center network.  We offer solutions for optimizing test utilization, simplifying lab-related tasks, and reducing inefficiencies and duplicative efforts can help FQHCs keep costs in line, and technology solutions that can help them to meet quality reporting requirements and achieve quality measures through benchmarking and identifying areas for improvement.  We also offer a tiered, flexible approach to gaps-in-care programs that helps complement FQHC efforts to emphasize preventive care.  \n\nHospitalsWe believe that we are an industry leader in servicing hospitals and serve approximately half the hospitals in the United States each year in many ways.  For more information, see “Our Strategy—Hospitals.”\n\nPatients and ConsumersWe are well positioned to provide information and insights to patients and individual consumers to help empower them take actions to improve their healthcare.  The changing expectations of patients and individual consumers about their healthcare and their healthcare transactions are influencing our services and the way we provide them.  For more information, see “Our Strategy—Patients and Consumers”.\n\nEmployersEmployers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individual's employability and “fitness for duty.”  Companies with high levels of employee hiring, safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing.  Factors such as the general economy, the job market and changes in the legal environment (e.g., marijuana legalization or decriminalization) can impact the utilization of drugs-of-abuse testing.  Some employers retain third-party administrators to handle such testing and related services; we support the needs of third-party administrators as well as employers who retain us directly.  \n\nEmployers also are investing in population health services.  We meet their needs by providing nationwide access to our customizable services (discussed above), directly and through health plan and health improvement providers.  These services help employers, employees and others manage healthcare costs, capitalize on trends in personalized health and improve health outcomes. \n\nWe seek to grow our employer business through offering new and innovative programs to help them with their goals of (1) maintaining a safe and productive workplace, (2) improving healthcare for employees and (3) lowering healthcare costs for employees and employers.\n\n15 \n\n\nEmerging Retail Healthcare ProvidersIn recent years, we have been seeking the increasing opportunities to provide services to retail providers of healthcare services that have emerged and are growing as customers.  These providers include \"big-box\" retailers, pharmacy chains, supermarkets, urgent care centers and Internet-based service providers.  \n\nWe are taking advantage of opportunities to work with these providers, not only to offer new access partners and new access points for our services (e.g., our collaboration with Safeway), but also to grow our business by expanding our service offerings (e.g., our collaborations with CVS and Walmart).\n\nPharmaceutical companiesWe offer clinical trials testing and have expertise with LDTs for companion and complementary diagnostics, and offer an array of assets and services to support the development of companion diagnostics, including our robust data set and patient services network.  We also offer data services solutions, leveraging our data, analytics and expertise, to help therapy developers understand markets and patient and disease journeys, and plan commercial activity.  In addition, we offer Quest Clinical Trials ConnectTM to help accelerate clinical trials (and thus the speed of drugs to market) through better patient recruitment, involvement and management, and improved physician outreach. \n\nOther Commercial Clinical LaboratoriesWe also provide services on a fee-for-service basis to other commercial clinical laboratories.\n\nHealth Plans, Government Agencies and Other Payers \n\n    Most of the services we perform are paid for by third-party payers, including large national health plans, managed care organizations and other health insurance providers, regional and local health plans and government payers, which includes Medicare and Medicaid.  These customers typically reimburse us as a contracted (or out-of-network) provider for services rendered to their members.  In certain locations, health plans may delegate to Independent Physician Associations (“IPAs”) or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., physician organizations, ACOs, patient-centered medical homes) the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members.  Increasingly, these customers are interested in value-based arrangements.  Health plans and IPAs often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements.  Under capitated payment arrangements, we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  Under some capitated programs, we may provide certain services on a negotiated fee-for-service basis.  Reimbursement under programs that do not provide for capitated payments is typically negotiated on a fee-for-service basis.  Reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled approximately 20%, and no one health plan accounted for 10%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2024.  Health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers, and represent approximately one-half of our total clinical testing volume and approximately 40% of our net revenues from diagnostic information services.  \n\n    There has been a trend of consolidation among health plans.  Some health plans also have narrowed their provider networks.  In addition, some health plans have established \"preferred provider\" networks within their broader networks (e.g., UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network), in effect distinguishing among contracted providers.  We are also sometimes a member of a “complementary network.”  A complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party maintains with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers.  A member of a health plan may choose to access a provider not contracted directly by their health plan but contracted with a complementary network.  In such instance, the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network.  We offer to health plans services and programs that leverage our Company's expertise and resources, including our superior patient access, comprehensive test menu, medical staff, data, IT solutions, and wellness and population health management capabilities.  For the last few years, our Company has had access to a very high percentage of the insured lives in the United States, including very strong access in key high-population states.  We believe that this strong access increases our attractiveness to other customer channels, including physicians, patients and employers.\n\n    We also provide services on a fee-for-service basis to federal, state and local governmental agencies.  Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government.  Over the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs.  There has been growth of health insurance providers offering \n\n16 \n\n\nMedicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.  States also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.  We also provide additional services to and in conjunction with government agencies across the United States.  For example, in 2024, we were awarded several contracts by the CDC to support testing and sustained laboratory readiness for two emerging infectious diseases.  The arrangements will support the preparedness for certain viruses by ensuring a national commercial laboratory provider is able to quickly supplement public health laboratories in the event there is an infectious disease outbreak in people. \n\nCompetition\n\n    While there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, which we expect to continue, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, including smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories; hospital-affiliated laboratories; and physician-office laboratories.  Our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc.  We also compete with other providers, including large physician group practices and providers of consumer-initiated testing.  In anatomic pathology, we compete with anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices, and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions.  Some physician practices establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices.\n\n    Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient).  In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.  As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing.  In addition, hospitals may have more, or more convenient, locations in a market.  Hospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory.  There has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.  Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.  The formation of ACOs and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.  In addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (e.g., employers; government agencies) and market activity may continue to increase the competitive environment.\n\n    We believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, deep medical and scientific expertise, high quality, leading access and distribution, and data-powered integrated IT solutions provide us with a competitive advantage.  We believe that as a large diagnostic information services provider we can serve our customers more effectively due to our larger network and lower cost structure.  In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment.  \n\n    The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology, new product introductions and new service offerings.  Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Digital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this.  Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.  Competitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  \n\n    The risk assessment and healthcare IT industries are highly competitive.  We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources.  We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors, faster services completion and a superior applicant experience.  We compete in the healthcare IT industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, particularly smaller and medium sized physician practices.\n\n17 \n\n\nGENERAL \n\n    Human Capital Management.  In 2023 we introduced The Quest Way, which has three core components: Our Purpose: why we exist; our Strategy: how we grow; and our Culture: how we work.  Our focus on delivering across The Quest Way drives our approach to human capital management.  Effectively managing our human capital resources is a priority with key components that include culture, safety and well-being programs, and employee engagement, and attracting, training, development and succession planning.  Our Board of Directors oversees our human capital management, including by receiving management reports on key areas, strategies, and initiatives.  Additional information about our human capital management strategies and initiatives is available in our annual corporate responsibility report. \n\n    As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately 56,000 employees globally (including LifeLabs’ approximately 6,600), of whom approximately 45,000 are full-time and the remainder are part-time or on-call.  Our employee population is more diverse than the U.S. workforce, taken as a whole. Approximately 70% of our employees globally are women (including approximately 75% at LifeLabs); approximately 50% of our global team are diverse.  A majority of our employees work directly with our customers or in our laboratories.  Fewer than 1% of our U.S. employees are represented by a union.  We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.  \n\n    Culture.  We foster a strong culture, built on our Code of Ethics, which reinforces our commitment to integrity and aligns with our Purpose and brand.  In 2023, we introduced The Quest Way and the 5Cs of Culture —Customer First, Care, Curiosity, Collaboration and Continuous Improvement—to define the behaviors we value and aspire to, every day.  The 5Cs are integrated into our daily management practices, including recognition, training and performance reviews, to encourage all employees to embody the 5Cs in their daily activities. \n\n    We understand the need to create an environment where employees can bring their whole selves to work, and our philosophy embodies our commitment to promote inclusion and diversity by consistently inviting new perspectives and exploring new experiences.  We aim to harness the unique mix of capabilities, talents, cultures, beliefs and experience of our employees and create a workforce that feels comfortable sharing these perspectives. We focus on Culture, Talent and Community across the entire talent lifecycle and prioritize supporting all employees throughout their careers at Quest.  We continue to prioritize our leadership training programs supporting early careerists, mid-career managers and senior executives.  Additionally, we launched a council comprised of leaders from our Employee Business Networks to offer regular feedback to organizational leaders on opportunities to further enhance our culture.\n\n    Our Quest Management System, supports our effort to maintain a focus on high performance.  We also focus on building and maintaining a collaborative, diverse and inclusive culture in which all employees are empowered to raise and discuss difficult issues and are valued for their strengths, experience and unique perspectives.  We encourage our employees to actively participate in their communities, and support their participation, through our Employee Business Networks and Matching Gift Program.  Our Everyday Excellence program  elevates our focus on the 5C of Customer First through guiding principles for our entire organization to support a superior customer experience and inspire employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction; the program is integrated into frontline employee behavioral standards.  Our Recognition Quest Program reinforces our commitment to recognize above and beyond contributions and to demonstrating how much we value, care for and appreciate one another by regularly celebrating and rewarding one another as we work together.\n\n    Safety and Well-Being.  The health and safety of our employees is of paramount concern. We use a systematic, risk-based approach to develop tailored incident prevention and response programs designed to keep our employees safe in each of our diverse functional areas and use data insights and a detailed audit program to foster the effectiveness of our programs.  We have a comprehensive curriculum of annual safety training, as well as training for new employees.  As part of our comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits program, we also offer innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employees and their families through our HealthyQuest™ program.  The cornerstone of HealthyQuest™ is our Blueprint for Wellness® program, which empowers our employees and their spouses and partners with health insights based on lab and biometric data and invites them each year to take the initiative to improve their physical and mental health.  We also offer comprehensive medical and mental health plans.  For example, our mental health support service, launched in 2022, is widely used among our employees and their dependents.  HealthyQuest™ focuses on prevention, progression and reversal, through which we offer a HealthyQuest™ Employee Business Network and intervention programs designed to engage employees in managing their health, including access to medical expertise and support programs tailored to their individual needs, helping them to adopt healthier behaviors and access better care at lower costs.  These programs include customized \n\n18 \n\n\nprograms for conditions such as type 2 diabetes management, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, specialty drugs, weight management, zero-cost lab testing, and special support for orthopedic surgery and for cancer and other serious diagnoses. \n\n    Engagement.  Actively listening to our employees is fundamental to Quest’s culture. We have always sought to foster the engagement of our employees and take action to improve the employee experience, through the use of regular employee insight surveys.  Employee engagement has been a metric in the annual incentive plan for our executive officers since 2013. Since 2020, our strategy for gathering employee feedback utilizes more frequent employee insight surveys.  This approach is designed to build an agile culture, based on continuous feedback that fuels ongoing conversations about priorities, performance, opportunities and growth, to result in a higher performing organization and committed employees.  To gain deeper insights, we expanded our 2024 program to include a culture insights survey, providing an enterprise-wide view of the employee experience in relation to our Purpose and the 5Cs. This is complemented by team-level insights from our employee insights, and lifecycle surveys for new hire and departing staff.  In addition, we hold regular monthly meetings among hundreds of company leaders to foster increased communication across the company regarding topics of concern to employees. \n\n    Attracting, Training, Development and Succession Planning.  We have a strong program designed to attract a diverse, qualified work force that will assist us to achieve our business goals.  For example, we are partnering with universities and specialized healthcare schools to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology, and we have teamed up with a third-party phlebotomy training program to train and certify phlebotomist candidates who can join our ranks upon graduation.  We provide training on a wide array of topics to our employees through live and online formats, including opportunities that can be accessed through their mobile devices.  We also offer a number of development opportunities for our employees through a robust library of offerings in our Learning Management System, EMPower.  We also offer mentoring and education programs, including a higher education tuition assistance program, My Quest for Education.  Among participants in the My Quest for Education program, 52% have received promotions and 34% have made lateral career moves.  In 2024, we introduced INSPIRE, a frontline development program focused on enhancing service excellence for our customer-facing employees.  In addition, we provide leadership training opportunities for employees at all levels, including a manager essentials curriculum, our Leading Quest Supervisor and Manager Core program, our director-level Leading Quest for Business Impact program, Financial Acumen for Business Leaders, leadership coaching programs and trainings to strengthen critical leadership skills.  We also deliver a number of programs tailored to specific functions to drive a high-performance culture and sharpen the capabilities needed to lead our organization (e.g., programs focused on Commercial, Finance, Pathology, R&D, and Product Development).  Quest’s robust talent review and succession planning process assesses current and future organizational needs in combination with the capabilities and aspirations of our employees to ensure we have the right talent, in the right roles, at the right time.  For leaders, we have robust succession plans and leverage several inputs, inclusive of formal assessments, to inform customized development plans.\n\n    Sales and Marketing.  Our Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services.  It coordinates closely with our clinical franchises (discussed above under the heading \"Organized to Drive Growth and Value\") and marketing organization.  The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers.  Our commercial organization employs leading processes and tools and strong management discipline.  We provide industry-leading training and development, focus on opportunities with hospitals and specialty physicians, and foster a customer-focused, performance-driven culture.  We also maintain distinct sales and marketing organizations for our offerings in Diagnostic Solutions and our employer testing services. \n\n    Information Technology.  We use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of data.  We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers.  The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems.  We take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our IT systems.\n\n    Some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems.  We have made significant progress implementing common systems in our regional laboratories, and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations.  We expect that our standardization efforts will take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment.  Even after we complete our efforts to standardize our legacy systems, we will need to focus on standardizing systems in connection with future business acquisitions.  \n\n19 \n\n\n    Quality Assurance.  As discussed further under the heading \"Continuous Quality Improvement\", our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality, and to meet that goal we employ the Quest Management System.  Employing root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring, we continuously seek to enhance quality, reduce defects, further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes, eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our Company. \n\n    In our laboratory operations, our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, appropriate specimen transport, analysis and report accuracy, reference interval establishment and review, statistical process control and personnel training for our laboratories and patient service centers.  As part of our quality assurance program, we utilize internal proficiency testing, comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits.  We have introduced comprehensive and digitized data analytics software that implements advanced automated quality control procedures, offering both real-time and post-analytic analysis of data at the laboratory and corporate level.  We monitor test results to identify trends, biases, instrument failures and population shifts through digitization and data analytics.  We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff.  For example, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.\n\n    We have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as CMS, The College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and certain states.  All of our laboratories participate in external quality surveillance programs, including proficiency testing programs administered by CAP and several state agencies.  CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (“CLIA”).  CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe.  All of our major laboratories, including our laboratories outside the United States, a number of our rapid response laboratories, and our biorepository facility are accredited by the CAP.  Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program.  In addition, some of our laboratories also have International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification for their quality management systems.  For example, in 2023, we achieved ISO 14001 certification for our Cleveland HeartLab and laboratory facility in Chantilly, VA.  ISO 14001 is an internationally recognized management system that leverages leadership involvement and employee engagement to help organizations ensure compliance with regulatory standards, improve their environmental performance, provide a competitive advantage and gain the trust of stakeholders, and achieve strategic goals by incorporating environmental issues into business management.\n\n    We maintain a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure a high-quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectation across that network.  We expect suppliers to provide the highest quality products and services and to embrace an ethic of transparent quality collaboration.  In our Supplier Quality Program, we aim to ensure and improve the quality of purchased products and services.  Our suppliers are expected to operate under quality management principles that meet industry standards, strive for zero defect manufacturing, use statistical analysis to reduce variation and meet applicable regulatory standards.  In choosing suppliers, we evaluate their quality systems and quality performance metrics.  Our supplier qualification process is risk-based, with assessments and on-site audits based on risk tiers and supplier quality management system compliance.  Contracts with our suppliers include specific quality, compliance, and change management provisions as appropriate.  We use supplier quality engineers who are trained to audit on ISO standards and FDA regulations applicable to suppliers’ processes, and a procurement engineering team to assist with qualification and validation of new supplies and products.  We actively manage supplier performance, utilizing a problem reporting and resolution process designed to drive to root cause and corrective actions.  We maintain a continuous improvement dialogue with our suppliers, and with operationally critical suppliers deliver a supplier scorecard that supports continuous improvement. \n\n    We also maintain quality assurance programs for hospital laboratories that we manage, and for our services offerings outside laboratories. \n\n    Intellectual Property Rights.  We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries.  From time to time, we also license patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others; we also may license our intellectual property to others.  In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business.  We believe, however, that no single intellectual property asset is material to our business as a whole.  Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise.  We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.\n\n20 \n\n\n    Enterprise Risk Management Program.  We maintain an enterprise risk management program, which is led by our executive leadership and overseen by our Board of Directors, that is designed to promote a culture of risk awareness throughout the Company's key business, operations and support functions.  Our program, which is integrated with the Company’s governance, performance management and internal control frameworks, entails a formal continuous process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence its business strategy and performance.  The program, which is managed by an enterprise risk management team, is designed based on the most recent framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and we benchmark it against best practices.  We focus on the following risk types:\n\n•Operational risk - risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the Company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence, including: product life-cycle and execution; service quality and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human capital, reputation and environmental.\n\n•Financial risk - risks arising from the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives, including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity, interest rate, credit, pricing and reimbursement, and also to internal and external financial reporting.   \n\n•Legal and compliance risk - risks arising from the regulatory and enforcement environment, legal proceedings and adherence to ethics and compliance policies and procedures.   \n\n•Strategic risk - risks that will impede the Company’s plan to achieve its Purpose and apply its core values, including changes in the broad market and Company's industry, business development and restructuring activities, competitive threats and practices, technology and product innovation, and public policy.  \n\n    As part of our program, together with our Board of Directors, we routinely assess our enterprise level risks, emerging risks, overall Company-level risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management, and monitor the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation.  Our Board of Directors and its committees receive updates and training from internal and external experts on topics that are relevant to overall risk management.  Our primary risk factors are discussed in \"Risk Factors\" below.     \n\n    Billing; Government Reimbursement.  We generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules; fees may be negotiated or discounted.  The types of fee schedules are:\n\n•“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.\n\n•“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.\n\n    Billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated.  Our customers have different billing requirements.  Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers; incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians; and lack of access to patients before testing).  We maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices, and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures. \n\n    With regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we generally must bill Medicare directly and must accept the Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full.  In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare.  Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible and co-insurance for anatomic pathology services. \n\n    Part B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules.  Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year.  Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.  Unfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.  Independent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme.  The three years of cuts exceeded the original 10-year savings projections.  \n\n21 \n\n\nPAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates.  Congress has delayed cuts five times (2021 - 2025) and delayed 2019 reporting six times (2020 - 2025).  Reimbursement rate reduction from 2026-28 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  Congress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.  \n\nREGULATION \n\nWe are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and to government inspections and audits. \n\nKey Regulatory Schemes\n\nCLIA and State Clinical Laboratory LicensingCLIA regulates the operations of virtually all clinical laboratories, including our laboratories in the United States, requiring that they be certified by the federal government and that they comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable and timely.  \n\nState laws may require additional personnel qualifications or licenses, quality control, record maintenance, proficiency testing or detailed review of our scientific method validations and technical procedures for certain tests. \n\nViolations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid; Fraud and AbuseDiagnostic testing services provided under Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to complex, evolving, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to billing, coverage and reimbursement.  Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs.  In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have an ownership or investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the testing laboratory, unless specific exceptions are met.Some states have similar laws that are not limited in applicability to only Medicare and Medicaid referrals and could also affect tests that are paid for by health plans and other non-governmental payers. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs. \n\n22 \n\n\nFDAThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test systems, collection kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States.  The FDA also regulates drugs-of-abuse testing for employers and insurers, testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization.  We offer companion diagnostic testing services to pharmaceutical companies that are regulated by the FDA.  As of May 6, 2024, the FDA announced it was phasing out its general enforcement discretion approach so that LDTs manufactured by a laboratory will generally fall under the same enforcement approach as medical devices.A number of advanced tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs.  Pursuant to the FDA’s decision to remove enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories like ours, all new and significantly modified previously offered laboratory tests that do not benefit from continued enforcement discretion will have to comply with the FDCA over a four-year, five-stage process.  Compliance with the FDCA includes, among other things, new quality system regulations and premarket authorization.  One major area of the continued FDA enforcement discretion will apply to many tests that were offered for clinical use prior to May 6, 2024 and that do not afterwards undergo certain material modifications.  The removal of enforcement discretion for LDTs could result in a revitalization and passage of legislation or other Congressional action.  The current FDA policy to remove enforcement discretion and/or new legislation is expected to have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating new avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing.\n\nEnvironmental, Health and SafetyWe are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. \n\nFor example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the United States  This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. \n\nFor purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. \n\nPhysiciansOur pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice.  The manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these jurisdictions to oversee the practice of medicine.  Several jurisdictions in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine.  In these jurisdictions, anatomic pathology services are delivered through physician-owned entities that employ the practicing pathologists.    \n\nPrivacy and Security of Health and Personal InformationWe are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including, but not limited to: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws (e.g., California) and similar laws in other states; and (c) laws outside the U.S., including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and provincial health privacy laws, and similar laws in other jurisdictions.  We may be subject to penalties for non-compliance and may be required to notify individuals or state, federal or county governments if we discover certain breaches of personal information or protected health information. \n\nDrug Testing; Controlled SubstancesAll U.S. laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. \n\nTo obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs-of-abuse testing in the United States, laboratories must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. \n\n23 \n\n\n    Compliance.  We strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  We license and maintain appropriate accreditations for all of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, as required by federal and state agencies.  We have a long-standing and well-established compliance program.  The Quality and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, and receives periodic management reports regarding, our compliance program.  Our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws and regulations (including regarding billing and reimbursement, and privacy of protected health information and personally identifiable information) and Company policies.  Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations.  We conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.\n\n    As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported or suspected failures to comply with Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement requirements.  As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, refunded the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action. \n\n24 \n\n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\n    The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) maintains an internet site, www.sec.gov, that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers file electronically with the SEC.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\n    You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities.  The risks below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently deem immaterial, may also negatively impact us.  Our business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or reputation , or the price of our common stock, could be materially impacted by any of these factors.\n\n    This Report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties.  Our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face described below and elsewhere.  See “Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results.” \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system continues to evolve, and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\n\n    The U.S. healthcare system continues to evolve.  Significant change is taking place in the healthcare system, including as discussed above under the heading \"The Clinical Testing Industry\".  For example, value-based reimbursement is increasing (e.g., UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network) and CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved by 2030.  Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare.  Healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine, digital pathology).  Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services.  In addition, we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing.  The regulatory environment related to reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under Medicare are in flux and we also believe that health plans and consumers increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive. \n\n    We also believe that health plans and consumers increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive. \n\nThe clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\n\n    The clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, including smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.  We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices, large physician group practices and providers of consumer-initiated testing.  Hospitals and companies that directly or indirectly employ or manage physicians also present a competitive threat to our business.  Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient).  In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.  As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing.  There has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.  Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories, even encouraging or requiring the practices they own to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory, strengthening their competitive position further.  The formation of ACOs and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.  In addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (e.g., employers; government agencies).\n\n    The diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions.  Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing (e.g., technology enabled by AI).  Digital pathology is an example of this.  Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.  Competitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  \n\nGovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.  \n\n    We face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services.  One example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements.  We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.\n\n     Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020.  Unfortunately, as a result of a flawed implementation of PAMA, the data collected did not accurately represent the laboratory market as required under PAMA.  Independent laboratories were overrepresented, and hospitals and physician office laboratories were underrepresented, making the first round of PAMA cuts too extreme.  The three years of cuts exceeded the original 10-year savings projections.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates.  Congress has delayed cuts five times (2021 - 2025) and delayed 2019 reporting six times (2020 - 2025).  Reimbursement rate reduction from 2026-28 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  Congress reintroduced federal legislation in 2023 (the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act), which would reform PAMA and create a true market-based CLFS.   \n\n    In addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services that are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis.  Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures.  \n\n    In addition, over the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called “Medicare Advantage” programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs.  There has been growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.  States have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.  In addition, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, denying claims and service coverage restrictions.  Further, CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved by 2030.\n\n    Reimbursement for Medicare services also is subject to annual reduction under the Budget Control Act of 2011, and the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.       \n\n    From time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries while maintaining quality and access to care.  Congress also periodically considers cost-saving initiatives, which have included coinsurance for clinical testing services, co-payments for clinical testing and further laboratory physician fee schedule reductions.  \n\n    Other steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes to obtain payment, increased documentation requirements, limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency, expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials.  \n\n    Steps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\n\nHealth plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services. \n\n    We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services.  Examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services.  There is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.  We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services.  ACOs and hospitals also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.\n\n    The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with us and other clinical testing providers.  The increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency, insurer bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with an insurer.  Health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements.  Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions, requiring additional documentation for claims \n\n30 \n\n\npayment and requiring preauthorization of certain testing.  There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\n\n    Other steps taken to reduce utilization and reimbursement include requirements to obtain diagnosis codes (which can be inconsistent between health plans and government payers) to obtain payment, increased documentation requirements, limiting the allowable number of tests or ordering frequency, expanded prior authorization programs and otherwise increasing payment denials.  \n\n    Steps to reduce utilization and reimbursement also discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\n\nFailure to develop, acquire licenses for, introduce, or commercialize new tests, technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume, revenues and profitability.\n\n    The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and regulation and new product introductions.  Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs.  In addition, our competitors or other companies could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services.  Our success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to develop or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms.  We may be unable to develop, introduce or commercialize new solutions or services.  Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing, that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business.  We also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and licensing arrangements that we do enter into may not yield commercially successful clinical tests.  If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, commercialize newly licensed tests or technologies, or obtain appropriate coverage or reimbursement for such tests, our research and development and other costs may increase as a result.  In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.\n\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards, or to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services, could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\n\n    The provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks.  The services that we provide are intended to provide information in providing patient care.  Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\n\n    Claims of injury or other adverse events can result from the provision of our services.  We may be sued under medical liability or other liability laws for alleged acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under our supervision.  We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO CHANGE IN PUBLIC POLICY \n\nAND THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nSignificant changes or developments in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. healthcare regulation, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n    There is uncertainty surrounding potential changes to the regulatory environment in the United States, particularly as it relates to healthcare regulation and related programs, following the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in November 2024, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  For example, the incoming administration announced a planned advisory commission to reform federal government processes and reduce expenditures.  Pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government’s budget, and potential changes in budgetary priorities, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs, including Medicare and other government programs upon which our business depends. Additionally, changes in legislation and regulations (including those related to taxation, trade and importation), economic and monetary policies, geopolitical matters, among other potential impacts, could adversely impact the global economy and our \n\n31 \n\n\noperating results.  The potential impact of new policies that may be implemented as a result of the new administration is currently uncertain.\n\nWe are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\n\n    Our business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions where we engage in business, including Canada and Europe.  While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been extensively interpreted by the courts, including, among other things, many of those relating to:\n\n•billing and reimbursement of clinical testing;\n\n•certification or licensure of clinical laboratories;\n\n•the anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;\n\n•the laws and regulations administered by the FDA;\n\n•the corporate practice of medicine;\n\n•operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n\n•physician fee splitting;\n\n•relationships with physicians and hospitals;\n\n•marketing to consumers;\n\n•protection and privacy of patient data and other personal information;\n\n•use of AI;\n\n•safety and health of laboratory employees; and\n\n•handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.\n\n    These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  We may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services.  If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.\n\n    We regularly receive requests for information, and occasionally subpoenas, from governmental authorities.  We also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers.”  The federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.  In addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n\n•diversion of management time and attention;\n\n•expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;\n\n•increases to our administrative, billing or other operating costs;\n\n•limitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;\n\n•enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;\n\n•decreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed;\n\n•adverse effects to important business relationships with third parties;\n\n•decreased demand for our services; and/or\n\n32 \n\n\n•injury to our reputation.\n\n    Changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification or withdrawal.  Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.\n\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted by the FDA's approach to regulation. \n\n    The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test systems, collection kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States.  We offer companion diagnostic testing services to pharmaceutical companies that are regulated by the FDA.  A number of tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs.   \n\n    The FDA's regulation of clinical laboratory testing is expected to impact industry practices and participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.  As of May 6, 2024, the FDA announced it was phasing out its general enforcement discretion approach so that LDTs manufactured by a laboratory will generally fall under the same enforcement approach as medical devices.  A number of advanced tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs.  Pursuant to the FDA’s decision to remove enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories like ours, all new and significantly modified previously offered laboratory tests that do not benefit from continued enforcement discretion will have to comply with the FDCA over a four-year, five-stage process.  Compliance with the FDCA includes, among other things, new quality system regulations and premarket authorization.  One major area of the continued FDA enforcement discretion will apply to many tests that were offered for clinical use prior to May 6, 2024 and that do not afterwards undergo certain material modifications.  The removal of enforcement discretion for LDTs could result in a revitalization and passage of legislation or other Congressional action.  The current FDA policy to remove enforcement discretion and/or new legislation is expected to have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating new avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing.  New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.\n\n    For more information, see above under the heading “Regulation\".  \n\nFailure to accurately bill for our services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n    Billing for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements.  Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups.  The majority of billing and related operations for our Company are being provided by a third party under the Company's oversight.  Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims.  Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed.  The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies, like us, on behalf of government payers, private payers and/or patients alleging inappropriate billing practices.\n\n    Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable billing-related laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion.  The federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.  The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  We believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse. \n\n33 \n\n\nWe are subject to numerous political (including geopolitical), legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.\n\n    Our international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in non-U.S. markets, which may vary by market and include: intellectual property legal protections and remedies; weak legal systems which may, among other things, affect our ability to enforce contractual rights; trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, supply, reimbursement and marketing of products and services; existing and emerging data privacy regulations affecting the processing and transfer of personal data; new regulations relating to the use of AI; and challenges based on differing languages, cultures and unfamiliar practices.  International operations also require us to devote management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, and to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.\n\n    We may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights.  In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation, and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\n•cease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\n•obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\n\n•redesign or re-engineer our tests;\n\n•change our business processes; or\n\n•pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\n\nAdverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.\n\n    We are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, disputes as to intellectual property, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental authorities and Medicare or Medicaid carriers.  Some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management's attention from operations.  These proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages and reputational harm.\n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS \n\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\n\n    As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $6.2 billion of debt outstanding.  Other than credit facilities in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available.  Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants.  These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt.  We have obtained ratings on our public debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings.  There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant.  If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase.  Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.\n\n    We or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  Increases in interest rates may increase our financing costs making it more challenging for us to incur additional debt necessary to fund our operations and strategic objectives.  Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing.  In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us.  As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.\n\n34 \n\n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\n\nThe development of new technologies is rapidly changing diagnostic testing, which will impact the healthcare industry and the competitive environment.  The development of new, more cost-effective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients, which could accelerate the internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\n\n    The diagnostic information services industry is facing rapidly changing technology and innovations in product offerings, including technology that enables more convenient, accessible and cost-effective testing.  For example, digital pathology is a technology that we are currently deploying that may change the practice of pathology and our role in it.  Competitors also may offer new testing services that can be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be administered by physicians in their offices, complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA and may be performed by consumers in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits.  Additionally, some traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, are consolidating, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site.  Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some non-routine and advanced testing.  These technological advances (and the ones yet to come) and the continued internalization of testing services may lead to the need for less frequent testing and/or less use of the testing services we offer.\n\nWe have been and expect to continue to use AI technology in the testing services we offer.  The challenges with properly managing the development and use of these technological innovations could result in harm to our reputation, business or customers, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n    We have been and expect to continue to use AI technology in our testing services, and we anticipate it will become increasingly important to us over time.  This technology, including generative AI, which is in its early stages of commercial implementation, presents a number of risks inherent in its use, including risks related to cybersecurity, privacy and data security and use practices.  Additionally, AI technology can create accuracy issues and other outcomes that could harm our customers and negatively impact our reputation and our business.  Further, our competitors may develop new testing services and other products relying on AI more rapidly or more successfully than us, which could hinder our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.  Using AI successfully will require significant resources, including having the technical expertise required to develop, test and maintain AI-based testing services.  In addition, we anticipate that there will continue to be new regulatory requirements concerning the use of AI, which may aim to regulate, limit, or block the use of AI in our testing and other services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may hinder their usability or effectiveness.\n\nHardware and software failures or delays in our IT systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions, services and support provided by third parties, or otherwise, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.\n\n    IT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data.  Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems.  A failure or delay in our IT systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential data.  Despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including the age of the technology, telecommunications or network failures, system conversion, standardization or modernization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters.  For example, in February 2025, we committed to a multi-year project (\"Project Nova\") to modernize our \"Order to Cash\" business processes including related information technology infrastructure and underlying enabling technologies.  These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business, including manufacturers and developers of the hardware and software we use, and over which we have limited control.  Any disruption or failure of our IT systems, including in connection with Project Nova, could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients, including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace, or otherwise adversely impact our business. \n\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to strengthen our efficiency.\n\n35 \n\n\n    It is important that we continue to strengthen our efficiency to promote our competitive position and enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of diagnostic information services, and to partly offset pressures from the current inflationary environment, including labor and benefit cost increases, and reimbursement pressures.\n\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.  \n\n    In our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information.  If we do not use or adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.  These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control.  In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\n    We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws (e.g., California) and similar laws in other states; and (c) laws outside the United States, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and provincial health privacy laws, and similar laws in other jurisdictions.\n\nOur approach to corporate responsibility may not satisfy all our stakeholders.\n\n    We regularly assess opportunities and risks related to corporate responsibility, which includes sustainability, social and governance matters.  As part of this process, we make decisions related to these matters and may set goals and targets related to sustainability and social matters.  We have a broad range of stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, patients and communities we serve, some of whom increasingly focus on corporate responsibility considerations.  In addition, some of our stockholders, employees and patients may consider corporate responsibility factors in making investment, employment and service provider decisions.  Our ability to achieve the goals we may set related to corporate responsibility matters are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.  Despite our efforts, we may not achieve our goals on the timetable we set or at all.  Additionally, certain of our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our decisions related to corporate responsibility matters, the goals we set, our progress towards these goals or the resulting outcomes.  This could lead to negative perceptions of, or loss of support for, our business, difficulty recruiting or attracting new employees and our stock price being negatively impacted.\n\nThe IT systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering, cyberattack or other security breach.   \n\n    Our IT systems have been and are subject to potential cyberattacks, tampering or other security breaches.  These attacks, if successful, could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our IT systems and/or in unauthorized persons exfiltrating and misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information, including patient and employee data that we collect, transmit and store on and through our IT systems.\n\n    External actors may develop and deploy viruses, other malicious software programs, ransomware attacks, distributed denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm or obtain unauthorized access to our systems, including through the use of AI and other emerging technologies.  External actors may also deploy programs targeting our employees which are designed to attack our IT systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities through programs such as electronic spamming, phishing, smishing, spear phishing or similar tactics.  As a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks, intrusions and breaches, failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified, which could further increase these costs and consequences.  Additionally, new technology that we deploy to automate processes, improve customer service, generate insights from lab and other data and stimulate innovation to improve operational efficiency, including the expanded use of AI, may further expose our IT systems to the risk of cyberattacks and may create the need for rapid modifications to our cybersecurity program.  Also, an increasing risk of civil unrest, political tensions, wars or other military conflicts may also impact the cybersecurity threat risk landscape.\n\n36 \n\n\n    Although the Company has robust security measures implemented, which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties, cybersecurity threats against us continue to evolve and may not be recognized until after an incident.  In August 2021, ReproSource, our subsidiary, experienced a data security incident in which an unauthorized party may have accessed or acquired protected health information and personally identifiable information of ReproSource patients (in connection with the incident, ReproSource discovered and contained ransomware).  The Company’s other systems were not impacted or compromised by this incident.  Although the attacks we have experienced have not materially disrupted, interrupted, damaged or shutdown the Company's IT systems, or materially disrupted the Company's performance of its business, the mitigation or remediation efforts that we have undertaken, and may undertake in the future, require the attention of management and expenditures of resources, which can be significant.  There can be no assurance that the Company can anticipate all evolving future attacks, viruses or intrusions, implement adequate preventative measures, or remediate any security vulnerabilities on a timely basis or at all.  If our IT systems are successfully attacked, it could result in major and/or prolonged disruption of our business, compromise confidential information, and result in litigation and potential liability for the Company, government investigation, significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\n    In addition, third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions, or with whom we interface, store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information, as well as those third parties’ providers, are also subject to the risks outlined above.  For example, in June 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA), informed the Company that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system.  AMCA previously provided debt collection services for the Company and provided debt collection services for a company that provides revenue management services to the Company.  AMCA’s affected system included financial, medical and other personal information.  The Company’s systems or databases were not involved in this incident.  A breach or attack affecting third parties with whom we engage could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.  Additionally, many of the third-party service providers we rely on use generative AI for a variety of purposes, which increases the risk that our sensitive and proprietary data, and the data of our patients and customers, could be inadvertently or maliciously exposed.\n\n    We have taken, and continue to take, precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, and detect and respond to, future cybersecurity threats, and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property, patient and employee data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems.  We also have taken, and will continue to take, measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions, or with whom we interface, store or process confidential patient and employee data or other confidential information.  In addition, we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cybersecurity threats and have worked with firms that have cyber security expertise to evaluate our systems and the attacks we experience and strengthen our systems.  There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our third-party providers will prevent, contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees and maintain good relations with our employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\n\n    The supply of qualified technical, professional, managerial and other personnel, including cytotechs, phlebotomists and specimen processors, is currently constrained; competition for qualified employees, even across different industries, is intense, including as individuals leave the job market.  We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical, professional or other employees. \n\n    In addition, we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.  However, unfavorable labor environments, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties.  If any of these events were to occur, the Company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business.\n\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult.\n\n    We plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing arrangements, investments and alliances.  However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities.  Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business \n\n37 \n\n\nopportunity, and to integrate the new businesses, manage the costs related to any such integration and to retain key technical, professional or management personnel.  The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners.  Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.\n\n    Acquisitions are not all the same (e.g., asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests); different acquisitions offer different risks.  Acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures.  Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the diligence and integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, or introduction of IT security vulnerabilities not adequately investigated during diligence or managed after acquisition, the integration and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses and of our existing business, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results.  The process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:\n\n•loss of key customers or employees;\n\n•difficulty and/or delays in standardizing information and other systems;\n\n•difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n\n•failure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;\n\n•failing to satisfy the performance requirements of the physicians associated with an acquired outreach business;\n\n•diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and\n\n•the added costs of dealing with such disruptions.\n\n    If we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.  Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner. \n\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, public health emergencies and pandemics, geopolitical matters, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities. \n\n    We operate facilities primarily across the United States, and consumers frequently visit our facilities in person.  The ability of our employees and consumers to access our facilities may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tropical storms, floods, fires, or other extreme weather conditions, including major winter storms, droughts and heat waves; public health emergencies and pandemics; geopolitical matters, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other activities.  Although we maintain a business continuity program to prepare for and respond to such events, because of their unpredictable nature, these events may limit or interrupt our ability to conduct operations.  Additionally, such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services.  These events also may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties.    \n\nAny future public health emergencies or pandemics may negatively affect us, including through its impact on the labor force and supply chain. \n\n    We are subject to risks associated with public health emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future public health emergency or pandemic could expose us to the risks we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and result in, among other things, a reduction in physician office visits and diagnostic testing volume, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, or customers closing or curtailing their operations, as well as increased unemployment and loss of health insurance.  We may also experience labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and price increases in testing equipment and supplies, as a result of a public health emergency or pandemic.  Suppliers and manufacturers we rely upon may experience disruptions and delays stemming from raw material and labor shortages, supply challenges and significant disruptions in transport and logistics services due to facility closures, labor constraints and other challenges.  These challenges may affect our ability to transport specimens, receive equipment, supplies or materials, or otherwise provide our services in a timely manner or at a reasonable price.  In addition, labor shortages may affect our ability to achieve our staffing or productivity goals. \n\n38 \n\n\n    The extent to which we may be impacted by future public health emergencies and pandemics will depend on many factors beyond our knowledge or control.  These factors include: the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any public health emergency or pandemic; increases in infection rates and the geographic location of such increases; the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of any public health emergency or pandemic on supply chain and the global economy.  To the extent any future public health emergency or pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this Report.  \n\nInflationary pressures could adversely impact us because of increases in the costs of materials, supplies and services, and increased labor and people-related expenses.\n\n    Inflationary pressures over the last number of years have resulted in increases in the costs of the testing equipment, supplies and other goods and services that we purchase from manufacturers, suppliers and others.  Inflationary pressures, along with the competition for labor, have also resulted in a rise of our labor costs, which include the costs of compensation, benefits, and recruiting and training new hires.  Our ability to raise the prices and fees we charge for the services we provide is limited.  Continuation of the current inflationary environment may adversely impact us.\n\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS  \n\n    Some statements and disclosures in this document are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “aim,” “endeavor” or “continue.”  These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our plans and expectations, including actual results, to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
