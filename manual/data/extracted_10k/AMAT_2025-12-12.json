      "text": "Item 1:     Business\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. is the leader in the materials engineering solutions used to produce virtually every semiconductor in the world. Semiconductors provide the foundation for advances in technology that are reshaping the global economy, including artificial intelligence, the internet of things, robotics, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy. We are experts in the design, development, production, and servicing of the critical wafer fabrication tools our customers need to manufacture semiconductors. Our customers’ products are used across personal computing devices, mobile phones, artificial intelligence (AI) and data center servers, automobiles, connected devices, industrial applications and consumer electronics. We are well positioned to address the increasing complexity in manufacturing semiconductors, by leveraging the semiconductor capital equipment industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of products to connect and co-optimize our technologies. This enables our customers to evolve their semiconductor technology roadmaps and achieve superior results in their products. \n\nIncorporated in 1967, we are a Delaware corporation. Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October. We operate in two reportable segments: Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services® (AGS). The Semiconductor Systems segment represents the largest contributor to our net revenue. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nSemiconductor Systems \n\nOur Semiconductor Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips, also referred to as integrated circuits (ICs). The Semiconductor Systems segment consists of the semiconductor capital equipment industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of products used in the chip making process. Our products address steps across materials engineering, process control and advanced packaging, including the conversion of patterns into device structures, transistor and interconnect fabrication, metrology, inspection and review, and packaging technologies for connecting finished IC die. In addition to providing equipment for individual process steps, we have the ability to combine, co-optimize and integrate our technologies to develop highly differentiated solutions for our customers. Our equipment helps customers improve the power, performance, yield and costs of semiconductor devices.\n\nOur patterning systems and technologies address challenges resulting from shrinking pattern dimensions and the growing complexity in vertical stacking found in today’s most advanced semiconductor devices. Our transistor and interconnect products and technologies enable continued power and performance improvements of 3D transistors. Our process control systems employ optical and eBeam technologies that allow customers to inspect and review critical semiconductor architectures throughout the manufacturing process, helping improve chip yields. Our advanced packaging systems use our materials engineering expertise to allow customers to connect multiple chips together through heterogeneous integration, enabling them to advance the technology roadmap beyond a single chip, leading to performance and energy-efficiency improvements.\n\nOur Semiconductor Systems sales are to customers that serve the following markets: foundry, logic and other; dynamic random access memory (DRAM); and flash memory (NAND). Foundry, logic, and other is comprised of leading-edge and non-leading edge technology nodes. Leading-edge represents customers that are producing on the most advanced technology nodes, defined as 7 nanometers and smaller. Non-leading edge technology nodes serve markets such as internet of things, communications, automotive, power and sensors.\n\nApplied Global Services\n\nOur AGS segment provides services, spares and factory automation software to customer fabrication plants globally. Through October 26, 2025, our AGS segment also manufactured and sold 200 millimeter (200mm) and other equipment to customers globally that serve non-leading-edge markets. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2026, our 200mm equipment business will be moved to our Semiconductor Systems segment.\n\n AGS’s transactional and subscription service products, spares and factory automation software is purchased by customers to optimize the performance of our large, global installed base of semiconductor and other equipment. These solutions are also used to optimize plant performance and productivity. Customer demand is fulfilled through a global distribution system and trained field engineers located near customer sites to support our semiconductor and other equipment worldwide.\n\nOther\n\nWe also manufacture products and serve customers in certain other industries, including manufacturing equipment for the display industry. The financial results of our businesses that are not included in our Semiconductor Systems segment or our AGS segment, such as our display business, are reported in the Corporate and Other category.\n\nBacklog\n\nWe manufacture systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog consisted of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees.\n\nBacklog by reportable segment as of October 26, 2025 was as follows:\n\n 2025\n\n (In millions, except percentages)\n\nSemiconductor Systems$7,105 47 %\n\nApplied Global Services7,141 48 %\n\nCorporate and Other756 5 %\n\nTotal15,002 100 %\n\nOf the total backlog as of October 26, 2025, approximately 31% is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months.\n\nOur backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods. Our backlog is subject to change, including the addition of new orders, potential amendments or cancellations of existing orders, and changes in export rules and regulations. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\n\nOur worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems. We utilize a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including United States, Singapore, Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, Israel and other countries in Asia and Europe. We use qualified vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts, services and product support. Our supply chain strategy commits to adhere to ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and the Applied Materials Standards of Business Conduct. \n\nAlthough we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts; monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; maintaining appropriate inventories of parts; qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and ensuring quality and performance of parts.\n\nResearch, Development and Engineering\n\nOur long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering solutions, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Our significant investments in RD&E must generally enable us to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. We work closely with our global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements. Our product development and engineering, and process support are performed primarily in the United States, India and Israel. Our customer demonstrations are performed primarily in the United States, China, Taiwan, Israel and South Korea.\n\n6\n\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nBecause of the highly technical nature of our products, we market and sell products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force.\n\nWe have operations in many countries, with some of our business activities concentrated in certain geographic areas. Our business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor and other manufacturers, and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for our products. Customers’ expenditures depend on many factors, including: general economic conditions; anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors and other electronic devices; the development of new technologies; customers’ factory utilization; capital resources and financing; trade policies and export regulations; and government incentives. \n\nInformation on net revenue to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets attributable to our geographic regions is included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2025, two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 15%, respectively, of our net revenue.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Our ability to compete generally depends on our ability to commercialize our technology in a timely manner, continually improve our products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation, productivity, cost-effectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base. The importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists across all the segments of our business. Competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversified companies, which operate in more complex global economic and regulatory environments. We could see increased competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in China resulting from local government incentives and funding as well as export controls established by the United States government to restrict the sale of certain technologies to customers in China. Export controls enacted by the United States government that restrict the sale of certain technologies to customers in China may also provide an advantage to our international competitors. Our ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E, marketing and sales, and global customer support activities. We believe that many of our products have strong competitive positions.\n\nThe competitive environment for each segment is described below.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, robotics and smart vehicles are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors. Our comprehensive portfolio offers a variety of differentiated products, including co-optimized and integrated materials solutions that enable unique films, structures and devices. We must successfully anticipate technology inflections, and our products must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace. We allocate resources among our numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product depending on market requirements. Competitors serving the semiconductor equipment industry range from companies offering a single product line to others offering multiple product lines, and those that serve a single region to global, diversified companies.\n\nThe products and services offered by the AGS segment enhance those of the Semiconductor Systems segment, particularly in markets with demanding global service requirements. Competition in the AGS segment includes a diverse group of third-party service providers as well as customers that choose to perform their own service.\n\nTo compete effectively, we offer products and services to improve system performance, lower overall cost of ownership, and increase yields and productivity of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive factors include cost-effectiveness and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered.\n\n7\n\n\nPatents and Licenses\n\nProtection of our technology assets through enforcement of our intellectual property rights, including patents, is important for our competitive position. Our practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that we consider significant. We have more than 23,500 active patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent, our rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business. In addition to our patents, we possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and copyrights. \n\nWe enter into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in our best interest. We pay royalties under patent license agreements for the use, in some of our products, of certain patented technologies. We also receive royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to our consolidated results of operations.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically address the possibility of patent infringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nGovernmental Regulation\n\nAs a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. These regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, securities, corporate governance, public procurement and public funding, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, cybersecurity, environment (including those related to sustainability and climate), health and safety, employment, immigration and travel regulations, human rights, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. See “Risk Factors – Legal, Compliance and Other Risks – We are exposed to risks related to the global regulatory environment” for further details.\n\nWe are regulated under various international laws regarding the purchase and sale of goods and related items, including but not limited to those related to trade policies and export regulations, and limitations on transfer of intellectual property. See “Risk Factors – Business and Industry Risks – Global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products and services relative to local and global competitors” for further details.\n\nWith respect to environmental, health and safety regulations, we maintain a number of programs that are primarily preventative in nature and regularly monitor ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we have trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental, health, or safety incidents, including, but not limited to, spills, releases, or possible contamination. See also “Risk Factors – Legal, Compliance and Other Risks – We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations” for further details.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and financial results can be and are affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that could increase our tax liability. See “Risk Factors – Operational and Financial Risks – We operate in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws” for further details. For additional discussions regarding the impact of compliance with income tax laws and regulations on our business and operations, see also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations– Results of Operations – Income Taxes” and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n8\n\n\nOur People\n\nOur commitment to innovation begins with the commitment to creating an environment in which our employees can do their best work. Our ability to create differentiated value in the marketplace is driven by the capability of our people to anticipate technology inflections and integrate customer requirements. To achieve this level of value creation, we believe we must continue to attract, hire, develop and retain a world-class global workforce. We invest in our employees by providing quality training and learning opportunities, a compelling career path, building a connected and highly engaged culture, and upholding a high standard of ethics and respect for human rights. \n\nAs of October 26, 2025, we employed approximately 36,500 regular full-time employees spanning 25 countries, of whom approximately 46%, 42% and 12% resided in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe/Middle East, respectively.\n\nConnected and Collaborative Culture\n\nWe value great talent and having employees with a broad mix of perspectives, skills and experiences. We therefore strive to provide fair and equal opportunity for career development and advancement to all our employees and to build a connected and highly engaged culture where all of our employees feel they belong. We seek to cultivate a culture that reflects our values – being the Most Valued Partner, being part of a Winning Team, operating with Responsibility & Integrity, and achieving World Class Performance.\n\nTalent Acquisition and Retention \n\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent upon our continued ability to attract, develop, retain and engage employees. As part of our effort to attract and retain employees, we offer competitive rewards, compensation and benefits, including an Employee Stock Incentive Plan, an Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, adoption credits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance.\n\nEmployee Learning & Development \n\nWe seek to create growth and development opportunities to support an engaged and connected workforce. We promote holistic employee learning and development based on the 70/20/10 model--70% on-the-job learning, 20% social/collaborative and 10% formal training, with a focus on advancing technical skills as well as improving general business acumen to address increasing work complexity. Also, to help expand professional breadth, the segments and functions provide technical and job-specific training tied to their disciplines, while general professional, management, and leadership training is provided at the corporate level. All training is coordinated centrally and aligned with common objectives through Applied Global University. In addition to instructor-led and web-based training, we offer state-of-the-art training modalities, such as AI-based simulations and Augmented and Virtual Reality learning capabilities, to further the development of our new products, train our manufacturing and field support employees, and facilitate remote collaboration.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nWe have historically measured employee engagement through surveys to gain insight into employees’ experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and key drivers for engagement, belonging and overall well-being. During fiscal 2025, we conducted an all-employee survey, which was conducted anonymously through an external partner to encourage maximum participation and elicit candid responses. We also benchmarked the results of that survey against a large and standardized data set involving large technology companies globally. We use the results of employee surveys like the one we conducted in fiscal 2025 and the associated benchmarking data to help us better understand enterprise-wide trends, gauge effectiveness of interventions, and define targeted employee populations (e.g., early tenure employees). Employee survey results are also used to provide leaders and people managers with actionable insights tailored to their own groups that can further enhance employee engagement and collaboration. These actionable insights are then integrated with the people strategy process and cadence within Applied.\n\nAdditional information regarding our activities related to our people and sustainability, can be found in our latest Impact Report, which is located on our website at https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/corporate-responsibility.html.

      "text": "Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A:      Risk Factors\n\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.\n\nBusiness and Industry Risks\n\nThe industries we serve can be volatile and difficult to predict.\n\nThe industries in which we operate, including the global semiconductor industry, have historically been cyclical and are subject to volatility in customer demand. Demand for our products and services is impacted by technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices, end-user demand, the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, business and consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) and technologies related to AI are a significant demand driver for the industries we serve. AI is evolving rapidly and the expected timing and amount of investments related to AI can change significantly. As a result, it is difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products related to AI. Changes in demand can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can significantly impact our operating results. The amount and mix of our customers’ capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can also significantly impact our operating results.\n\nTo meet rapidly changing demand, we must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage our resources, investments, production capacity, supply chain, workforce, inventory and other components of our business. We may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our business operations with changes in demand. If we do not effectively manage these challenges, our business performance and operating results may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, our gross and operating margins, cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted during periods of changing demand.\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\n\nOur business and the industries in which we operate can be impacted by uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, inflation and changes in interest rates, bank failures, tariffs and trade policies and economic recession. These conditions have caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to delay, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services, reduce our backlog and increase our inventory. Customers may also scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy, which can reduce our revenue and result in additional inventory or bad debt expense. Other equipment manufacturers may also consolidate or form strategic alliances, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.\n\nThese conditions make it more difficult to accurately forecast operating and financial results and make business and investment decisions. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely impact our ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower demand, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support our customers. The consequences of these conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur investment portfolio is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by rising inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures or economic recession and the value and liquidity of our portfolio and returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. We also maintain cash balances in various bank accounts globally and if any of these financial institutions become insolvent, it could limit our ability to access our cash and affect our ability to manage our operations.\n\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\n\nWe have product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. In fiscal 2025, approximately 89% of our net revenue was to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of our operations, we are subject to a number of factors that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include global political and social conditions, such as policies or regulations within countries, including in China, the United States and countries in Europe and Asia, that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors to us, or regarding national, commercial or security issues. Other factors include geopolitical turmoil, acts of war or social unrest; our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls in our geographically diverse operations; delays or restrictions \n\non personnel travel and in shipping materials or products; our ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments; performance of our geographically diverse third-party providers; impacts of regional or global health epidemics, natural disasters and extreme and chronic weather events; fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates; as well as other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on our business and manufacturing operations or demand for our products and services, and our performance and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nGlobal trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products and services relative to local and global competitors.\n\nA majority of our products and services are delivered to customers in jurisdictions outside of the United States, including China, Taiwan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic and national security factors can lead to global trade restrictions and changes in trade policies and export regulations that affect the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods and could significantly increase or impose new tariffs on a broad array of goods. Trade restrictions and export regulations, or increased or new tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in semiconductor equipment, increase our supply chain complexity and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or restrict our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nFor example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. Over the past several years, the U.S. government announced additional export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, with disparate impact on companies in different jurisdictions, which have limited the market for certain of our products and services, adversely impacted our revenues and increased our exposure to foreign and Chinese domestic competition. The U.S. Department of Commerce expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products or provide certain services to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions for exports of certain items to China, added certain Chinese companies to its “Entity List,” making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to China of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. These regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in China. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult and time-consuming, and there is no assurance we will be issued licenses on a timely basis or at all. Our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our sales in China, may cause us to be displaced by foreign and Chinese domestic companies and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these complex rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government are uncertain and evolving and may make it more challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results. The U.S. and other governments may promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting our ability to provide certain products and services to customers outside the U.S., including China. The U.S. government may also revise or expand existing requirements or issue guidance clarifying the scope and application of these requirements, which could change the impact of these rules on our business and manufacturing operations. The U.S. government may also continue to add customers to its “Entity List,” promulgate additional restrictions, or take measures that could disrupt our product shipments or the provision of services to certain customers. These and other potential future regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nAs a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, from time to time we may receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between us and certain foreign entities. For example, since 2022, we have received multiple subpoenas from government authorities requesting information relating to certain China customer shipments and export controls compliance, including from the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We are cooperating fully with the U.S. government in these matters. We have continued to receive related subpoenas, as well as requests for information, and may in the future receive additional related subpoenas and requests for information from such or other government authorities. Any such inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. Any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which we or our employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on our business and damage to our global brand and reputation, and could have a material and adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of sensitive data or intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of our business.\n\nWe are exposed to risks and uncertainty related to changes in trade policies, and increased tariffs and trade disputes. \n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by uncertainty and changes in trade policies, including tariffs, and trade disputes between the United States and other countries. The United States has announced changes to its trade policy, including increased tariffs on imports. These actions have caused substantial uncertainty and have resulted in retaliatory measures, including new tariffs on U.S. goods imposed by China and other countries. Some of these actions have been followed by announcements of limited exemptions and temporary pauses and trade frameworks with certain countries. \n\nA significant number of our customers and suppliers are located outside of the United States. Increases in tariffs increase our costs and can negatively impact our margins and reduce the competitiveness of our products due to the increase in the cost of importing materials, parts and components used in manufacturing our products. Tariffs can also increase supply chain complexity and may make it more difficult to purchase necessary equipment and supplies to manufacture our products. Increases in tariffs, including reciprocal and sector-based tariffs, also increase the cost to our customers of importing our products, which could harm customer demand for our products. Uncertainty or volatility with respect to tariffs and trade disputes may also make it difficult for us and our customers and suppliers to make and execute business and capital equipment investment plans; lead to global or regional inflation and economic recession and reduce demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices; cause our customers to delay or cancel orders or negatively impact our competitive position; impede our ability to purchase materials, including critical materials and minerals, and disrupt supply chain and logistics. For example, in 2025 the Chinese government implemented export controls on the export of rare earth minerals that are used in certain of our products and may implement additional controls in the future. We may take actions to mitigate the impact of increases in tariffs and changes in trade policies, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful, and any such actions could result in additional costs, manufacturing delays or other difficulties, as well as additional risks, and may not be effective. Any or all of these factors may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.\n\nA relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer have exposed and can further expose our business and operating results to greater volatility. Our customer base is geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea, and export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in China, have exposed and can further expose our business and operating results to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of our customer base could shift over time as a result of changes in technology and competitive landscape, as well as government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly over time and may continue to have a significant impact on our operating results. Our products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business, which may have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of our customer base increases our risks related to the financial condition of our customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent our customers experience liquidity constraints, we may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on our results of operations. Major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a negative impact on our business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.\n\nSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.\n\nOur business depends on our timely supply of products and services to meet the changing requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Volatility in demand for our products and worldwide demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices can impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and has in the past resulted in a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture our products. These shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand. Supply chain constraints may increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, which may lead to reduced demand for our products. Supply chain disruptions have in the past caused, and may from time to time cause, delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can lead to our business \n\n13\n\n\nperformance becoming significantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery schedules.\n\nWe may further experience supply chain disruptions, significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for our products as a result of:\n\n•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, international trade disputes, particularly those relating to exports of certain technologies to China, where a significant portion of our supply chain is located, and any retaliatory measures, that adversely impact us or our direct or sub-tier suppliers;\n\n•political instability, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil in locations where we or our customers or suppliers have operations;\n\n•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain quality parts on a cost-effective basis;\n\n•cybersecurity incidents affecting our supply chain;\n\n•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions, as well as uncertainties arising from the imposition of tariffs and any retaliatory measures;\n\n•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals;\n\n•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;\n\n•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;\n\n•limited availability of critical materials and minerals, including due to Chinese government restrictions on the export of certain rare earth minerals implemented in 2025, which could be expanded in the future, and limited feasible alternatives to materials subject to existing or proposed regulations to limit their use (such as hydrofluorocarbons and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials supplied to us or used in the manufacturing or operations of our products; and\n\n•impacts of natural disasters, extreme and chronic weather events, regional or global health epidemics, or other events beyond our control.\n\nIf a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection or other performance factors, or does not meet regulatory requirements applicable to our supply chain, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and impair our ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of our intellectual property rights and the intellectual property rights of our customers and other third parties. \n\nIf we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations and negatively impact our working capital. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or the inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\n\nAny of these events impacting our supply chain could affect our ability to meet our customers’ demand, result in higher costs to us and have an adverse effect on customer relationships and our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are exposed to various factors that impact the industries in which we operate, including factors specific to the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are characterized by factors that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services and our operating results. The largest proportion of our net revenue and profitability is derived from our Semiconductor Systems segment’s sale of a wide range of equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips, and a majority of the revenue of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The industries in which we operate, including the semiconductor industry, are characterized by factors particular to these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services, including:\n\n•changes in demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic or geopolitical conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products;\n\n•the frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and our ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;\n\n14\n\n\n•the cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;\n\n•the need to reduce product development time and meet technical challenges;\n\n•the number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications;\n\n•capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;\n\n•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives impacting customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants and semiconductor research and development;\n\n•the cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, and the impact on investment in capital equipment;\n\n•semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that we do not serve, such as lithography, or segments where our products have lower relative market presence;\n\n•delays in installation of our equipment delivered to customers;\n\n•changes in growth rates among the semiconductor and other industries in which we operate;\n\n•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;\n\n•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;\n\n•the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;\n\n•system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;\n\n•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;\n\n•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including total cost of manufacturing system ownership and other challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;\n\n•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among semiconductor equipment suppliers;\n\n•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of our foundry customers;\n\n•the fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; \n\n•the importance of specialty markets (such as internet of things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use process technologies that have a low barrier to entry; \n\n•the increasing role for and complexity of software in our products;\n\n•the focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations, and the availability of adequate and reliable sources of energy; and\n\n•the importance of advanced packaging to AI computing. \n\nIf we do not effectively address these factors, accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies, commercialization of our products and services, and our ability to increase our position in our current markets and expand into adjacent and new markets. The development, introduction and \n\n15\n\n\nsupport of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment requires collaboration with customers and other industry participants, which has grown more complex and expensive over time. New or improved products may entail higher costs and longer development cycles, and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, we must:\n\n•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;\n\n•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;\n\n•complete our new Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization Center and other major infrastructure projects on schedule and on budget, and realize the anticipated benefits of those projects;\n\n•differentiate our products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, and successfully commercialize our products and achieve market acceptance;\n\n•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications and customer requirements;\n\n•enhance our worldwide operations across our businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;\n\n•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;\n\n•effectively allocate resources between our existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;\n\n•improve the productivity of capital invested in research and development activities;\n\n•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for our products, improve our manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings; and\n\n•implement changes in our design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time and improve product life cycle management.\n\nIf we do not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, our business performance and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\nWe are exposed to risks related to government incentives and other agreements that may involve government entities.\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements with government entities for grants, tax benefits and other incentives, other funding related to our investment, research and development and production activities or for sale of our products to government entities or government-funded programs. These agreements typically include terms that are not common in similar agreements with non-governmental entities, including representations and warranties, covenants and certifications, and record-keeping, accounting, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, information handling, supply chain management, headcount, security, disclosure and other requirements. These agreements may also require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending and performance milestones. Compliance with these requirements may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs, and a failure to comply could result in cancelation of agreements or transactions, investigations, civil and criminal penalties, forfeiture of profits, reduction, termination or clawback of any funding, suspension or debarment from doing business with the government, or other penalties, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are exposed to factors specific to the display industry.\n\nWe are a supplier to the global display industry, which has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, the speed of adopting new technologies and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. Demand for and the profitability of our display products and services is impacted by the foregoing industry factors, as well as the introduction of and rate of transition to new types of display technologies, our ability to anticipate and adapt to technology transitions and inflections, and the expansion of display manufacturing facilities in China. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display fabrication equipment and technologies does not grow, our business and our operating results may be adversely impacted.\n\n16\n\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we seek to continue to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with our existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Our ability to successfully expand our business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;\n\n•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies and to develop relationships with new customers;\n\n•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;\n\n•our ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities and avoid or minimize risks;\n\n•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;\n\n•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;\n\n•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;\n\n•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;\n\n•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where we do not have, or have limited, operations;\n\n•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;\n\n•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;\n\n•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and\n\n•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.\n\nWe are exposed to risks related to the use of AI by us and our competitors. \n\nWe are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into the development of technologies, our business operations and our products and services. AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving and may subject us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks. The implementation of AI can be costly, and there is no guarantee that our use of AI will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are preferred by our customers. Our competitors may be more successful in their AI strategy and develop superior products and services with the aid of AI technology. Additionally, AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in outputs. This may give rise to legal liability, damage our reputation, and materially harm our business. The use of AI in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as subject us to risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity. We also utilize third-party providers of AI capabilities, and our ability to implement AI successfully in our business operations relies on our continued access to third-party providers and safeguards implemented by them. Additionally, AI technology may also create ethical issues, which could impair market adoption of such technology and impair demand for our products and services. Furthermore, the United States and other countries may adopt laws and regulations related to AI. These laws and regulations could cause us to incur greater compliance costs and limit the use of AI in the development of our products and services. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these regulatory requirements could subject us to legal liabilities, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material and adverse impact on our business.\n\nOperational and Financial Risks\n\nWe are exposed to risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\nOur success depends on the protection of our technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, such as the manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts that use our technology without authorization, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Detecting and preventing misuse of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that our protective measures will be successful. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks and uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. Enforcement efforts may be subject to claims that our rights are invalid or unenforceable and may result in counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. If we are unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete, invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it \n\n17\n\n\ncould have an adverse impact on our competitive position and business. Changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by our intellectual property assets.\n\nFrom time to time third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, intellectual property claims against us and our products. Claims that our products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on our business. We may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any of these incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products, all of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store and otherwise process data using information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by us or our third-party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to us or our customers or other business partners, and personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruptions, outages, failures and security breaches or incidents, which may be caused by a variety of internal and external factors. We and our third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents may range from physical attacks on our computer system or network infrastructure, to employee or contractor error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or confidential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, or advanced persistent threats, any of which may target or impact us directly or indirectly through our third-party providers and global supply chain. Threat actors may also attempt to influence employees, suppliers and other third-party providers, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our, our customers’ or business partners’ data. Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or at times supported by state actors. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, tension with China and conflict in the Middle East may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. The techniques used by threat actors to identify vulnerabilities and craft cybersecurity attacks change frequently and may increasingly involve the use of new technologies, including AI and quantum computing. AI and deepfake technologies could be used to attack information systems by creating more effective phishing emails or social engineering and by exploiting vulnerabilities in electronic security programs utilizing false image or voice recognition. Vulnerabilities, technical errors and other risks may be introduced through the use of AI by us, our customers, suppliers and other business partners and third-party providers, or through the use of third-party hardware and software. Advances in quantum computing have the potential to undermine current encryption standards and may allow threat actors to circumvent existing protective measures. Although we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents impacting our information systems that have been determined to have a material impact on us to date, we continue to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future. We may be unable to anticipate, prevent or remediate future incidents, and in some instances, we may be unaware of incidents or their magnitude and effects, particularly as attackers are increasingly able to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. Cybersecurity incidents, including incidents on third-party provider networks, may result in business disruption; delay in the development and delivery of our products; disruption of our manufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and reporting financial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of our company and our third-party providers and customers); reputational damage; private claims, demands, and litigation or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, or other proceedings related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against and recover from these incidents. Our efforts to comply with and changes to laws, regulations and contractual and other actual and asserted obligations concerning privacy, cybersecurity and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer and data localization, could result in significant expense, and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in inquiries, investigations and other proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality and intellectual property, which may increase our overall compliance burden.\n\n18\n\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.\n\nWe may engage in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including:\n\n•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, including through expanding global national security regimes that impose prohibitions on foreign investments in or acquisitions of local businesses; litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;\n\n•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;\n\n•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;\n\n•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, including post-closing investigations of non-notified transactions, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;\n\n•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;\n\n•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;\n\n•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\n•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from our existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;\n\n•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;\n\n•the impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;\n\n•changes in our credit rating, which could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital;\n\n•increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;\n\n•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we have not historically conducted business;\n\n•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;\n\n•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;\n\n•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, trade control processes or programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource or other policies or practices;\n\n•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;\n\n•the risk of litigation, government enforcement actions or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\n•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities, including potential intellectual property infringement claims, or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and\n\n•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.\n\nWe make investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. We may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. The risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions, and as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.\n\nWe may seek to divest portions of our business that are not deemed to fit with our strategic plan. Divestitures involve additional risks and uncertainties, such as our ability to sell these businesses at a price and on terms that are satisfactory and in a \n\n19\n\n\ntimely manner or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions or other strategic projects or initiatives, loss of key employees or customers, loss of access by retained business units to critical intellectual property or other assets transferred with the divested business, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following these divestitures and other adverse financial impacts.\n\nThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, ongoing competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, challenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries, the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, our career growth and development opportunities and our employment policies. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The loss of knowledgeable and experienced employees may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.\n\nWe operate in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates and valuation of deferred tax assets. \n\nThere have been a number of enacted and proposed changes in the tax laws that could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. An increase in our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, various countries where we do business have enacted or plan to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax regimes based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and where enacted, the rules began to be effective in fiscal 2025. Additionally, on July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Key tax provisions of the OBBBA are designed to accelerate tax deductions, but that may have a detrimental impact on our ability to use certain deferred tax assets. For example, as a result of the acceleration of certain tax deductions under the OBBBA, we are unable to forecast utilization of our existing corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) credit deferred tax asset. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against the CAMT credit deferred tax asset, which increased our effective tax rate and provision for income taxes in fiscal 2025. The amount of the valuation allowance may be adjusted in future quarters if estimates of our future taxable income change. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate the impact, if any, of enacted and proposed changes in the tax laws on our results of operations and cash flows. The adoption and effective dates of changes in the tax laws vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in future years.\n\nWe have been granted additional conditional reduced tax rates in Singapore that expire beginning in fiscal 2030. There is risk our conditional reduced tax rates may not be renewed.\n\nConsistent with the international nature of our business, we conduct certain manufacturing, supply chain and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In some foreign jurisdictions, we must meet certain requirements to continue to qualify for tax incentives. There is no assurance we will be able to meet such requirements in the future to fully realize benefits from these incentives. Furthermore, the proposed plans to implement global minimum tax regimes could reduce or eliminate the benefits of our tax incentives.\n\nWe are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amend previously filed tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. We may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.\n\nOur indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect our financial condition and business.\n\nAs of October 26, 2025, we had $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, we may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to \n\n20\n\n\n101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if we experience a change of control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. We also have in place revolving credit facilities that allow us to borrow up to an aggregate amount of approximately $4.1 billion. While no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities as of October 26, 2025, we may borrow amounts in the future under these credit facilities or enter into new financing arrangements. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations is dependent upon the results of our business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. If we fail to satisfy our debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, we may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may constitute a default under our other obligations. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Significant changes in our credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets, or incurrence of new or refinancing of existing indebtedness at higher interest rates could have a material and adverse impact on our access to and cost of capital for future financings and our financial condition. \n\nOur business depends on the successful implementation and proper functioning of information systems we use. \n\nOur business depends on certain information systems, including, enterprise resource planning, product research and development, financial reporting, information technology network management and telecommunications. These systems may be maintained by us or by our third-party vendors. Failures of these systems could disrupt our operations, impede our ability to timely and accurately process and report financial results, and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe periodically implement new or enhanced information systems. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. If the implementation or improvement of information systems is delayed or unsuccessful, we may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.\n\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of our common stock, changes in our strategies or product portfolio and restructuring activities. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. We have recorded charges to earnings, and may in the future be required to record charges to earnings, when impairments of goodwill or intangible assets have been determined to exist.\n\nWe may not continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares.\n\nOur ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. Future dividends and share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, our cash flow; potential future capital requirements for investments, acquisitions, infrastructure projects and research and development; changes in applicable tax, corporate, or other laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\n\nLegal, Compliance and Other Risks\n\nWe are exposed to risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.\n\nFrom time to time we are, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, other intellectual property rights, trade compliance, including import, export and customs, antitrust, anti-corruption, compliance with government contracting requirements, environmental regulations, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety and other matters. We may receive, and have received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection with government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by our company or our employees. For example, we have received subpoenas from government authorities requesting \n\n21\n\n\ninformation relating to China customer shipments, export controls compliance, certain federal award applications and information submitted to the federal government. We also on occasion receive notifications from customers who believe we owe them indemnification, product warranty or have other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.\n\nLegal proceedings, claims and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and our other resources; constrain our ability to sell our products and services; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect our business. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.\n\nWe are exposed to risks related to the global regulatory environment.\n\nWe are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, securities, corporate governance, public procurement and public funding, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs regulations), antitrust, cybersecurity, environment, health and safety, employment, immigration and travel regulations, human rights, privacy, data protection and localization and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention and otherwise adversely impact our business operations. Violations of these law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on our business, and damage to our reputation, and could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nImplementation and reporting on our sustainability strategies and targets could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.\n\nWe periodically communicate our strategies and targets related to sustainability matters. These strategies and targets, and their underlying assumptions, reflect our current plans and aspirations, and we may be unable to achieve them. Changing customer and shareholder sustainability expectations, including increasing customer demand for sustainable products, and regulatory requirements, as well as actions taken to achieve our sustainability targets, could cause us to incur substantial expense and alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment designs and processes. Any failure or perceived failure to timely meet these sustainability requirements, expectations or targets, or a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of planned investments and technology innovations related to sustainability, could adversely impact the demand for our products and subject us to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time and may result in inconsistent data, increase our costs, result in significant revisions to our strategies and targets or impact our ability to achieve them. We also are or may become subject to new climate and sustainability laws and regulations, such as the State of California’s climate change disclosure rules, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and International Sustainability Standards Board standards. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as increased scrutiny from regulators, customers and other stakeholders on our sustainability practices, could result in additional costs and expose us to new risks. Any scrutiny of our greenhouse gas emissions or other sustainability disclosures, our failure to achieve related strategies and targets, or our failure to disclose our sustainability measures consistent with applicable laws and regulations or to the satisfaction of regulators or our stakeholders could negatively impact our reputation or performance.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.\n\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the design, manufacture, sale, shipping, import, export and use of our products; use, handling, discharge, recycling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials used in our products or in producing our products; the operation of our facilities; and the use of our real property, including in connection with construction of our infrastructure projects. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping, import, export or use of certain of our products; limitations on the operation of our facilities or ability to use our real property; and a decrease in the value of our real property. We could be required to alter our product design, manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations, including reporting requirements. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n22\n\n\nItem 1B:      Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C:     Cybersecurity\n\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nWe have implemented processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our cybersecurity risk management program. This program includes processes for continuous cybersecurity risk and advanced persistent cybersecurity threat monitoring; cybersecurity attack, vulnerability and cloud security management; and penetration testing. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation protocols; cybersecurity and data protection policies and training to our employees; a supply chain cybersecurity program to increase awareness, assess supplier security controls, help improve supplier security controls and manage security incidents; a program to protect company, customer and supplier intellectual property by operationalizing strategy, policy and awareness; a privacy and data protection program to keep pace with rapidly evolving global data laws and regulations as well as emerging technologies; engagement of third-party auditors to help assure the effectiveness of internal controls, including cybersecurity controls; and partnership with industry groups, government agencies and third-party experts in an effort to continuously improve our cybersecurity risk management program. We conduct assessments based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity (NIST) Framework to evaluate our program, and we engage third-parties for assistance and to independently assess, proactively monitor and provide an external view of our cybersecurity program. We conduct risk assessments and tabletop exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats, including threats associated with our use of third-party service providers, and to identify areas for improvements. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated with our enterprise risk management (ERM) program, and information about cybersecurity risks and our cybersecurity risk management program is reviewed as part of our ERM program, sharing common risk governance and reporting processes that apply across our ERM program.\n\nWhile we are not aware of having directly experienced a cybersecurity incident that has materially impacted our business, financial condition or results of operations, we face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could reasonably likely materially affect us, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Operational and Financial Risks – We are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents” for additional information about cybersecurity related risks.\n\nGovernance \n\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the assessment of major risks facing us, and its Audit Committee oversees our ERM program, including oversight of cybersecurity risks and of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity risk management program, and our management regularly updates the Chair of the Audit Committee regarding cybersecurity incidents where appropriate in accordance with our cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation protocols. The Audit Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity, and management reports to the full Board on our cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity risk management program at least annually. \n\nOur management has day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including implementing risk mitigation plans, processes and controls, and managing our cybersecurity risk management program. Our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who has extensive experience in cybersecurity and information security management, is primarily responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk management program, cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation protocols, and reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee and at least annually to the full Board on our cybersecurity, data and intellectual property security programs, policies, risks and controls. The CISO reports to our Chief Information Officer, who is responsible for administering secure and scalable security infrastructure and reports to our Chief Digital Officer, each of whom has extensive experience in information technology. \n\nOur management team’s efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents are informed by reviews with our information technology security teams, receipt of threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, periodic assessments against the NIST Framework and through alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our information technology environment.",
