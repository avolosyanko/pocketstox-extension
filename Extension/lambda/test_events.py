                "Donald Trump stunned global investors on Wednesday as he announced a 90-day pause in "
                "additional tariffs on countries that were willing to negotiate with the US, sending stocks "
                "surging as the president backed down from a full-blown trade war. Wall Street equities soared "
                "immediately after Trump's announcement, with the blue-chip S&P 500 closing up 9.5 per cent and "
                "the Nasdaq Composite surging more than 12 per cent. It was the best day for the S&P 500 since "
                "2008 and the strongest for the Nasdaq since 2001. The massive rally in Wall Street stocks added "
                "about $4.3tn to the market value of the S&P 500, according to Financial Times calculations based "
                "on FactSet data. The gains helped reverse the heavy losses posted for US stocks since Trump "
                "announced his wide-ranging tariffs a week ago. However, Trump also singled out China for further "
                "tariffs, increasing his additional levies on the world's second-largest economy to 125 per cent, "
                'deepening his trade stand-off with the Asian nation. "Based on the fact that more than 75 '
                "Countries have called . . . to negotiate a solution . . . and that these Countries have not, at "
                "my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have "
                "authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of "
                '10%, also effective immediately," Trump said in a Truth Social post. But China had showed a '
                '"lack of respect" by retaliating against US tariffs, Trump added. "I am hereby raising the '
                'Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately." The '
                "stunning climbdown from the US leader came after a week of turmoil in global markets, with "
                "trillions of dollars shed in equity prices around the world, a sharp sell-off in US bonds, and a "
                "plunge in oil prices to levels last seen during the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is Trump's "
                'capitulation to markets," said Andy Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. "He has saved face by '
                'keeping tariffs on China." Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said the "world is ready" to work '
                'with Trump to "fix global trade" but dismissed China as having "chosen the opposite direction", '
                "as markets jumped in response to the US president's announcement on Wednesday. The commerce "
                'secretary added on X that he and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent "sat with the President while '
                'he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency". Later on Wednesday, Trump '
                'appeared to acknowledge some of the fear in the markets sparked by his trade war. "Well, I '
                "thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, "
                "they were getting . . . a little bit afraid,\" he told reporters. Wednesday's market rally after "
                'Trump backed away from many of his tariffs made it "the biggest day in financial history", he '
                "said. Wall Street banks had warned that the levies would send the US economy into recession while "
                "boosting inflation and unemployment. Just before Trump's shock announcement on Wednesday, Goldman "
                "Sachs issued a report predicting a recession in the US economy triggered by the president's trade "
                "war. Just over two hours later the bank rescinded its prediction. Companies that had been beaten "
                "down in recent days posted huge gains on Wednesday after Trump's climbdown. Apple, Nvidia, "
                "Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Tesla all jumped at least 10 per cent following Trump's announcement."
                "\"To the extent that tariffs are not put into force, that's a good thing from an economic "
                "perspective. To the extent that the trade war becomes just between the US and China, that eases "
                'pressure on other countries and on the global economy," said Eric Winograd at AllianceBernstein.'
                "The climbdown ushers in a phase of what are expected to be multiple, parallel trade negotiations "
                "between the US and its top trading partners over the coming weeks to try to resolve commercial "
                "tensions."
                "Bessent on Tuesday announced he would lead talks with Japan, alongside Trump's top trade "
                "negotiator, Jamieson Greer, in an effort to strike a deal that could see tariffs lowered."
                "The move came after days of mixed messages from Trump administration officials over how durable "
                "the tariffs would be and whether the US was open to talks with its trading partners that could "
                "see them lowered. Greer was giving testimony in front of the House of Representatives' ways and "
                "means committee when Trump announced his pause."
                '"WTF, who\'s in charge?" Steven Horsford, the Democratic lawmaker from Nevada, shouted at '
                "Greer moments after Trump announced the pause."
                "Horsford asked Greer if he was aware that the president had just paused his tariffs. Greer "
                'replied that he had been aware the proposal had been "under discussion".'
                "But even as Trump pauses his plans for aggressively higher tariff rates on many countries "
                "except China, he is still maintaining the 10 per cent blanket levy on most imports from around "
                "the world that took effect on April 5."
