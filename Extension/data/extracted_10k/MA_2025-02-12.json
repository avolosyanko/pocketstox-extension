Business\nOverview\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions. These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data. Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nFor a full discussion of our business, please see page 10.\nOur Performance\nThe following are our key financial and operational highlights for 2024, including growth rates over the prior year:\n\nGAAP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nNet revenue                                                                                     Net income                                                                                               Diluted EPS                                  \n$28.2B                                                                                          $12.9B                                                                                                   $13.89                                       \nup 12%                                                                                          up 15%                                                                                                   up 17%                                       \nNon-GAAP 1 (currency-neutral)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nAdjusted net revenue                                                                            Adjusted net income                                                                                      Adjusted diluted EPS                         \n$28.2B                                                                                          $13.5B                                                                                                   $14.60                                       \nup 13%                                                                                          up 18%                                                                                                   up 21%                                       \n$13.4B                                                                                          $11.0B            Repurchased shares                                                                     $14.8B                                       \nin capital returned                                                                             $2.4B             Dividends paid                                                                         cash flows                                   \nto stockholders                                                                                                                                                                                          from operations                              \n                  Gross dollar volume(growth on a local currency basis)                                           Cross-border volume growth (on a local currency basis)                                                   Switched transactions      \n$9.8T                                                                                           up 18%                                                                                                   159.4B                                       \nup 11%                                                                                                                                                                           up 11%               \n1Non-GAAP results (including growth rates) exclude the impact of gains and losses on equity investments, Special Items and/or foreign currency.

BUSINESS\n\nOur Strategic Priorities\nConsumer payments.  We focus on enabling consumer payments, providing consumers with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments and account-based transactions), while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless. We do so by:\n•Capturing the significant secular opportunity of cash displacement by increasing acceptance through advancing technology and partnering with players across the payments ecosystem, as well as by opening up closed-loop and domestic networks. We also pursue incremental volume and transactions by extending our reach across under-penetrated card verticals (such as bill pay) and real-time account-based payments\n•Driving brand preference through compelling consumer experiences by offering relevant value propositions to consumers (including features, benefits and experiences), providing comprehensive digital functionality (such as Digital First), delivering enhanced security and functionality (increasing tokenization, scaling authentication and streamlining online checkout) and driving increased approval, spend and activation rates\n•Investing in the future and driving market transformation by extending the reach of our network to enable the tokenization of credentials, identities, assets and data and the exchange of those items between counterparties (providing security, privacy and control). We also seek to achieve this transformation by modernizing our card switch to meet evolving needs \nCommercial and new payment flows. We focus on capturing opportunities in commercial payments (both point-of-sale purchases and invoiced payments) and disbursements and remittances (specifically, through Mastercard Move, our collection of money movement capabilities that provides solutions for money transfers to consumers from consumers, businesses or governments). We do so by:\n•Accelerating secular shift in commercial point-of-sale purchases by offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms (both corporate and small business solutions, including expense management, reporting, reconciliation and data insights); expanding distribution of our point-of-sale offerings across financial institutions, new geographies, new channels and small businesses; and growing acceptance\n•Capturing commercial invoiced payments by driving engagement across buyers and suppliers to, among other things, simplify workflows, release working capital and improve data reconciliation to reduce end-to-end costs; building on our travel offerings to expand into additional select verticals (including business-to-business (“B2B”) marketplaces, trade and logistics, healthcare, consumer packaged goods and pharmaceuticals); and embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows \n•Modernizing disbursements and remittances by utilizing Mastercard Move to scale use cases across senders (including consumers, businesses and governments) and receiving consumers (both domestic and cross-border) and expand money movement across our global network of financial institution partners\nServices and other solutions. Our services and other solutions, which are interdependent with our payment network, drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. We offer security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement, business and market insights, gateway, processing and open banking, among other services and solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based payments and solutions). As we drive value, our services and other solutions generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance. We do so by:\n•Differentiating our payments capabilities by combining our wide range of services and solutions in various ways to meet the needs and priorities of our partners, which helps drive market wins and payments growth \n•Enhancing and expanding our suite of services to better serve our existing customers, including across new buying centers and new capability areas, as well as to reach new customers \n•Scaling distribution by using our technology platforms to enable us to switch more transactions and deliver more services per transaction, selling directly to customers through a dedicated sales force and global account teams, and embedding services with partners (such as tech platforms, system integrators, processors and other networks) to deliver those services at scale\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nOur priorities are fundamentally interdependent and strengthen, reinforce and complement each other. \n\n•Our payments network helps us scale our services and solutions, and those services and solutions help us differentiate our payments solutions•We grow in payments, which allows us to switch more transactions and bring more transaction data onto the network•We use that data to create insightful services and solutions that can, in turn, help us win new and renewed customer deals and drive greater payments volume growth      \nEnabling Our Success\nThese priorities are supported by six enablers:\nPeople. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people. We attract, develop and retain top talent, in alignment with our strategic priorities. Our winning culture is guided by the Mastercard Way, which outlines the behaviors we expect from employees to deliver for our customers and one another. We foster a working environment that benefits and provides equal opportunities for all of our employees, where people have opportunities to perform purpose-driven work that advances our business objectives by delivering a positive impact on communities, customers and co-workers across the globe.\nBrand. Our brands and brand identities serve as a differentiator for our business, representing our values and enabling us to accelerate growth in new areas. \nData and AI. We create a range of products and services for our customers using our data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) assets, technology, platforms and expertise. We follow our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data and privacy. \nTechnology.  Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers. It unlocks broader reach to scale digital payment services to multiple channels. Utilizing our technology standards, services and governance model, we connect financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others, enabling interoperability and allowing consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.\nFranchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders who participate in our global payments network. Our franchise model creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We provide a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation and safety and security of our network. Our franchise model enables the scale of our network and provides a single governance structure for its operation. This structure has the potential to be extended to new opportunities. \nDoing Well by Doing Good. Sustainable impact is fundamental to our business strategy. We leverage our employees, technology, resources, partnerships and expertise to address social, economic and environmental challenges, while at the same time creating markets for future growth and driving long-term value for stockholders. Our environmental, social and governance priorities are expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all of the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles. For more information, please reference our most recently published Environmental, Social and Governance Report located on our website. \n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1.

This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure means for making and receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. We enable transactions for our customers through our payment network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 220 countries and territories. \nPayment Network Transactions. Our payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution). \nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers. \nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our payment network and our role in that transaction, which includes services and other solutions and payments ecosystem security:\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.\n•Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved customer experience. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n•Additional Four-Party System Fees.  The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit. \nSwitched Transactions \n•Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.\n\n•Cross-Border and Domestic. Our payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”). We switch approximately 70% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.

Mastercard-branded cards are now accepted for both domestic and cross-border purchases.                       \nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to help ensure the integrity of our payment network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\nPayment Network Architecture.  Our payment network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple services (such as fraud scoring, tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real time. This architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time.\nAccount-Based Payments Capabilities\nWe offer ACH batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for ACH transactions between bank accounts in real-time. Our real-time account-based payments capabilities provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities. We build, implement, enhance and operate real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. We operate real-time payments infrastructure in several countries around the world. We also use our real-time account-based payments capabilities to enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. \nWe discuss below under “Our Payment Products and Applications” the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based payments capabilities to capture new payment flows. \nSecurity and Franchise\nPayments Ecosystem Security.  We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem, including a robust program designed to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We work with experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers.\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nAs another feature of our multi-layered approach, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry associations to develop and put in place technical standards for safe and secure transactions, and we provide solutions and products that are designed to help provide safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. Our approach includes supporting small businesses by sharing best practices and providing access to free utilities and services, benefiting both them and the entire payments ecosystem. We discuss specific security solutions that we offer to our customers below under “Services and Other Solutions”. \nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our global payments network, setting standards and rules for all participants and aiming to ensure interoperability among them while balancing risk and value across all stakeholders. Our franchise model achieves this by creating and sustaining a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. Through our franchise model, we work to ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants may benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this goal through the following key activities: \n•Participant Onboarding. We determine that each new customer meets the necessary prerequisites to use and contribute to our network by defining clear ecosystem roles and responsibilities for their operations\n•Operating Standards. We define the technical, operational and financial standards that all network participants are required to uphold\n•Safety and Security. We establish central principles, including safeguarding consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network \n•Responsible Stewardship. We set performance standards to support ecosystem optimization and growth and use proactive monitoring designed to both ensure participant adherence to operating standards and protect the integrity of the ecosystem\n•Issue Resolution. We operate a framework to address disputes between our network participants\nOur Payment Products and Applications \n\nConsumer Payments We provide a wide variety of products and services that support payment products that customers can offer to consumers and merchants. These offerings facilitate transactions across our payments network and platforms among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, digital partners, businesses, governments and other organizations in markets globally.

We support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash from bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale. Our branded debit programs consist of Mastercard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (our PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution).\nPrepaid.  Prepaid accounts are a type of electronic payment that enables consumers to pay from pre-funded accounts whether or not they previously had a bank account or a credit history. These accounts can be tailored to meet specific program, customer or consumer needs, such as paying bills, sending person-to-person payments or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Our focus ranges from digital accounts (such as fintech and gig economy platforms) to business programs such as employee payroll, health savings accounts and solutions for small business owners. Our prepaid programs also offer opportunities in the private and public sectors to drive financial inclusion of previously unbanked individuals through social security payments, unemployment benefits and salary cards.\nConsumer Bill Payments. Our solutions enable consumers and small businesses to pay their billers in a seamless and secure way, providing an experience that offers flexibility and benefits consumers, financial institutions and billers. Utilizing our merchant acceptance network (which includes many billers), we offer consumers the choice of paying their bills in a convenient and secure manner using credit, debit or prepaid as well as account-based payments methods. \n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\n![alt  Commercial point of sale.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000011/ma-20241231_g16.jpg)\nITEM 1.

It consists of three principles:•Create value•Grow together•Move fastThese principles address where we are going as an organization, how we work together and how we deliver for our customers and each other.                                 \n•A competitive compensation approach (subject to periodic reviews) under which eligible employees across multiple job levels can receive long-term incentive equity awards\n•Contributions to employees’ financial well-being as they plan for retirement. All employees globally are entitled to receive a matching Mastercard contribution of $1.67 for every $1 contributed to a 401(k) or other retirement plan on the first 6% of base pay\n•Continued expansion and prioritization of well-being offerings for employees, including access to mental, physical and financial health resources, additional paid time off for dependent care, and support for family planning \n•Flexibility policies and programs to support employees, including a four-week ”work from elsewhere” policy, meeting-free days and a hybrid work approach with an average of at least three days in the office per week\n•Supporting employees in giving back to their communities, including providing matching gifts for any charitable donations that they make, donating to the charities of their choice for every hour that they volunteer, and providing five paid days per year for full-time employees to engage in eligible volunteer work\n•Experience surveys that we periodically run to assess our overall employee engagement areas (with occasional focus on more targeted topics) and prioritize how we address emerging opportunity areas\n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n•A culture of high ethical business practices and compliance standards, grounded in honesty, decency, trust and personal accountability. It is driven by “tone at the top,” reinforced with regular training, fostered in a speak-up environment, and measured by our periodic employee surveys and other metrics that enable our Board to maintain a pulse on areas of strength and opportunities for improvement\nEnvironment. We focus on creating an environment that benefits and provides equal opportunities for all of our employees. This helps us build a healthy culture, attract talent and drive long-term value for stockholders. We are dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered. We are continuously evolving our approach, guided by the following priorities:\n•We customize our global inclusion strategies by region. These strategies, implemented and executed by local leadership, are designed to ensure we reflect the viewpoints of appropriate stakeholders and consider cultural nuances as part of our work towards providing equal opportunities for all of our employees\n•We remain dedicated to practices designed to ensure there is equal pay for equal work. We have established a framework for examining pay practices annually, supported by third-party analysis and benchmarked to the external market. We assess compensation decisions for potential pay disparities\n* The employee data provided excludes the workforce of Recorded Future, which was acquired in December 2024.\n![alt  ma-20201231_g11.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141391/000114139125000011/ma-20241231_g24.jpg)\nBrand\nOur family of well-known brands includes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus. We manage and promote our brands and brand identities through advertising, promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media initiatives, in order to increase people’s preference for our brands and usage of our products.  We sponsor a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties to align with consumer segments important to us and our customers. Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, preference and overall usage among account holders globally.  Our “Priceless®” advertising campaign, which has run in more than 50 languages and in more than 120 countries worldwide, promotes Mastercard usage benefits and acceptance, markets Mastercard payment products and solutions and provides Mastercard with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brands around the globe.  \nData and AI\nWe create a range of products and services for our customers (including most of our services and solutions) that use our data and AI assets, technology, expertise and platforms. These products and services are designed to make commerce smarter, safer and more personal. These data assets include data from an increasing variety of sources, such as transaction data (including from gateway, card, real-time payments and open banking), digital identities, buyer/supplier payment preferences, device attributes, digital threat assessments and rewards redemptions. We continually invest in data cleansing, structuring and modeling as well as robust governance to make this data available for use in AI to be deployed at scale. We utilize our data using traditional analytical methodologies and an ever-increasing range of AI, including machine learning, natural-language processing, neural networks and generative AI. We aim to help power economies and empower people through AI-driven initiatives that enhance security, data analysis, personalization and efficiency. \nWe do all this while following our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data. We seek to do this in a number of ways: \n•Implementing accountability. We practice robust data and AI governance aimed at ensuring that we have the right controls and oversight over the use of our data and technology\n•Practicing data minimization. We practice collecting and retaining only the personal information that is needed for a given product or service, and limiting the amount and type of personal information shared with third parties\n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n•Being transparent and providing control. We explain how we use personal information and AI and give individuals access and control over how their data is used and shared\n•Working with trusted partners. Our processes are designed to ensure we select partners and service providers who share our principled-approach to protecting data and using AI\n•Addressing fairness in our data and AI. We are implementing governance and processes to help test and mitigate for bias when we use advanced analytics, including AI and machine learning, to create fair and inclusive solutions that reflect individual, group and societal interests\n•Fostering inclusion and advancing positive social impact. Where possible, we utilize our data sets and analytics capabilities to create innovative solutions to societal challenges, benefit society and promote inclusive financial, social, climate, health and education growth\nTechnology\nWe utilize our technology to help grow our core, diversify into new customers and geographies and build new areas for the future, while also enhancing our operational strength and enabling our employees to deliver effectively for our customers. Our strategy to “lead through technology” includes the following key areas: \nCreating value for customers around the world:\n•Standardizing and simplifying how we connect with customers to provide them with the tools to manage and expand their Mastercard relationship\n•Deploying our cloud-native technology infrastructure to adapt to evolving market conditions and further enhance speed, resiliency and scalability\nEnabling our full range of products and services:\n•Enhancing payment rails and expanding them across payments and services, including providing seamless customer adoption across new services and solutions\n•Further evolving our data infrastructure and utilizing AI to unlock incremental value and ensure ongoing compliance with evolving data laws and regulations\nEmpowering our employees:\n•Improving the speed in which we deliver for our customers through a combination of tools and customer-centric practices \n•Attracting, developing and retaining top technology talent, as well as strengthening our employees’ technology acumen \nRevenue Sources \nMastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payments solutions we provide to our customers. We classify our net revenues, which include the impact of rebates and incentives, from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions. \nWithin our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees to our customers based on GDV (which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and other network-related services. \nWithin our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily related to the following: \n\n•Security solutions•Consumer acquisition and engagement services•Business and market insights•Digital and authentication solutions        •Processing and gateway•Other solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based domestic and cross-border payments and solutions, as well as open banking)     \nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3, Revenue for more detail about our revenue.\n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.\nCompetition\nWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry. We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide services and solutions:\n•General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. \n•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.\n•Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space from providers of infrastructure, applications and services. As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction market share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border P2M and P2P market share. Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n•Digital Wallets and other Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, device manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers. \n•Digital Public Infrastructure and Other Government-Backed Solutions. Governments have been focused on creating and expanding local digital payments structures. Increasingly, these structures include digital public infrastructure (DPI), which is owned by governments and often supported by third parties, and aim to provide payments services as a public good. Government- and central bank-backed structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”), which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants.\n•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment \n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nservice providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an opportunity for us, but could equally compete with our products and services.\n•Services and Solutions Providers. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our other solutions, including open banking. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.\nWe play a valuable role as a trusted intermediary in a complex system, creating value for individual stakeholders and the payments ecosystem overall. Our competitive advantages include:\n\nGlobal network                Highly adaptable and world class global payments network that can reach a variety of parties to enable payments anywhere                                                                                                                  \nFranchise model               Establishing rules, standards and bearing of financial risk (including our settlement guarantee backed by our strong credit standing) that allows for interoperability among all participants                                             \nMulti-rail                    Multiple payments capabilities based on our innovation and technology that enable choice                                                                                                                                                  \nBrand                         Globally recognized and trusted brands                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nData and AI                   Products and services utilizing our data and AI assets, technology, platforms and expertise that incorporate our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles and reflect our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes    \nTalent and culture            World class talent and culture guided by the Mastercard Way, with a focus on providing equal opportunities for all of our employees and “doing well by doing good”                                                                        \nTechnology                    Leading-edge technology that advances the quality, speed and diversity of our offerings and solutions                                                                                                                                     \nGovernment engagement         Ability to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments                                                           \nCollectively, the capabilities that we have created organically, and those that we have obtained through acquisitions, support and build upon each other to enhance the total proposition we offer our customers. They enable us to partner with many participants in the broader payments ecosystem and provide choice, security and services to improve the value we provide to our customers. \n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a technology company in the global payments industry, we are subject to government regulation that impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to the laws and regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our products and services are used. We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and implementing policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance. We monitor and coordinate globally while acting locally and establish relationships to assess and manage the effects of regulation on us. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples of the regulation to which we are subject. \n\nPayments Oversight and Regulation. Central banks and other regulators around the world either have established, or are seeking to establish, formal oversight over participants in the payments industry, as well as authority to regulate payments systems in their countries. Such authority has resulted in certain of these entities regulating Mastercard as financial market infrastructure, as well as establishing oversight related to various aspects of our business (including areas such as consumer protections and cybersecurity). In the European Union (the “EU”), Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation, which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations related to governance and risk management. In the U.K., the Bank of England designated Vocalink™, our real-time account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service provider”, and Mastercard as a “recognized payment system”, which includes supervisions and examination requirements. In addition, EU legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make decisions and organize our structure. Examples of other markets where Mastercard is formally overseen include Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and Canada. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated as payments institutions and payment service providers, including as money transmitters. This regulation subjects us to licensing obligations, regulatory supervision and examinations, as well as various business conduct and risk management requirements.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation.

The bill, which is no longer active but could be reintroduced in the new Congress, stipulated that the top two networks could not be enabled on the same card, leaving room for regional networks to serve as second options. The bill proposed to mandate Mastercard provide authentication, tokenization or other security technology to competing networks, whether or not the transaction is switched by Mastercard.                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     •In October 2024, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a rule requiring data providers to make covered data available to consumers and authorized third parties, promoting industry standard-setting bodies recognized by the CFPB, and outlining obligations for third parties accessing data on behalf of consumers (including limitations on the collection, use and retention of covered data). The rule provides for phased-in compliance deadlines, which start in April 2026 and are tiered based on institution size.                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     •In November 2024, in compliance with newly effective registration requirements under the Retail Payment Activities Act in Canada, Mastercard registered its entities that provide certain defined payment functions with the Bank of Canada. These entities are required to implement operational risk, safeguarding of funds, and reporting frameworks under the Act by September 2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nPreferential or Protective Government Actions.  Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies. Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted data localization requirements, which mandate the collection, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders. This is the case, for instance, in India, China and Saudi Arabia. Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions are also under consideration in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU. \nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption.  We are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the European Union. We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”). We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and U.S. and EU sanctions programs. In the U.S., these obligations include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran and Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.\nIssuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, which can indirectly impact us. Additionally, regulations such as the EU’s Payment Services Directive in the EEA require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products. Authorities in the EU are also revising standards relating to the authentication of transactions, which may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\nRegulation of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted regulation related to internet transactions (such as laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports), which impacts both us and our customers. We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco. \nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security.  Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and information security laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world. For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a number of state data and privacy laws. We and our customers may also be subject to evolving U.S. federal and/or state AI laws and regulations. With respect to information security, we are subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protection and information security program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred. Laws and regulations in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulation in the EU as well as other places). In \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\naddition, the interpretation and application of these privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance.\nSustainability Disclosures. Various jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering adopting laws, regulations and oversight expectations requiring disclosure on environmental, social and governance matters. Regulations already adopted or being considered include required corporate reporting and disclosures on topics with respect to climate, such as the U.K. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“EU CSRD”), and, to the extent they become effective, SEC rules related to climate change. Other adopted or potential regulations focus on social topics, including human rights, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, the treatment of employees and diversity of workforce, such as in the EU CSRD.\nAdditional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving laws and guidance surrounding buy-now-pay-later, open banking, credit reporting, digital currencies, marijuana, prepaid payroll cards, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, marketing and operational resilience.\nAdditional Information\nMastercard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2001.

Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular product may consider extending their jurisdiction to other products. For example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit products. Moreover, several jurisdictions are demonstrating increased interest about the network fees we charge to our customers (in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments), which could in the future lead to regulation relating to our network fees. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a “systemically important payment system”, with other regulators considering similar designations. This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities, and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or designation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction.\nOur strategic expansion of our products and services has also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses that typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations. \nIncreased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and/or limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees we charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nchanges, which could negatively impact us. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.\nIncreased activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.\nInterchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products associated with our payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).\nGovernments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, regulation and litigation. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nIf issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party payments system. Alternatively, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services, or seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the expense of their payment programs (particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge). These and other impacts could make our products less desirable to consumers, limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive, ultimately reducing the volume of transactions over our network and our profitability.\nWe are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In addition, regulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the amount of which could be material.\nLimitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Canada, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, our no-surcharge rules now permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards (subject to certain limitations). If, over time, an increased number of merchants choose to surcharge as permitted, this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment. These responses could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nPreferential or Protective Government Actions\nPreferential or protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.\nGovernments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national or domestic payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national provider. These actions may displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers. For example:\n•Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory requirements that mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies. \n•Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering implementing, requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications as well as increased compliance burdens and other costs. \n•Geopolitical events and any resulting OFAC sanctions, adverse trade policies, enforcement of U.S. laws related to countering the financing of terrorism, economic sanctions and anti-corruption, or other types of government actions could lead affected or other jurisdictions to take actions in response that could adversely affect our business. Moreover, because of various concerns \n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\njurisdictions may have with respect to our business, including our decision to suspend business operations in Russia, such jurisdictions may decide to begin to or increase their focus on growing local payment networks and other solutions. \n•Regional groups of countries are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our switching of regional transactions.\n•Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures, which are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. \nSuch developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers. In addition, to the extent a jurisdiction determines us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements (including those related to data localization), we have been, and may again in the future be, subject to resource and time pressures in order to come back into compliance. Our inability to effect change in, or work with, these jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand. \nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, foreign ownership restrictions, which could potentially have the effect of forcing or inducing the transfer of our technology and proprietary information as a condition of access to their markets. Such restrictions could adversely impact our ability to compete in these markets. \nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security\nRegulation and enforcement of privacy, data, AI, information security and the digital economy could increase our costs and lead to legal claims and fines, as well as negatively impact our growth and reputation.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex, fragmented and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, data use and governance, AI and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. While policymakers around the globe often look to the EU and the GDPR when adopting new or updated privacy and data protection laws, divergences have occurred and continue to occur. As a result, new or updated privacy and data protection and information security laws and regulations have led, and may continue to lead, to similar, stricter or at times conflicting requirements, creating an uncertain regulatory environment. For example, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry and other industries in which we participate, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements. In addition, laws and regulations on AI, data governance and credit decisioning may overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Overall, these myriad laws and regulations may require us to modify or limit our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and requirements (including as a result of conflicting regulations) could result in fines, sanctions or other enforcement actions or penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\nAs a user and deployer of AI technology, we are also subject to increasing and evolving laws and regulations related to AI governance, including the EU AI Act, and new applications of existing laws and regulations to AI. How our use and deployment of AI will be regulated is still developing as policymakers around the world consider how to regulate AI, and uncertainty remains as to how AI technology will continue to advance. In addition, the use of AI creates or amplifies risks that are challenging to fully prevent or mitigate. In particular, AI algorithms may generate inaccurate, unintended, unfair, biased or discriminatory outcomes (which may not be easily detectable or explainable) and may inadvertently disclose confidential information and/or breach intellectual property, privacy or other rights. Our implementation of robust AI governance and risk management frameworks aimed at complying with emerging laws and regulations may not be sufficient protection against these emerging risks. \nFurther, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace, we have expanded and may further expand our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and involving new partners. This expansion has amplified and may continue to amplify the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business or subject us to new laws and regulations. For example, our acquisition of Recorded Future, a global threat intelligence company, increases our exposure to certain laws and regulations, including global cybercrime and other laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. We also need to provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in products leveraging AI.\nNew requirements and rules, or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to leverage data or use AI for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nissuing payment products or using information products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our products that they offer. While we intend to comply with all regulatory requirements, innovate responsibly and deploy Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance approaches to all of our product development, the speed and pace of changes in laws (as well as stakeholder interests) may not allow us to meet rapidly evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. \nOther Regulation \nRegulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. Many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that, at times, consequently affect us. Such regulation has increased significantly in the last several years (as described in “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1). Examples include:\n•Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption. We are subject to AML and CFT laws and regulations globally. Economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies, and persons and entities. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. \n•Account-based Payments Systems. In the U.K., aspects of our Vocalink business are subject to the U.K. payment system oversight regime and are directly overseen by the Bank of England.\n•Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Certain regulations that impact our issuers and acquirers may impact various aspects of our business. For example, strong authentication requirements within the EU’s Payment Services Directive in the EEA could increase the number of transactions consumers abandon if we are unable to secure a frictionless authentication experience under these standards. Such an increase could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics.\nIncreased regulatory focus on us has resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers and other stakeholders may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any potential compliance burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Moreover, while our risk-based compliance program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with U.S., EU and local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure of those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes could ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AML, CFT, and anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and/or have a significant reputational impact. Each instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and/or our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Current and potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance, are continuously being considered and have been or may be enacted (such as guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits). These changes have and in the future may continue to have an impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us. \nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Jurisdictions around the globe have also increased tax-related audits, which require time and resources to resolve.\nAny changes in enacted tax laws, rules, regulatory or judicial interpretations or guidance; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any changes in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nLitigation\nLiabilities or business limitations resulting from litigation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims (as described in Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8). In the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings (particularly in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable), we could be subject to significant damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nCertain limitations have been placed on our business because of litigation and litigation settlements, such as changes to our no-surcharge rule in the U.S. and Canada. Any future limitations resulting from the outcomes of any litigation or regulatory proceeding, including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our relationships with our customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nBusiness and Operations\nCompetition and Technology\nSubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments systems, digital wallets and other fintechs (focused on online activity across various channels and processing payments using in-house capabilities), digital public infrastructure and other government-backed solutions and digital currencies. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our services and other solutions. \nOur traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs, services, and payment capabilities than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative programs, services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth. \nCertain of our competitors to our payment network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers, potentially providing competitive advantages. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See “Business - Competition” in Part I, Item 1.\nCertain of our competitors have developed alternative, e-commerce and/or mobile device payments systems, as well as physical store locations. A number of these competitors rely principally on technology to support their services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may benefit from lower costs than we do. Many of these competitors are also able to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreover, these competitors also occupy various roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. With respect to government-backed solutions, including those involving DPI, government participation in structures could prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies. Any of these factors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. \nOur ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competition-related regulatory proceedings and both central bank and legislative activity. \nIf we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nDisintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including the following:\n•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries (such as merchants and third-party payment processors) may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process by switching transactions directly with issuers or processing transactions directly between issuers and acquirers.\n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\n•Payments industry participants may develop their own products and services to support our switched transaction and payments offerings, forcing us to change our pricing or practices for our own offerings in order to compete. In addition, governments may promote their own national or international payments platforms, potentially putting us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or requiring us to compete differently. Moreover, as central banks experiment with CBDCs, policies and design considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating CBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the transactions that we may process over our network.\n•Payments industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with both our payment network and our additional payments capabilities. \n•Fintechs and technology companies could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments as well as develop products or services that compete with our customers and could diminish demand for our products and services. In addition, we face a heightened risk that data we share with these companies as part of our products and services could be used in a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n•Payments industry participants may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services, leverage other business models to create a competitive edge over us or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and services.\n•Regulation may disintermediate issuers by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route payment transactions toward their own forms of payment by offering account information or payment initiation services directly to our product users. Such regulation may also provide these processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. Disintermediation of our customers’ business could diminish demand for our products and services.\nOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nContinued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nIn order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts so as to meet customer demand for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. As a result, we may not be able to grow our volume and/or services enough to compensate for the additional costs related to these increased incentives and pricing discounts. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.\nIn the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger with greater financial resources and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided in order to benefit from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. In addition to decisions made by competitors and customers, we also face pressure from pricing regulation and litigation. \nAdditionally, we face pricing pressure related to real-time account-based payment schemes. These pressures impact both domestic pricing (such as the increased use of schemes that offer increasingly lower or subsidized P2M pricing) and cross-border pricing (including from both competing schemes and global initiatives to lower the cost of cross-border payments to end users). \nAny of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nRapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, including new technologies and changes to existing technologies (such as cryptocurrency and blockchain, AI, machine learning, privacy enhancement and cybersecurity). These changes could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services. They may also result in new and innovative payment methods, products and services. \nAdditionally, there are a number of factors relating to technology change that could impact us. These include: the inability of third parties on which we rely for the development of and access to new technologies to keep pace with technological changes; potential action from third-party patent holders, including notices or inquiries threatening litigation against us or our customers for alleged \n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\npatent infringement or demanding significant license fees; the scope of, as well as customer and merchant resistance to, industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to tokenization or other safety and security technologies); any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining employees with technology expertise; and the need to invest resources for new technologies, which could lead to further additional expenses. Any of these developments could impact our ability to develop and adopt new technologies, as well as improve and keep pace with current technologies and reflect such technology in our payments offerings. \nMoreover, regulatory or government requirements could continue to require us to host and deliver certain products and services on-soil in certain markets. As a result, we may need to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting in additional expenses and/or other operational impacts. \nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we fail to sufficiently develop and adopt new technologies, or improve and keep pace with current technologies and reflect such technology in our payments offerings, our payments offerings could be negatively impacted and/or we could be put at a competitive disadvantage. This could impact our ability to compete with new technologies and products, as well as encourage customers that use our technology to enhance and deliver their payment-related products and services (including fintechs and technology companies) to use their own technology to compete against us. These developments could lead to a decline in the use of our technology, products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nOperating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could materially affect our business.\nU.K. regulators have designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments network platform, to be a “specified service provider” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments systems in similar ways. Any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts, including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of related regulatory risks, see our risk factor in “Risk Factors - Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address information security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our payment network. Operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products, or information security breaches on our real-time account-based payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services, result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation.\nWorking with new customers and end users as we continue to expand our products and services can present operational and onboarding challenges, be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not perform as intended.\nThe payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs. In order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments markets, we are continually involved in developing and implementing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our products and services. These efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems. These projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers (such as corporations that are not financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and new end users). These differences may present new operational challenges, such as enhanced infrastructure and monitoring for less regulated customers.\nOur failure to effectively design and deliver these products and services could make our other offerings less desirable to these customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services (which could include compliance obligations, such as AML and CFT, and licensing requirements for applicable products and services), if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, or we are unable to otherwise adequately anticipate risks related to new types of customers, we could face additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation.\nInformation Security and Operational Resilience\nInformation security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, “hacktivists”, terrorists, nation-states, state-sponsored actors and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code (including ransomware), social-engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation or loss of consumer account and other information and identity theft. These types of threats have risen \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nsignificantly due to a significant portion of our workforce working in a hybrid environment. These threats also may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of AI.\nOur operations rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers and account holders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control. We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers, have been subject to attempted cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption. \nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems that support our business and customers (such as the lack of availability of our services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties.  In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers, other stakeholders and the broader payments ecosystem, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we are deemed critical national infrastructure. If such attacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded.\nIn addition to information security risks for our systems and networks, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or brands resulting from an account data breach of our systems and networks or those of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more difficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. While we offer security solutions that are designed to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such security solutions will perform as expected or address all possible security threats. Real or perceived defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security solutions could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions and our business and may subject us to litigation, governmental audits and investigation or other liabilities. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.\nIn addition, companies have generally experienced in recent years an increase in fraudulent activity and cyber-attacks. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud and may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI. As outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. We continue to take measures to make card and digital payments more secure. However, increased fraud levels and cyber-attacks involving our products, services and/or network, or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our products and services could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services and/or increase our compliance costs. Further, such occurrences have resulted in and could further result in legislative or regulatory intervention, which could lead to enhanced security requirements and liabilities. See “Risk Factors - Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security Compliance” in this Part I, Item 1A for more detail concerning related legal risks and obligations. \nDespite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with which we work, will not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to protect us from such losses as well as any liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of our confidential, proprietary, sensitive or personal information or our technologies, systems or networks. In addition, we cannot be sure \n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nthat our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent role in the global payments ecosystem, our continued implementation of our strategic priorities, our extensive use of third-party vendors and potential vulnerabilities from previous and future acquisitions, strategic investments or related opportunities. As a result, we remain focused on the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our computer systems, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nService disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could reduce our operational resilience and materially affect our overall business and results of operations.\nOur transaction switching systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, supply-chain attacks, fire, floods, earthquakes, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events (including those related to climate change). We have experienced in limited instances, and may continue to experience, some types of these interruptions. Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities, networks and/or systems. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks. Due to the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.\nStakeholder Relationships\nLosing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.\nMany of our customer relationships are not exclusive. Our customers can reassess their future commitments to us subject to the terms of our contracts, and they separately may develop their own services that compete with ours. Our business agreements with these customers may not ultimately reduce the risk (inherent in our business) that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. Loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nExclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business. \nWhile we have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with certain of our customers to issue payment products, other customers have similar exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with these customers to increase our revenues. In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nConsolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nThe industries in which our customers participate have undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. These consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor. Potential future consolidation could occur as a result of bank failures, similar to those that occurred in the U.S. in recent years. If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their \n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nbargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.\nWhile we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system (including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies), we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations” in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations.\nWith the exception of the U.S. and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using cards with our brands are switched by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries or have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\nMerchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and/or increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nMerchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in addition to interchange. See “Risk Factors – Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment (including digital) may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nCertain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition of accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows, our business could suffer.\nOur work with governments exposes us to risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\nAs we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in scope changes or termination of the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our products and services.\n•Our work with governments is heavily regulated, subjecting us to additional potential exposure under U.S. and international anti-corruption laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as compliance with various procurement and other laws, regulations, standards and contract terms. Any violation and subsequent judgment or settlement related to the above could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a significant reputational impact. \n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nMoreover, as a government contractor, we are subject to a government’s right to conduct audits and investigations into both our contract performance and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Any adverse finding could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or disbarment. \n•Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial institution customers, can subject us to heightened reputational risks, including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association with the policies of those governments. Any negative publicity or negative association with a government entity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, threat intelligence gathering services provided to governments through our acquisition of Recorded Future could negatively impact how we are viewed by other jurisdictions. \nAny of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations. \nGlobal Economic and Political Environment\nGlobal economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nAdverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance. Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n•Customers mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability from us \n•Consumers and businesses reducing spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend\n•Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. have affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer confidence and spending\n•Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments on or in our financial institution customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products\n•Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility\nCross-border transactions. We switch substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions. Revenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border activity has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions. These include or have included: \n•Global pandemics (and related post-pandemic global economic impacts) and potential separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics) \n•Current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business\n•The threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change) \nThe impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity. Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the targets announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive. \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sanctions and our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia has led, and could further lead, to other legal ramifications and operational challenges, including fines, the nationalization of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.\nStandards. Our operations as a global payments network rely in part on global interoperable standards to help facilitate payments. To the extent geopolitical events or government intervention result in jurisdictions no longer participating in the creation or adoption of these standards, or the creation of competing standards, our products and services could be negatively impacted.\nAny of these developments potentially could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.\nDuring 2024, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the U.S., which could be transacted in a non-functional currency. Impacts from currency fluctuations are included in our net income. Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies. \nIn addition, the revenue we generate in entities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations, including where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected. \nFurthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion into U.S. dollars of our other revenue currencies and financial assets.\nThe occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nBrand, Reputational Impact and Environmental, Social and Governance\nNegative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.\nOur brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry:\n•Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”. Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other companies and organizations that use our products and services (including certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco) may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny, as well as potential litigation. We may also face similar scrutiny to the extent that we are unable to detect and/or prevent illegal activities using our payment products or otherwise occurring over our network. \n•Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products. \n•We are headquartered in the U.S. As such, a negative perception of the U.S. could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business. \nAny of the above issues could have a material and adverse effect on our overall business.\nLack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology, may materially and adversely affect our business. \nAs more players enter the global payments ecosystem, the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase. We often partner with other consumer brands on payment solutions, including large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience. This brand invisibility, or any consumer confusion as to our role in the consumer payment experience, could decrease the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our business. \nEnvironmental, social and governance matters and related stakeholder reaction may impact our reputation, increase legal exposure and/or have other business impacts, which could adversely affect our overall business and/or results of operations. \nOur brand and reputation are associated with the ways in which we impact environmental, social and governance matters. These matters include initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help everyone participate equitably in the digital economy and create a workplace that provides equal opportunities for all of our employees. Consumers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on these impacts. To the extent any of our disclosures, public statements and metrics about these matters are subsequently viewed as inaccurate, or we are unable to execute on these initiatives, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, in recent years, we have received negative feedback from stakeholders on the adequacy of our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We have also increasingly been receiving negative feedback from anti-environmental, social and governance stakeholders in opposition to such initiatives. Stakeholders from both \n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nsides of this issue may continue to view us negatively and take public action against us to the extent that we do not satisfy their conflicting views or expectations.\nIn addition, various jurisdictions are increasingly adopting or considering laws, regulations and oversight expectations that have or would impact us pertaining to environmental, social and governance matters, including required corporate reporting and disclosures. These requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased compliance costs for our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs. \nMoreover, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressure to address climate change and other environmental, social and governance matters, these stakeholders may express new expectations and focus investments in ways that could cause significant shifts in commerce and consumption behaviors. The impact of and uncertainty that could result from such shifts could ultimately impact our business. \nAny of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.\nTalent and Culture\nWe may not be able to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could harm our overall business and results of operations.\nOur performance largely depends on the skills, capabilities and motivation of our employees (including our people leaders), as well as the environment we create for them to enable them to perform their jobs effectively. The market for specialized skill-sets remains highly competitive, particularly in technology and other areas that are important to the growth of our business. To the extent we are unable to differentiate our value proposition in the market, effectively develop leaders and build robust succession pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver for our customers. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified employee talent could leave us vulnerable to not anticipating or identifying emerging customer or market opportunities. In addition, escalations in global conflict and a rise in mental health needs are also impacting the well-being of our people. To the extent we are unable to communicate effectively on these issues and provide support to our employees, we could experience a significant impact on our business, reputation and culture. Further, changes in and enforcement of immigration and work permit laws and visa regulations have made it difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions where we operate, potentially impairing our ability to attract and retain talent. We also face increasing regulation with respect to new pay and benefits transparency requirements, which could subject us to liability or reputational harm if we do not adhere to these requirements in a timely manner.\nAs our workforce composition continues to change, our employees may have different expectations with respect to flexibility and well-being support, and may have different career motivations (such as pursuing project-based work or other gig opportunities, as opposed to linear career paths). Additionally, employees may require different levels of support as to re-skilling and upskilling in order to adapt to advancements in our industry and changes in technology. Further, certain current and prospective employees may have expectations as to positions we take on environmental, social and governance matters. To the extent we are unable to effectively meet and/or balance these different expectations, motivations and needs, we could experience a negative impact to the quality of our corporate culture, the productivity of our workforce, our ability to innovate and our ability to attract and retain talent. \nWe rely on our people leaders to display integrity and decency, as role models for the Mastercard Way. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with these values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate culture.\nAny one or more of the above could harm our overall business and results of operations. \nAcquisitions and Strategic Investments\nOur efforts to enter into acquisitions, strategic investments or new businesses could be impacted or prevented by regulatory scrutiny and could otherwise result in issues that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation.\nWe continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions of, and investments in, complementary businesses, products or technologies. As we do so, we face increasing regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust, national security and other considerations that could impact these efforts. We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies. As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these efforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth. \nTo the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and focused efforts. Such an integration also may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we have spent, and may continue to spend, time and money on acquisitions or projects that do \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K \n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nnot sufficiently meet our expectations (either strategically or financially), which has resulted (and may in the future result) in divesting from or otherwise exiting these investments or businesses. Additionally, to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we have inherited and may in the future inherit litigation risk which has or may increase our post-acquisition costs of operations and/or impact our ability to successfully finance that business.\nAny acquisition, investment or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations or legal requirements, both directly as a result of the new business as well as in the other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements. Additionally, targets that we acquire have had, and may in the future have, data practices that do not initially conform to our privacy, data protection and information security standards and data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. These targets also have resulted in, and may in the future lead to, information security vulnerabilities for us. \nSettlement and Third-Party Obligations\nOur role as guarantor, as well as other contractual obligations and discretionary actions, expose us to risk of loss or illiquidity.\nWe are a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of certain of our customers and service providers. In this capacity, we are exposed to credit and liquidity risks. We may incur significant losses in connection with transaction settlements if a customer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons. The occurrence of bank failures, such as those seen in recent years in the U.S., could increase the potential for such losses. Concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources. In addition, as we are subject to increased regulation across the globe, jurisdictions could require us to extend our guarantee to additional obligations, which could have an impact on our cost of operations.\nCertain non-guaranteed transactions, as well as chargebacks to acquirers in the event of acquirer default, could result in elevated brand risk and the potential for financial loss. \nWe have significant contractual indemnification obligations with certain customers, which could be triggered depending on the circumstances.\nAny of the above issues or events could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.\nClass A Common Stock and Governance Structure\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact on change-in-control.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions, including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control, which could harm our stock price. For example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power. In addition:\n•our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors\n•our stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent\n•any representative of a Mastercard or Mastercard Foundation competitor is disqualified from service on our board of directors\nMastercard Foundation’s substantial stock ownership, and restrictions on its sales, may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to, or favored by, the other public stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Mastercard Foundation owned shares of Class A common stock representing approximately 9.4% of our general voting power. Historically, Mastercard Foundation had been restricted from selling or otherwise transferring its shares of Class A common stock prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements, for which purpose earlier sales were permitted and had occurred. In July 2023, pursuant to an application in consultation with Mastercard, Mastercard Foundation received court approval to advance that date to January 1, 2024. As a result, Mastercard Foundation is now permitted to sell all or part of its remaining shares, subject to certain conditions. In March 2024, Mastercard Foundation began selling shares pursuant to an orderly and structured plan to diversify its Mastercard shares over a seven-year \n\n MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\n\n\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nperiod, while committing to remain a long-term Mastercard stockholder and retaining a significant holding of Mastercard shares in its portfolio. The directors of Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers. The ownership of Class A common stock by Mastercard Foundation, together with the seven-year diversification plan, could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by other holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation intends to sell its shares over an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders.",
