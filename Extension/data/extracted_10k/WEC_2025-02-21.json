UTILITY ENERGY OPERATIONS\nWisconsin Segment\nThe Wisconsin segment includes the electric and natural gas utility operations of WE, WPS, WG, and UMERC.\nElectric Utility Operations\nOur electric utility operations include the operations of WE, WPS, and UMERC.\n•WE generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in southeastern Wisconsin (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central Wisconsin, and northern Wisconsin. \n•WPS generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in northeastern and central Wisconsin.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \n•UMERC generates and distributes electric energy to customers, including one iron ore mine owned by Tilden, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. \nOperating Revenues\nFor information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, and Note 4, Operating Revenues.\nElectric Sales\nOur electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail, wholesale, and resale customers, and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In 2024, retail revenues accounted for 93.4% of total electric operating revenues, wholesale revenues accounted for 2.1% of total electric operating revenues, and resale revenues accounted for 3.6% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholders for information on MWh sales by customer class.\nOur electric utilities are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. \nWe provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers.\nThe majority of our sales for resale are sold into an energy market operated by MISO at market rates based on the availability of our generation and market demand. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the cost of sales derived from these opportunity sales.\nOur electric utilities buy and sell electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets compared to our competitors affects how often our generating units are dispatched and whether we buy or sell power. For more information on the MISO Energy Markets, see E. Regulation.\nSteam Sales\nWE has a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by the VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions. \nElectric Sales Forecast\nOur service territory experienced relatively flat weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2024, compared with 2023. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to increase 0.7% for 2025, assuming normal weather.\nCustomers\n\n                                                                                                        Year Ended December 31\n(in thousands)                                                    2024                        2023                        2022\nElectric customers – end of year                                                                                              \nResidential                                                1,499.4                     1,487.9                     1,471.4    \nSmall commercial and industrial                              180.8                       179.0                       176.9    \nLarge commercial and industrial                                0.8                         0.8                         0.9    \nWholesale and other                                            1.7                         1.6                         1.6    \nTotal electric customers – end of year                     1,682.7                     1,669.3                     1,650.8    \nSteam customers – end of year                                  0.4                         0.4                         0.4    \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nElectric Commercial and Industrial Retail Customers\nWe provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in industries such as metals and other manufacturing, paper, governmental, food manufacturing, and health services.\nElectric Generation and Supply Mix\nOur electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from a diverse generation portfolio that is expected to balance a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity with environmental stewardship. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from generation that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term PPAs, including the Point Beach PPA discussed under the heading \"Power Purchase Commitments,\" and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess power supply into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.\nThe table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years ended December 31, as well as estimates for 2025:\n\n                                                         Estimate (1)                                                                  Actual\n                                                                 2025                    2024                    2023                    2022\nCompany-owned generation:                                                                                                                    \nCoal                                                      25.7      %                29.4   %                29.0   %                29.4   %\nNatural gas:                                                                                                                                 \nCombined cycle                                            25.4      %                27.2   %                28.7   %                27.2   %\nSteam turbine                                              0.5      %                 1.0   %                 0.9   %                 1.0   %\nNatural gas/oil peaking units                              6.3      %                 7.2   %                 5.5   %                 3.7   %\nRenewables (2)                                             8.5      %                 6.5   %                 5.5   %                 5.8   %\nTotal company-owned generation                            66.4      %                71.3   %                69.6   %                67.1   %\nPower purchase contracts:                                                                                                                    \nNuclear                                                   20.4      %                20.3   %                20.1   %                19.8   %\nNatural gas                                                  —      %                   —   %                   —   %                 2.2   %\nRenewables (2)                                             1.7      %                 1.9   %                 2.0   %                 1.9   %\nOther                                                      0.1      %                   —   %                 0.1   %                 0.2   %\nTotal power purchase contracts                            22.2      %                22.2   %                22.2   %                24.1   %\nPurchased power from MISO                                 11.4      %                 6.5   %                 8.2   %                 8.8   %\nTotal purchased power                                     33.6      %                28.7   %                30.4   %                32.9   %\nTotal electric utility supply                            100.0      %               100.0   %               100.0   %               100.0   %\n(1)    The values included in the estimate assume a natural gas price based on the December 2024 NYMEX.\n(2)    Includes hydroelectric, biomass, solar, and wind generation.\nElectric Generation Facilities\nOur generation portfolio is a mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to balance providing energy that is stable, reliable, and affordable with environmental stewardship. We own 8,158 MWs of generation capacity, including wholly owned and jointly owned facilities. We Power's generating units are also included in the generation capacity. Our facilities include natural gas-fired plants, coal-fired plants, and renewable generation. Certain of our natural gas-fired generation units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our facilities, see Item 2. Properties.\nEnvironmental Goals\nWe have announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 60% by the end of 2025 and by 80% by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. As of the end of 2024, our electric generation fleet has achieved a 56% reduction in carbon emissions from the 2005 baseline. We expect to achieve these goals by continuing to make operating \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nrefinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing our capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for our generation fleet is to be net carbon neutral by 2050. \nAs part of our path toward these goals, we have started implementing co-firing with natural gas at the ERGS coal-fired units and plan to co-fire with natural gas at Weston Unit 4. By the end of 2030, we expect to use coal as a backup fuel only and to be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2032.\nCreating a Sustainable Future\nOur capital plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and reliable, efficient natural gas-fired generation. The retirements are intended to address compliance with the EPA Clean Air rules as well as contribute to meeting our goals to reduce CO2 emissions from our electric generation. When taken together, the retirements and new investments in renewables and reliable, efficient natural gas generation discussed in more detail below should better balance our supply with our demand, while helping to address compliance and maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. \nWe have already retired nearly 2,500 MWs of fossil-fueled generation since the beginning of 2018, which includes the retirement of OCPP Units 5 and 6 in May 2024, the 2019 retirement of the PIPP, and the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating unit. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. We expect to retire approximately 1,200 MWs of additional coal-fired generation by the end of 2031, which includes the planned retirements of OCPP Units 7 and 8, the jointly-owned Columbia Units 1 and 2 while investigating conversion of at least one unit to natural gas, and Weston Unit 3. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.\nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate Developments for more information on our capital plan.\nAlso see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Legislation and Regulation - Our operations, capital expenditures, and financial results may be affected by the impact of greenhouse gas legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals.\nRenewable Generation\nOur electric utilities meet a portion of their electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources, including wind, solar, hydroelectric, and biomass. This helps our electric utilities work towards our goals of reducing carbon emissions while also maintaining compliance with renewable energy legislation. These renewable energy resources also help us maintain diversity in our generation portfolio, which effectively serves as a price hedge against future fuel costs, and will help mitigate the risk of potential unknown costs associated with any future carbon restrictions for electric generators. \nWind\nIn September 2024, WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed a request with the PSCW to acquire and construct Badger Hollow Wind and to acquire Whitetail, two utility-scale wind-powered electric generating facilities. If approved, Badger Hollow Wind will be located in Iowa and Grant counties, Wisconsin, and Whitetail will be located in Grant County, Wisconsin. Once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 100 MWs of wind generation of Badger Hollow Wind and 60 MWs of wind generation of Whitetail. If approved, the construction of both of these projects is expected to be completed in 2027.\nSolar and Battery Storage\nIn December 2024, the construction of the solar portion of Paris located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin was completed, and the facility became commercially operational. Paris is owned by WE, WPS, and an unaffiliated utility, with WE and WPS collectively owning 180 MWs of solar generation. WE and WPS will collectively own 99 MWs of battery storage of this project, with construction expected to be completed in 2025. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nAs part of our commitment to invest in additional zero-carbon generation within our Wisconsin segment, we have filed requests to acquire and construct 868 MWs of additional renewable generation and 244 MWs of battery storage, including the following:\n•In October 2024, WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed a request with the PSCW to acquire and construct Good Oak and Gristmill, two utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facilities.

The project will be located in Dane County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 270 MWs of solar generation and 149 MWs of battery storage of this project. The construction of the solar portion and battery storage is expected to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n•In December 2022, WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Darien, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Rock and Walworth counties, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 225 MWs of solar generation and 68 MWs of battery storage of this project. The construction of the solar portion and battery storage is expected to be completed in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nNatural Gas-Fired Generation\nIn May 2024, WE completed the acquisition of an additional 100 MWs of West Riverside's nameplate capacity, in the second of two option exercises. West Riverside is a commercially operational dual fueled combined cycle generation facility in Beloit, Wisconsin and is operated by an unaffiliated utility. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nIn April 2024, WE filed requests with the PSCW for the following projects:\n•Adding seven natural gas-fired RICE units near the Paris Generating Station. The new RICE units would be fueled with natural gas and capable of producing approximately 128 MWs.\n•Building five natural gas-fired combustion turbines capable of producing approximately 1,100 MWs, which would be located at the existing OCPP site.\nElectric System Reliability\nThe PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO implemented seasonal requirements effective June 1, 2023. The installed capacity reserve margins for the planning year June 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025 are as follows: 17.7% summer (June – August); 25.2% fall (September – November); 49.4% winter (December – February); and 40.8% spring (March – May). MISO's short-term reserve margin requirements experience year-to-year and season-to-season fluctuations, primarily due to changes in the generation resource mix and average forced outage rate of generation within the MISO footprint.\nMichigan legislation requires all electric providers to annually demonstrate to the MPSC that they have adequate resources to serve the anticipated needs of their customers for a minimum of four consecutive planning years beginning in the upcoming planning year June 1, 2025, through May 31, 2026. The MPSC has established future planning reserve margin requirements based on the same study conducted by MISO that determines the short-term reserve margin requirements.\nIn both our Wisconsin and Michigan jurisdictions, we believe that we have adequate capacity through company-owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during the current planning year. We also fully anticipate that we will have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements for the upcoming planning year in both jurisdictions.\nFuel and Purchased Power Costs\nOur retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW generally allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see E. Regulation.\nOur average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type, including delivery costs, were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n\n                                                        2024                       2023                       2022\nCoal                                               $25.38                     $25.80                     $25.37   \nNatural gas combined cycle                          20.52                      30.41                      42.11   \nNatural gas/oil peaking units                       42.41                      56.41                      90.22   \nBiomass                                             81.33                      87.73                      78.42   \nPurchased power                                     57.39                      53.90                      58.78   \nWE and WPS purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services are exposed to volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and diesel fuel. To mitigate against this volatility risk, WE and WPS have PSCW approval for a hedging program. This program allows them to hedge, over a 60-month period, up to 75% of their potential risks related to rail transportation fuel surcharge exposure. The results of this hedging program, when used, are reflected in the average costs of fuel and purchased power.\nWe purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nagreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. WE and WPS also have PSCW approval for a hedging program to mitigate against volatility related to natural gas price risk. This program allows them to hedge, over a 60-month period, up to 75% of their estimated natural gas use for electric generation. The results of this hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas.\nCoal Supply\nWe diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities and jointly-owned plants by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania, as well as from various other states. For 2025, 100% of our total projected coal requirements of 4.3 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.\nThe annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows.\n\n    (in thousands)   Annual Tonnage             \n              2025   4,446          (1)         \n              2026   1,400                      \n              2027   —                          \n(1)    Coal contracts exceed the total projected requirement due to prior year delivery constraints and forecasted lower operating hours.\nCoal Deliveries\nAll of our coal requirements are expected to be shipped by unit trains that we own or lease under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities. For additional information concerning risks related to coal supply chain disruptions, see the risk factor below.\n•Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Economic and Market Volatility – We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities. \nPower Purchase Commitments\nWe enter into short- and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. Excluding planning capacity purchases, our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties consist of 1,133 MWs per year for 2025 through 2029. This amount includes 1,033 MWs per year related to a long-term PPA for electricity generated by Point Beach. To procure additional planning capacity, we purchase capacity from the MISO annual auction to ensure that we maintain our compliance with planning reserve requirements as established by the PSCW, MPSC, and MISO. \nNatural Gas Utility Operations\nWE, WPS, and WG are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. Our Wisconsin natural gas utilities operate throughout the state of Wisconsin, including the City of Milwaukee and surrounding areas, northeastern Wisconsin, and in large areas of both central and western Wisconsin. In addition, UMERC is authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nOur Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities provide service to residential and commercial and industrial customers. In addition, our Wisconsin segment offers natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Major industries served include real estate, food manufacturing, governmental, restaurants, and paper. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Net Income Attributed to Common Shareholders for information on natural gas sales volumes by customer class in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nOperating Revenues\nFor information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, and Note 4, Operating Revenues. \nNatural Gas Sales Forecast \nOur combined Wisconsin service territories experienced slightly lower weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in 2024 as compared to 2023. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow 1.9% in 2025, assuming normal weather.\nCustomers\n\n                                                                                            Year Ended December 31\n(in thousands)                                        2024                        2023                        2022\nCustomers – end of year                                                                                           \nResidential                                    1,391.7                     1,381.7                     1,365.5    \nCommercial and industrial                        135.7                       134.8                       132.8    \nTransportation                                     3.5                         3.5                         3.5    \nTotal customers                                1,530.9                     1,520.0                     1,501.8    \nNatural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage\nWe manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts, storage services, and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies.\nPipeline Capacity and Storage\nWe have long-term firm capacity contracts with interstate pipelines that access supply from a variety of natural gas producing areas. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. \nDue to variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, our Wisconsin natural gas utilities have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. WE, WPS, and WG have entered into long-term service agreements for approximately 99% of a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluewater's natural gas storage. Bluewater owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan and provides approximately one-third of the current storage needs for our Wisconsin natural gas utilities. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 40% of forecasted demand for November through March. Diversity of natural gas supply enables us to manage significant changes in demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months.\nWe contract with interstate pipeline companies, as well as other service providers, to purchase firm transportation and storage services under varied-length long-term contracts. We believe that having diverse capacity and storage benefits our customers.\nCombined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 37.0 million therms for the 2024 through 2025 heating season. Our Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities' peak daily send-out during 2024 was 25.3 million therms on January 16, 2024. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. For information on the GCRMs, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.\nTo ensure a reliable supply of natural gas during peak winter conditions, we have LNG facilities located within our distribution system. These facilities are typically utilized during extreme demand conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers. WE and WG completed construction of LNG facilities that were placed into service in November 2023 and February 2024, respectively, which \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \ntogether provide approximately 2.0 Bcf of natural gas supply. In addition to its existing facilities, WE has filed a request with the PSCW to construct another LNG facility with a storage capacity of 2.0 Bcf. In addition, the construction of additional LNG facilities in Wisconsin has been proposed as part of the 2025-2029 capital plan and would provide another approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas supply. The use of LNG allows us to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. \nNatural Gas Supply\nOur natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, storage, peak-shaving facilities, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets.\nHedging Natural Gas Supply Prices\nAs part of their hedging programs, our Wisconsin utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of a mix of financial instruments, such as NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. WE, WPS, and WG have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand. These approvals allow these companies to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums, brokerage fees, and losses) and proceeds (gains) to customers through their respective GCRMs.\nIllinois Segment\nOur Illinois segment includes the natural gas utility operations of PGL and NSG. Our customers are located in Chicago and the northern suburbs of Chicago. PGL and NSG provide service to residential and commercial and industrial customers. In addition, PGL and NSG offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Major industries served include real estate, education, non-profits, wholesale distributors, and food manufacturing. See Item 7.

For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nPipeline Capacity and Storage\nWe have long-term firm capacity contracts with interstate pipelines that access supply from a variety of natural gas producing areas. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.\nWe own a 38.8 Bcf storage field (Manlove Field in central Illinois) and contract with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. Storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year-round basis, which provides a hedge against supply cost volatility. We also own a natural gas pipeline system that connects Manlove Field to Chicago and nine major interstate pipelines. These assets are directed primarily to serving rate-regulated retail customers and are included in our regulatory rate base. We also use a portion of these company-owned storage and pipeline assets as a natural gas hub, which consists of providing transportation and storage services in interstate commerce to our wholesale customers. Customers deliver natural gas to us for storage through an injection into the storage reservoir, and we return the natural gas to the customers under an agreed schedule through a withdrawal from the storage reservoir. Title to the natural gas does not transfer to us. We recognize service fees associated with the natural gas hub services provided to wholesale customers. These service fees reduce the cost of natural gas and services charged to retail customers in rates. \nCombined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Illinois utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 25.3 million therms for the 2024 through 2025 heating season. Our Illinois utilities' peak daily send-out during 2024 was 19.6 million therms on January 14, 2024. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. For information on the GCRMs, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.\nNatural Gas Supply\nOur natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, storage, peak-shaving facilities, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets.\nHedging Natural Gas Supply Prices\nAs part of their hedging programs, our Illinois utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of a mix of financial instruments, such as NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. Their hedging programs are reviewed by the ICC as part of the annual purchased gas adjustment reconciliation. They hedge between 25% and 50% of planned natural gas purchases, with a target of 37.5%. \nNatural Gas System Modernization Program\nDuring 2023, PGL continued work on the SMP, a project to replace approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure that began in 2011. Prior to December 1, 2023, PGL recovered these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider. Beginning December 1, 2023, recovery of SMP costs are included in PGL's base rates. As part of the ICC's November 16, 2023 rate order issued in PGL's rate case, the ICC ordered PGL to pause spending on its SMP until the ICC had a proceeding to determine the optimal method of pipeline replacement and a prudent investment level. \nThe ICC conducted a limited-scope rehearing related to authorized spending for the completion of SMP projects that started in 2023 and the authorized spending for emergency repairs needed to ensure the safety and reliability of PGL's delivery system. On May 30, 2024, the ICC issued a written order on the rehearing. The order approved $28.5 million of additional spending for emergency work. On June 7, 2024, PGL filed a petition with the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the November 16, 2023 and May 30, 2024 orders, including the disallowance of SMP capital investments needed to meet safety and reliability requirements. Although the ICC ordered PGL to complete safety and reliability work in 2024, it denied the recovery of these costs.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nIn accordance with the November 16, 2023 rate order, the ICC initiated the SMP proceeding in January 2024. On February 20, 2025, the ICC issued an order setting expectations for PGL's prospective operations under its SMP. The ICC directed us to focus on replacing all cast and ductile iron pipe that has a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035. The ICC also indicated that failure to comply with this directive could subject us to civil penalties under Illinois statute. We are evaluating the impact of this order on our operations and capital plan.\nFor information on regulatory proceedings related to the SMP, see Note 26, Regulatory Environment, and Item 7.

For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies.\nPipeline Capacity and Storage\nMGU owns a 2.9 Bcf storage field (Partello in Michigan) and contracts with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. We contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services. We believe that having diverse capacity and storage benefits our customers.\nCombined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Forecasted design peak-day throughput for our other states utilities is 9.6 million therms for the 2024 through 2025 heating season. Our other states utilities' peak daily send-out during 2024 was 7.5 million therms on January 15, 2024. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. For information on the GCRMs, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nNatural Gas Supply\nOur natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, contracted and owned storage, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets.\nHedging Natural Gas Supply Prices\nOur other states utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of financial instruments, such as commodity futures, swaps, and options as part of their hedging programs. MERC has MPUC approval to hedge up to 30% of planned winter demand using NYMEX financial instruments. MGU has MPSC approval to hedge up to 20% of its planned annual purchases using NYMEX financial instruments.\nGeneral\nSeasonality\nElectric Utility Operations – Wisconsin Segment\nOur electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. In 2024, our generating plants performed as expected during the most demanding periods of the year, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, our electric utilities did not make any public appeals for conservation, and they did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. Our electric utilities did have economic interruption events; however, service to customers was not curtailed. Economic interruptions are declared during times in which the price of electricity in the regional market exceeds the cost of operating the company's peaking generation. During this time, customers taking service under these interruptible programs can choose to continue using electricity at a price based on wholesale market prices or to reduce their load. \nNatural Gas Utility Operations – Wisconsin, Illinois, and Other States Segments\nSince the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. The effect on earnings from these changes in weather are reduced by decoupling mechanisms included in the rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes.\nOur natural gas utilities' working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.\nCompetition\nElectric Utility Operations – Wisconsin Segment\nOur electric utilities face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by customers and alternative energy sources. Our electric utilities compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nNatural Gas Utility Operations – Wisconsin, Illinois, and Other States Segments\nOur natural gas utilities also face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. Electrification initiatives or mandates are being considered or proposed by local and state governments. In addition, the majority of our natural gas customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. Our natural gas utilities offer transportation services for customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. We continue to earn distribution revenues from these transportation customers for their use of our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. \nFor more information on electrification initiatives in certain of our Illinois service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters - Chicago Decarbonization Efforts.\nFor more information on competition in each of our service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Competitive Markets.\nEnvironmental Goals\nNatural Gas Utility Operations – Wisconsin, Illinois, and Other States Segments\nWe also continue to focus on methane emission reductions by improving our natural gas distribution systems. We set a target across our natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. We plan to achieve our net-zero goal through an effort that includes continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout our natural gas utility systems. In 2022, we received approval from the PSCW for our RNG pilots and in 2023, we began transporting the output of local dairy farms onto our natural gas distribution systems in Wisconsin. The RNG supplied will directly replace higher-emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. We currently have contracts in place for 2.1 Bcf of RNG. In addition, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to procure RTCs.\nC. ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT\nATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including WE, WPS, and UMERC, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and certain state regulatory commissions for routing and siting of transmission projects. ATC is also a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and WE, WPS, and UMERC are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO. As of December 31, 2024, our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 60%. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 75% of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. See Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information.\nThe FERC and D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals have issued orders and an opinion, respectively, related to the authorized base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters – American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints for more information.\nD. NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS\nNon-Utility Energy Infrastructure Segment\nThe non-utility energy infrastructure segment includes We Power, which owns and leases generating facilities to WE; Bluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan; and WECI, which holds ownership interests in several renewable generating facilities. See Item 2. Properties, for more information on our non-utility energy infrastructure facilities.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nW.E. Power, LLC\nWe Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, designed and built approximately 2,500 MWs of generation in Wisconsin. This generation is made up of capacity from the two coal-fired ERGS units, ER 1 and ER 2, which were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and the two natural gas-fired PWGS units, PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, which were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Two unaffiliated entities collectively own approximately 17%, or approximately 211 MWs, of ER 1 and ER 2. We Power's share of the ERGS units and both PWGS units are being leased to WE under long-term leases (the ERGS units have 30-year leases that began on the in-service dates of the generating units and the PWGS units have 25-year leases that began on the in-service dates of the generating units). As part of our carbon emission reduction goals, we have started implementing co-firing with natural gas at the ERGS coal-fired units. For information on our carbon emission reduction goals, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate Developments.\nBecause of the significant investment necessary to construct these generating units, we constructed the plants under Wisconsin's Leased Generation Law, which allows a non-utility affiliate to construct an electric generating facility and lease it to the public utility. The law allows a public utility that has entered into a lease approved by the PSCW to recover fully in its retail electric rates that portion of any payments under the lease that the PSCW has allocated to the public utility's Wisconsin retail electric service, and all other costs that are prudently incurred in the public utility's operation and maintenance of the electric generating facility allocated to the utility's Wisconsin retail electric service. In addition, the PSCW may not modify or terminate a lease it has approved under the Leased Generation Law except as specifically provided in the lease or the PSCW's order approving the lease. This law effectively created regulatory certainty in light of the significant investment being made to construct the units. All four units were constructed under leases approved by the PSCW.\nWe are recovering our costs of these units, including subsequent capital additions, through lease payments that are billed from We Power to WE and then recovered in WE's rates as authorized by the PSCW and the FERC. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% ROE and the equity ratio is assumed to be 55% for the ERGS units and 53% for the PWGS units.\nBluewater Natural Gas Holding, LLC \nBluewater, located in Michigan, primarily provides natural gas storage and hub services to our Wisconsin natural gas utilities. WE, WPS, and WG have entered into long-term service agreements for approximately one-third of their combined natural gas storage needs with a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluewater.\nWEC Infrastructure LLC \nAt December 31, 2024, our non-utility energy infrastructure segment included WECI's ownership interests in the renewable generating facilities reflected in the table below.\n\nName                          Ownership Interest   Commercial Operation    \nBishop Hill III                            90.0%   August 2018             \nUpstream                                   90.0%   January 2019            \nCoyote Ridge                               81.6%   December 2019           \nBlooming Grove                             90.0%   December 2020           \nTatanka Ridge                              85.6%   January 2021            \nJayhawk                                    90.0%   December 2021           \nThunderhead                                90.0%   November 2022           \nSamson I (1)                               90.0%   May 2022                \nSapphire Sky                               90.0%   February 2023           \nMaple Flats                                90.0%   November 2024           \nDelilah I                                  90.0%   December 2024           \n(1)    Although Samson I was commercially operational in May 2022, WECI didn't complete the purchase of its initial 80.0% ownership interest in this solar facility until February 2023. WECI completed the acquisition of an additional 10.0% of Samson I in January 2024, bringing its ownership interest in Samson I to 90.0%. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information.\nBishop Hill III, Coyote Ridge, Blooming Grove, Tatanka Ridge, Jayhawk, Thunderhead, Samson I, Sapphire Sky, Maple Flats, and Delilah I have offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties for the sale of all of the energy they produce over periods \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nranging from 10 to 22 years following commercial operation. In addition, Upstream's revenue is substantially fixed over the 10-year period following commercial operation through an agreement with a creditworthy counterparty. Under the Tax Legislation, all of these investments qualify for PTCs. WECI is entitled to the tax benefits of Bishop Hill III, Upstream, Blooming Grove, Thunderhead, Samson I, Sapphire Sky, Maple Flats, and Delilah I in proportion to its ownership interest. WECI is entitled to 99% of the tax benefits of Coyote Ridge and Tatanka Ridge for the first 11 years following commercial operation, and is entitled to 99% of the tax benefits of Jayhawk for the first 10 years following commercial operation, after which WECI will be entitled to any tax benefits from these three facilities in proportion to its ownership interests. WECI recognizes PTCs as power is generated over a period of 10 years following commercial operation. Under the IRA transferability option, WEC Energy Group sold substantially all of its 2023 generated PTCs, including those generated by WECI, to a third party. In addition, WEC Energy Group has entered into agreements to sell substantially all of its 2024 generated PTCs and the majority of the PTCs expected to be generated in 2025, including PTCs generated by WECI, to third parties. See Note 1(q), Income Taxes, for more information about the impact of these sales. See Note 25, Supplemental Cash Flow Information, for more information on proceeds received in 2024 and 2023 related to the sale of PTCs.\nIn February 2025, WECI completed the acquisition of a 90.0% ownership interest in Hardin III, a 250 MW solar generating facility located in Hardin County, Ohio. The project has an offtake agreement for all of the energy to be produced by the facility for a period of 15 years from the date of commercial operation. Hardin III qualifies for PTCs and is included in the non-utility energy infrastructure segment.\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on certain of these renewable generating facilities.\nSeasonality\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by our wind generating facilities depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable. Operating results for wind generating facilities vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. Historically, wind production has been greater in the first and fourth quarters.\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by solar generating facilities is also variable and depends heavily on seasonality and weather conditions. Spring and summer are usually the peak solar production seasons due to increased direct sunlight and longer days. With regards to weather, solar panels will still work on cloudy and rainy days, but solar system output will be lower than on clear, sunny days. Also, major storms can damage solar panels and other equipment and lead to lower power generation until equipment can be repaired or replaced and brought back online. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the wind storms that damaged equipment at Samson I.\nCorporate and Other Segment\nThe corporate and other segment includes the operations of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, and the PELLC holding company, as well as the operations of Wispark and WBS. Wispark develops and invests in real estate, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin. WBS is a wholly owned centralized service company that provides administrative and general support services to our regulated entities. WBS also provides certain administrative and support services to our nonregulated entities. This segment also includes Wisvest, WECC, and PDL which no longer have significant operations.\nE. REGULATION\nWe are a holding company and are subject to the requirements of the PUHCA 2005. We also have various subsidiaries that meet the definition of a holding company under the PUHCA 2005 and are also subject to its requirements.\nPursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power and the other assets in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. We report to the PSCW annually on our compliance with this law and provide supporting documentation to show that our non-utility assets are below the non-utility asset cap.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nRegulated Utility Operations\nIn addition to the specific regulations noted above and below, our utilities are subject to various other regulations, which primarily consist of regulations, where applicable, of the EPA; the WDNR; the Illinois Department of Natural Resources; the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy; the Michigan Department of Natural Resources; the United States Army Corps of Engineers; the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. \nRates\nOur utilities' rates are subject to the regulations and oversight of various state regulatory commissions and the FERC, as applicable. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The following table compares our utility operating revenues by regulatory jurisdiction for each of the three years ended December 31:\n\n                                                                                          2024                                                      2023                                                      2022\n(in millions)                                                Amount                    Percent                         Amount                    Percent                         Amount                    Percent\nElectric                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nWisconsin                                             $4,496.0                       91.3    %                  $4,548.8                       90.8    %                  $4,360.9                       87.7    %\nMichigan                                                 141.1                        2.9    %                     141.4                        2.8    %                     185.9                        3.7    %\nFERC – Wholesale                                         284.5                        5.8    %                     320.6                        6.4    %                     425.0                        8.6    %\nTotal electric                                         4,921.6                      100.0    %                   5,010.8                      100.0    %                   4,971.8                      100.0    %\nNatural Gas                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWisconsin                                              1,405.4                       40.6    %                   1,610.5                       43.6    %                   1,983.0                       44.1    %\nIllinois                                               1,602.4                       46.3    %                   1,557.8                       42.2    %                   1,890.9                       42.0    %\nMinnesota                                                290.5                        8.4    %                     348.4                        9.4    %                     400.7                        8.9    %\nMichigan                                                 162.8                        4.7    %                     175.3                        4.8    %                     223.5                        5.0    %\nTotal natural gas                                      3,461.1                      100.0    %                   3,692.0                      100.0    %                   4,498.1                      100.0    %\nTotal utility operating revenues                      $8,382.7                                                  $8,702.8                                                  $9,469.9                                \nRetail Rates\nThe state regulatory commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions including, but not limited to, approval of retail utility rates and standards of service, mergers, affiliate transactions, location and construction of electric generating units and natural gas facilities, and certain other additions and extensions to utility facilities. The PSCW, ICC, and MPUC also regulate security issuances at utilities in their respective jurisdictions. In addition, the FERC regulates security issuances for UMERC.\nHistorically, retail rates approved by the state commissions have been designed to provide utilities the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, along with a return on investment sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction. WE, WPS, and WG are each subject to an earnings sharing mechanism in which a portion of the utility's earnings are required to be refunded to customers if the utility earns above its authorized ROE. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on these earnings sharing mechanisms.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nThe table below reflects the various state commissions that regulated each of our utilities' retail rates during 2024, along with the approved ROE and capital structure for each utility during 2024.\n\nRegulated Retail Rates                             Regulatory Commission             Authorized ROE        Average Common Equity Component\nWE – Electric, natural gas, and steam              PSCW                                       9.80%                                  53.0%\nWPS – Electric and natural gas                     PSCW                                       9.80%                                  53.0%\nWG – Natural gas                                   PSCW                                       9.80%                                  53.0%\nUMERC – Electric (former WE customers) (1)         MPSC                                       10.1%                                  55.3%\nUMERC – Electric (former WPS customers) (1)        MPSC                                       10.2%                                 52.94%\nPGL – Natural gas                                  ICC                                        9.38%                                 50.79%\nNSG – Natural gas (2)                              ICC                                9.67% / 9.38%                        51.58% / 52.58%\nMERC – Natural gas (3)                             MPUC                                       9.65%                                  53.0%\nMGU – Natural gas (4)                              MPSC                                       9.80%                                  51.0%\n(1)    Effective January 1, 2025, UMERC's electric base rates for non-mine customers reflect a 9.86% authorized ROE and an average common equity component of 50.0%. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n(2)    Effective February 1, 2024, NSG's base rates reflect a 9.38% authorized ROE and an average common equity component of 52.58%. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n(3)    MERC's final rates approved by the MPUC in November 2023 were retroactive to January 1, 2023. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n(4)    Effective January 1, 2025, MGU's base rates reflect a 9.86% authorized ROE and an average common equity component of 50.0%. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nIn addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, our utilities have certain recovery mechanisms in place that allow them to recover or refund prudently incurred costs that differ from those approved in base rates.\nEmbedded within our electric utilities' rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require a utility to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of the utility's symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of the utility's approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. The deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If the utility's ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which the utility's return exceeds the authorized amount. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers.\nOur natural gas utilities operate under GCRMs as approved by their respective state regulator. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs.\nSee Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for additional information on the significant mechanisms our utilities had in place during 2024 that allowed them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts.\nOur utilities file periodic requests with their respective state commission for changes in retail rates. All of our utilities' rate requests are based on forward looking test years, which reflect additions to infrastructure and changes in costs incurred or expected to be incurred. For information on our regulatory proceedings, see Note 26, Regulatory Environment. Orders from our respective regulators can be viewed at the following websites:\n\nRegulatory Commission         Website                          \nPSCW                          https://psc.wi.gov/              \nICC                           https://www.icc.illinois.gov/    \nMPSC                          http://www.michigan.gov/mpsc/    \nMPUC                          http://mn.gov/puc/               \nThe material and information contained on these websites are not intended to be a part of, nor are they incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nWholesale Rates\nThe FERC regulates our wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services. Our electric utilities have received market-based rate authority from the FERC. Market-based rate authority allows wholesale electric sales to be made in the MISO market and directly to third parties based on the negotiated market value of the transaction. WE and WPS also make wholesale sales pursuant to cost-based formula rates. Cost-based formula rates provide for recovery of the utility's costs and an approved rate of return. The predetermined formula is initially based on the utility's expenses from the previous year, but is eventually trued up to reflect actual, current-year costs.\nElectric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets\nIn connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO operates an energy and ancillary services market and manages the flow of high-voltage electricity across the transmission system in its region. MISO is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the electric transmission system in its footprint.\nIn MISO, transmission costs are allocated in accordance with the MISO tariff, which is reviewed and approved by the FERC. Base transmission costs are paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. Costs for new regional transmission projects are allocated to load-serving entities throughout the MISO footprint, while the costs for new generation interconnections are allocated to the interconnection customer.\nWithin MISO, transmission congestion is monetized and included within an LMP that is established through the energy market. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2024, through May 31, 2025. The resulting ARR allocation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.\nMISO has seasonal zonal resource adequacy requirements to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve load within each zone and the MISO footprint. To meet this requirement, load-serving entities can own generation and demand response resources, acquire generation capacity through MISO's annual capacity auction, or acquire generation capacity through bilateral contracts. The zone in which our electric utilities’ load resides, along with the MISO North region as a whole, has sufficient generation capacity resources to meet their respective planning reserve margins for the period between June 1, 2024 and May 31, 2025. \nWe manage our electric generation portfolios to minimize their exposure within MISO’s annual capacity auction. This includes managing the retirement of existing generation resources and the addition of new generation resources to maintain a diversified portfolio to help avoid a significant short position.\nOther Electric Regulations\nOur electric utilities are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. Among other things, the Federal Power Act makes electric utility industry consolidation more feasible and authorizes the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities. The FERC also oversees the Electric Reliability Organization, which establishes mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.\nWE and WPS are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin, and UMERC is subject to Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation.\nOther Natural Gas Regulations\nAlmost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services, including PGL's natural gas hub, are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the PHMSA and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas utilities' safety compliance programs for our pipelines under the United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nWe also continue to monitor the progress of the PHMSA’s proposed rulemaking titled \"Gas Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair,\" which could have a significant impact on our natural gas utilities.\nWe are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territories. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to low-income customers of our utilities.\nNon-Utility Energy Infrastructure Operations\nThe generation facilities constructed by wholly owned subsidiaries of We Power are being leased on a long-term basis to WE. Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, WE. We Power received determinations from the FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to WE, We Power's subsidiaries would not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus would not be subject to the FERC's jurisdiction.\nBluewater is regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the PHMSA is responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing Bluewater's safety compliance programs for its pipelines under the United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Parts 191, 192, and 195. Given that Bluewater is required to route some of its natural gas through Canada, applicable reporting and licensing with the DOE and the Canadian National Energy Board are also required, along with routine reporting related to imports and exports.\nAll of our operational renewable generating facilities in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment are also subject to the FERC’s regulation of wholesale energy under the Federal Power Act. \nCompliance Costs\nThe regulations and oversight described above significantly influence our operating environment, and may cause us to incur compliance and other related costs and may affect our ability to recover these costs from our utility customers. Any anticipated capital expenditures for compliance with government regulations for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Requirements.\nF. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE\nOur operations, especially as they relate to our coal-fired generating facilities, are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation related to GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, water use, or wastewater discharges and other climate change issues, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.\nAnticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash Requirements. For a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change, see Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies.\nG. HUMAN CAPITAL\nWe believe our employees are among our most important resources, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. We strive to attract, retain, and develop talented personnel and keep our employees safe, healthy, and engaged.\nOur Board of Directors retains collective responsibility for comprehensive risk oversight, including critical areas that could impact our sustainability, such as human capital. Management regularly reports to the Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, succession planning, training and employee development, and safety and health. The Board of Directors \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \ndelegates specified duties to its committees. In addition to its responsibilities relative to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing organizational matters that could significantly impact us. The Compensation Committee reviews recruiting and development programs and priorities, receives updates on key talent, and assesses workforce composition across the organization.\nWorkforce\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had the following number of employees, including those represented under union agreements:\n\n                                       Total Employees                  Union Employees\nWE                                       2,497                            1,923        \nWPS                                      1,180                              850        \nWG                                         387                              270        \nPGL                                      1,213                              847        \nNSG                                        144                              108        \nMERC                                       199                               38        \nMGU                                        142                               92        \nWBS                                      1,255                                —        \nTotal employees                          7,017                            4,128        \nWe have a local union presence that spans Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan. We believe we have very good overall relations with our workforce.\nIn order to attract and retain talent, we provide competitive wages and benefits to our employees based on their performance, role, location, and market data. Our compensation package also includes a 401(k) savings plan with an employer match, an annual incentive plan based on meeting company goals, healthcare and insurance benefits, vacation and paid time off days, as well as other benefits.\nEngagement\nWe are committed to ensuring a fair workplace and an engaged workforce. Our commitment is a core strategic competency and an integral part of our culture, with longstanding programs for individual development, reinforcement of our core values, and a recruitment strategy that is focused on building a deep talent pipeline to support our business needs. During 2024, we demonstrated this commitment through training and development of employees at all levels of the organization, our comprehensive merit review and succession planning processes, and a range of community partnerships. In addition, we have a number of initiatives that promote workforce contributions and participation and ensure our companies are attractive employers for persons of all backgrounds. These initiatives include nine business resource groups (voluntary, employee-led groups organized around a particular shared background or interest), mentoring programs, and education and training for all employees in order to develop and support inclusive teams. We are committed to a workplace free from bias and harassment. We also support external leadership and educational programs that support, train, and promote individuals in the communities we serve.\nSafety and Health\nOur Executive Safety Committee directs our safety and health strategy, works to ensure consistency across groups, and reinforces our ongoing safety commitment that we refer to as “Target Zero.” Under our Target Zero commitment, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. Our corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus. We monitor and set goals for days away, restricted or transferred metrics, and measurable leading indicators, which together raise awareness about employee safety and guide injury-prevention activities.\nWe also provide employees various benefits and resources designed to promote healthy living, both at work and at home. We encourage employees to receive preventive examinations and to proactively care for their health through free health screenings, wellness challenges, and other resources. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nDevelopment and Training\nEmployee training and development of both technical and leadership skills are integral aspects of our human capital strategy. We provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including online training, simulations, live classes, and mentoring to assist with their career advancement. These programs include safety and technical job skill training as well as soft-skill programs focused on relevant subjects, including communication and change management. Development of leadership skills remains a top priority and is specialized for all levels of employees. We have specific leadership programs for aspiring leaders and new supervisors, managers, and directors. This development of our employees is an integral part of our succession planning and provides continuity for our senior leadership.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.",

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this report and other documents filed by us with the SEC from time to time, when making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Regulation\nOur business is significantly impacted by governmental regulation and oversight.\nWe are subject to significant state, local, and federal governmental regulations, including regulations by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. These regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. Changes in regulations, interpretations of regulations, or the imposition of new regulations could also significantly impact us, including requiring us to change our business operations. Many aspects of our operations are regulated and impacted by government regulation, including, but not limited to: the rates we charge our retail electric, natural gas, and steam customers; the authorized rates of return of our utilities; construction and operation of electric generating facilities and electric and natural gas distribution systems, including the ability to recover such costs; decommissioning generating facilities, the ability to recover the related costs, and continuing to recover the return on the net book value of these facilities; wholesale power service practices; electric reliability requirements; participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market; standards of service; issuance of securities; short-term debt obligations; transactions with affiliates; and billing practices. Failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to customer refunds, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe rates, including adjustments determined under riders, we are allowed to charge our customers for retail and wholesale services have the most significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Rate regulation provides us an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent upon regulatory action, the outcome of which can be influenced by the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; and changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments. There is no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred. In addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide for a reasonable ROE. We defer certain costs and revenues as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery from or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is subject to review and approval by our regulators. If recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nChanges in the local and national political, regulatory, and economic environment have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on regulatory decisions, which could impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers. These decisions, which may come from any level of government, may cause us to cancel or delay current or planned projects, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures, or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that our utilities may not be able to recover through rates or otherwise. In its November 2023 final rate orders for PGL and NSG, the ICC disallowed certain previously incurred capital costs, which resulted in PGL and NSG recording impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2023, and caused PGL to pause spending on its SMP. After a limited rehearing, the ICC issued a written order in May 2024 approving additional spending for emergency work related to SMP projects. PGL and NSG have appealed the orders to the Illinois Appellate Court. On February 20, 2025, the ICC issued an order setting expectations for PGL's prospective operations under its SMP. The ICC directed us to focus on replacing all cast and ductile iron pipe that has a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035. The ICC also indicated that failure to comply with this directive could subject us to civil penalties under Illinois statute. As a result of these proceedings and order, the recovery of existing and future investments in capital expenditures and our natural gas infrastructure in Illinois is uncertain and future capital plans may be impacted. \nPrior to its expiration in December 2023, the QIP rider provided PGL with recovery of, and a return on, qualifying natural gas infrastructure investments that were placed in service between regulatory rate reviews. Due to the expiration of the QIP rider, PGL included the costs of necessary infrastructure improvements related to the SMP in its rate case, thereby subjecting the recovery of these costs to regulatory lag. In its August 2024 final order on PGL's 2016 annual reconciliation, the ICC disallowed certain capital costs, which resulted in PGL recording a pre-tax charge to income during the third quarter of 2024 related to the disallowance and the previously recognized return on these investments. This rider continues to be subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. There can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the QIP rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2017 through 2023, will be deemed recoverable by the ICC. The risk of costs being deemed \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nunrecoverable during the review of the outstanding reconciliations, could have a material adverse impact on PGL’s, and correspondingly our, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nWe believe we have obtained the necessary permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses for our existing operations, have complied in all material respects with all of their associated terms, and that our businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. These permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. Licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal, state, and local agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. We cannot predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies. \nIf we are unable to recover costs of complying with regulations or other associated costs in customer rates in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain, renew, or comply with these governmental permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, or licenses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. \nOur operations are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements related to, among other things, air emissions (including, but not limited to: CO2, methane, mercury, SO2, and NOx), protection of natural resources, water quality, wastewater discharges, and management of hazardous and toxic substances and solid wastes and soils. The EPA has recently adopted and implemented new environmental regulations, which include regulations that govern the emission of NOx, ozone, fine particulates, and other air pollutants under the CAA through the NAAQS, climate change, other air quality regulations, and water quality regulations. For example, in 2024, the EPA revised the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants, published a final rule lowering the PM limit under the MATS, lowered the primary (health-based) annual PM 2.5 NAAQS, published the Greenhouse Gas Power Plant Rule for fossil-fired steam generating units, issued a final Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, and finalized a rule for CCR that applies to landfills, historic fill sites, and projects where CCR was placed at a power plant site. Some of these rules could be challenged or reviewed by agencies under the new presidential administration, which creates additional uncertainty. As a result of these potential challenges and reviews, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted at the federal, state, or local level. \nCertain of our service territories in Wisconsin are located in areas determined to be in \"serious\" nonattainment status under the EPA's ozone standard. This nonattainment status could affect future permitting activities for our facilities, including additional costs associated with more strenuous emission control requirements or the need to purchase emission reduction credits. In addition, economic growth in these areas may be constrained by the inability to obtain the required permits, limiting investment and expansion over the coming years, including our ability to execute on our capital plan. \nWe incur significant capital and operating resources to comply with environmental laws, regulations, and requirements, including costs associated with the installation of pollution control equipment; operating restrictions on our facilities; and environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at our facilities. The operation of emission control equipment and compliance with rules regulating our intake and discharge of water could also increase our operating costs and reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. These regulations may create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability and/or cost of fossil fuels and our ability to continue operating certain generating units. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and requirements, even if caused by factors beyond our control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. We continue to assess the potential cost of complying, and to explore different alternatives in order to comply, with these and other environmental regulations.\nAs a result of these compliance costs and other factors, certain of our coal-fired electric generating facilities have become uneconomical to maintain and operate, which has resulted in these units being retired or converted to an alternative type of fuel. As part of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we have already retired nearly 2,500 MWs of fossil-fueled generation since the beginning of 2018. We expect to retire approximately 1,200 MWs of additional coal-fired generation by the end of 2031, and plan to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning zero-carbon-emitting renewable and reliable, efficient natural gas generation facilities. We have also started implementing co-firing with natural gas at certain of our coal-fired units and are evaluating the conversion to natural gas.\nOur electric and natural gas utilities are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts at certain of our current and former facilities and at third-party owned sites. We accrue liabilities and defer \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \ncosts (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs include all costs incurred to date that we expect to recover, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation and related legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered (or that may be recovered) from insurance or other third parties. Due to the potential for the imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future, the possibility that other potentially responsible parties may not be willing or financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, a change in conditions or the discovery of additional contamination, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in the future may accelerate or could vary from the amounts currently accrued.\nLitigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, occurs frequently throughout the United States. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by GHG and other emissions and exposure to regulated substances and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. In addition to claims relating to our current facilities, we may also be subject to potential liability in connection with the environmental condition of facilities that we previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during, or after the time we owned or operated these facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause (or caused) harm to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil penalties and damages against us. The incurrence of a material environmental liability or a material judgment in any action for personal injury or property damage related to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures and related costs from our customers in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, increased costs recovered through rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur operations, capital expenditures, and financial results may be affected by the impact of greenhouse gas legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals. \nThere has been significant attention to issues concerning climate change as well as activism from certain stakeholders, including institutional investors and other sources of financing, to accelerate the transition to lower and limit GHG emissions. The EPA and some states have adopted and are implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs. There have also been increasing efforts to introduce and adopt electrification initiatives and/or mandates and other efforts to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source. \nCosts associated with such legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals could be significant within our electric and natural gas operations. New or additional GHG regulations, at either the federal or state level, may cause our environmental compliance spending to differ materially from the amounts currently estimated. There is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover costs incurred to comply with these and other federal and state regulations or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise conditioned. These regulations, as well as changes in the fuel markets and advances in technology, could make additional electric generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate, may impact how we operate our existing fossil-fueled power plants and biomass facility, and could cause us to retire and replace units earlier than planned under our capital plan, which could lead to a possible loss on abandonment and reduced revenues. \nIn a movement toward electrification, certain states and municipalities near or in our service territories have passed legislation or are considering ordinances banning natural gas used in new construction in order to limit GHG emissions. For example, the ICC is exploring the role of natural gas in the future and issues related to decarbonization of the natural gas distribution system in Illinois. There have also been efforts to restrict residential natural gas-fired appliances. Future local, statewide, or nationwide actions like these to regulate GHG emissions could increase the price of natural gas, reduce the demand for natural gas, cause us to accelerate the replacement and/or updating of our natural gas delivery systems, and adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities. A significant increase in the price of natural gas may increase rates for our natural gas customers, which could also reduce natural gas demand and revenues. The adoption of electrification initiatives and/or mandates could also result in an increase in electrical demand and increased investment costs for existing or new electrical systems. These types of initiatives and/or mandates could result in increased costs associated with permitting and siting of new technologies and delayed installation and start-up timelines. In addition, financial investments in older carbon intensive technologies may not be fully realized. \nWe have set goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 60% by the end of 2025 and by 80% by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Over the longer term, the target for our generation fleet is to be net carbon neutral by 2050. We have a goal to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2032. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nWe continue to monitor the financial and operational feasibility of taking more aggressive action to further reduce GHG emissions in order to limit future global temperature increases. We continue to focus on methane emission reductions by improving our natural gas distribution systems. We set a target across our natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. \nThe ability to achieve these reductions in CO2 and methane emissions depends on many external factors, including the ability to make operating refinements, the retirement of less efficient generating units, the development of relevant energy technologies, the use of RNG throughout our natural gas utility systems, the ability to procure RTCs, legislative and regulatory support for renewable generation, the ability to maintain reliability with demand growth, and the ability to execute our capital plan. These efforts could impact how we operate our electric generating units and natural gas facilities and lead to increased competition and regulation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. There can be no guarantee that we will achieve our targets.\nChanges in tax legislation, IRS audits, or our inability to use certain tax benefits and carryforwards, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our credit ratings.\nTax legislation and regulations can adversely affect, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and credit ratings. Future changes to corporate tax rates or policies, including under Treasury Regulations and guidance issued in connection with the IRA, could require us to take material charges against earnings. Such changes include, among other things, increasing the federal corporate income tax rate, disallowing or limiting the use of certain tax benefits and carryforwards, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. Our inability to manage these changes, an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions, or additional interpretations, implementing regulations, amendments, or technical corrections by the Treasury Department, the IRS, or state income tax authorities, could significantly impact our financial results and cash flows. \nWe have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liabilities in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions. A reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. We have not fully used these allowed tax benefits in our previous tax filings and have carried them forward to use against future taxable income. Our inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully use these tax carryforwards before they expire, or to transfer future tax credits as discussed below, could significantly affect our tax obligations and financial results.\nIn addition, we have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in renewable energy generating facilities. These facilities generate PTCs or ITCs that we can use to reduce our federal tax obligations. Under the IRA, a transferability option also allows us to sell these tax credits to third parties. This is a relatively new market that may require additional regulations and guidance from taxing authorities. The amount of tax credits we earn depends on available government incentives and policies, the amount of electricity produced, the applicable tax credit rate, or the amount of the investment in qualifying property. Any reductions or eliminations of tax credits or other governmental incentives that promote renewable energy generating facilities, including the repeal or amendment of portions of the IRA and the executive order issued by the new presidential administration, could make it less conducive for the development and operation of renewable energy facilities. In addition, a variety of operating and economic factors, including transmission constraints, adverse weather conditions, and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce the PTCs generated by the renewable projects we have invested in, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, or other assessments related to renewable energy projects or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, as well as any reductions or eliminations of tax credits or other governmental incentives that promote renewable energy generating facilities, may also limit our ability to make further investments in renewable energy generating facilities or reduce the returns on our existing investments.\nWe are also uncertain as to how credit rating agencies, capital markets, the FERC, or state public utility commissions will treat any future changes to federal or state tax legislation. These impacts could subject us to credit rating downgrades. In addition, certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted by changes in federal or state income tax legislation. \nOur electric utilities could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.\nOur electric utilities are subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nelectric utilities to higher operating costs. If our electric utilities are found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation.\nProvisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility businesses and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.\nUnder the Holding Company Act, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our diversification into non-utility businesses. Under the Holding Company Act, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates in the system, subject to certain exemptions for energy-related assets.\nIn addition, the Holding Company Act precludes the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a Wisconsin public utility unless the PSCW has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers, investors, and the public. This provision and other requirements of the Holding Company Act may delay or reduce the likelihood of a sale or change of control of WEC Energy Group. As a result, shareholders may be deprived of opportunities to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock at prices that represent a premium over market prices.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nPublic health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, could adversely affect our business functions, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nPublic health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, and any related government responses may adversely impact the economy and financial markets and could have a variety of adverse impacts on us, including a decrease in revenues; increased bad debt expense; increases in past due accounts receivable balances; and access to the capital markets at unreasonable terms or rates.\nPublic health crises and any related government responses could also impair our ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities. Risks include extended disruptions to supply chains and inflation, resulting in increased costs for labor, materials, and services, which could adversely impact our ability to implement our corporate strategy. We may also be adversely impacted by labor disruptions and productivity as a result of infections, employee attrition, and a reduced ability to replace departing employees as a result of employees who leave or forego employment to avoid any required precautionary measures.\nDespite our efforts to manage the impacts of public health crises which may occur in the future, the extent to which they may affect us depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. As a result, we are unable to determine the potential impact any such public health crises may have on our business plans and operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. \nOur operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, natural gas storage fields, renewable energy facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generation and transmission, natural gas and electric distribution facilities, natural gas storage fields, and renewable energy facilities. The operation of these facilities involves many risks, including operator error and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. \nPotential breakdown or failure may occur due to severe weather (i.e., storms, tornadoes, floods, droughts, etc.); catastrophic events (i.e., fires, earthquakes, and explosions); public health crises; significant changes in water levels in waterways; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; delays in the replacement of aging infrastructure; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; performance below expected levels; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; terrorist or other physical attacks; or cybersecurity intrusions. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses, including increased maintenance costs, unanticipated capital expenditures, and a reduction of revenues related to our non-utility renewable energy facilities. Because our electric generation and renewable energy facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. Unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues, cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. \nInsurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nThe operations of our natural gas utilities depend upon the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas. \nOur natural gas utilities purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to our natural gas utilities’ systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze-off of natural gas wells, terrorist or physical attacks, cyberattacks, other acts of war, or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change or other environmental matters, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby significantly disrupt our operations and/or reduce earnings. \nOur operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in energy sales to customers, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas, varying weather conditions, and energy conservation efforts.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon:\n•Fluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas. Customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as economic factors in our service territories, including workforce reductions, stagnant wage growth, changing levels of support from state and local government for economic development, business closings, and reductions in the level of business investment. Our electric and natural gas utilities are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. Any economic downturn, disruption of financial markets, or reduced incentives by state government for economic development could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products or services. These risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. We could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills.\n•Weather conditions. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months when cooling and heating is necessary. In addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. As a result, our overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, milder temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter heating season may result in lower revenues and net income.\n•Our customers' continued focus on energy conservation. Our customers' use of electricity and natural gas has decreased as a result of continued individual conservation efforts, including the use of more energy efficient technologies, and could be further reduced by new building codes, DERs, energy storage technology, and private solar. Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income and increases in energy prices. Conservation of energy can be influenced by certain federal and state programs that are intended to influence how consumers use energy. For example, several states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have adopted energy efficiency targets to reduce energy consumption. \nAs part of our planning process, we estimate the impacts of changes in customer growth and general economic conditions, weather, and customer energy conservation efforts, but risks still remain. The growth of data centers and development of associated technology may make it more difficult to accurately forecast customer demand or to recover additional costs. Any of these matters, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates as a result of reduced sales from effective conservation measures or the adoption of new technologies, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, elimination or reduced financial support of programs that provide energy assistance to our customers, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, could impact the demand for energy and/or adversely impact our liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to the effects of global climate change.\nA changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur that result in extreme temperatures in our service territories, our financial results could be adversely impacted by lower electric and natural gas usage and higher natural gas costs. An extreme weather event could result in downed wires and poles, as well as damage to wind and solar generation facilities, or other operating equipment. This could result in us incurring significant restoration costs at our utilities and/or at WECI, and foregoing sales of energy and lost revenues. Extreme weather in summer could cause electric load to be interrupted or certain customers to be curtailed who participate in load management programs. Additionally, an extreme weather event could also cause the cost of natural gas purchased for our natural gas utility customers and for the use of fuel at our generation facilities to be temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nwinter weather expectations. Although our utilities have regulatory mechanisms in place for recovering all prudently incurred natural gas costs, our regulators could disallow recovery or order the refund of any costs determined to be imprudent. \nIn addition, our operations could be adversely affected and our facilities placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, which could result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, such as storms, including derecho events, with high winds, lightning, and hail, floods, drought, wild fires, tornadoes, snow and ice storms, or abnormal levels of precipitation. Extreme weather may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring us to procure additional power at wholesale prices for our retail operations, unpredictable curtailment of customer load by MISO to maintain grid reliability, or other grid reliability issues. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses including increased maintenance costs, unanticipated capital expenditures, or a reduction of revenues related to our non-utility renewable energy facilities. The cost of storm restoration efforts may also not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.\nOur corporate strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to lower GHG emissions. In addition, changes in policy to combat climate change, including mitigation and adaptation efforts, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to lower emissions, may materially adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows through significant capital expenditures and investments in renewable generation.\nOur operations and future results may be impacted by changing expectations and demands of our customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders.\nOur ability to execute our strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of affordability and reliability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers’ sustainability goals and energy needs, as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures may impact our reputation and affect our ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases or our results of operations. The new presidential administration's efforts to roll back certain climate and diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and programs may conflict with the expectations of our customers, regulators, and investors, creating additional uncertainty as we look to balance our stakeholders' competing priorities, and could lead to litigation and government investigations. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nAs it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. \nOur operations and corporate strategy may be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions and inflation.\nOur business is dependent on the global supply chain to ensure that equipment, materials, and other resources are available to both expand and maintain services in a safe and reliable manner. Protracted, expanding or escalating regional or international conflicts, including the conflicts involving Ukraine, Israel, and parts of the Middle East, as well as strained relationships between the United States and other countries related to such conflicts, could result in domestic and global supply chain disruptions that delay the delivery, or result in shortages of, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to our business operations. Failure to eliminate or manage the constraints in the supply chain may eventually impact the availability of items that are necessary to support normal operations as well as materials that are required to implement our corporate strategy for continued utility and infrastructure growth, including our renewable energy projects. \nMoreover, prices of equipment, materials, and other resources have increased as a result of supply chain disruptions and may continue to increase in the future, as a result of inflation. Increases in inflation raise our costs for labor, materials, and services, and failure to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates to account for increased costs, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. \nIn addition, the imposition of new tariffs, or other changes in United States trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. A “trade war” of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to result in or exacerbate global supply chain disruptions and/or inflation, which could result in an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition, and/or capital plan.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nWe are actively involved with multiple significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas and LNG storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We also expect to continue constructing and investing in renewable energy and natural gas generating facilities as part of our capital plan and our goal to be net carbon neutral by 2050. In addition, we continue to invest in technology and the development of software applications to support our businesses. \nAchieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties, some of which we will have limited or no control over, that could adversely affect project costs and completion time. Supply chain disruptions, including solar panel shortages and delays, increasing material costs, government tariffs, and other factors, could impact the timing of completion of our renewable projects. For example, the UFLPA's prohibition on imports of solar panels manufactured with certain silica-based products originating in Xinjiang, China, has and could delay the release of solar panels to us for our renewables projects. Additional risks include, but are not limited to, the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames; the availability of labor or materials at estimated costs; the ability of contractors to perform under their contracts; strikes; adverse weather conditions; potential legal challenges; changes in applicable laws or regulations; rising interest rates; inflation; tariffs; the impact of public health crises; other governmental actions; continued public and policymaker support for such projects; and events in the global economy. \nCertain of these projects require the approval of our regulators. If construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and/or projections on which the approval was based, our regulators may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and disallow recovery of them through rates, and otherwise available PTCs and ITCs for renewable energy projects could be lost or lose value. Efforts to pause approvals related to wind development could threaten our ability to execute our capital plan. Other renewable energy sources, including solar developments, could also be at risk. In addition, regulators, in a future rate proceeding, may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed, such as was the case in the ICC's November 2023 rate orders for PGL and NSG.\nOur subsidiaries sometimes incur significant engineering, design, and equipment costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. We may not be allowed to recover these penalties and other costs incurred in customer rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if any construction work or investments have already been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded. Despite mitigation efforts we have undertaken, we may still experience significant losses or delayed recovery of these costs.\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, tax credits are lost or lose value, or we or third parties with whom we invest and/or partner otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cybersecurity intrusions, terrorist or other physical attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.\nWe have been subject to attempted cyber attacks from time to time, and will likely continue to be subject to such attempted attacks; however, these prior attacks have not had a material impact on our system or business operations. All of our assets and systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to physical or cybersecurity intrusions caused by human error, vendor bugs, terrorist or other physical attacks (including potential attacks on our substations and other electric distribution equipment), acts of war, or other malicious acts. Cybersecurity threats could result in a full or partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. If our assets or systems were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached, and were not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions, and data, including sensitive information, could be compromised. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks targeting utility systems and other critical infrastructure, may increase during periods of heightened or escalating geopolitical tensions.\nWe operate in an industry that requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which in turn control an interconnected network of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. A successful physical or cybersecurity intrusion may occur despite our security measures or those we require of our vendors, including compliance with reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards. Successful cybersecurity intrusions, including those \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \ntargeting the electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage systems, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. Attacks may come through ransomware, software updates or patches, or firmware that hackers can manipulate. These intrusions may cause unplanned outages at our power plants, which may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. The risk of such intrusions may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure. \nOur continued efforts to integrate, consolidate, and streamline our operations have also resulted in increased reliance on current and recently completed projects for technology systems. The failure to enhance existing information technology systems and adopt or successfully implement new technology could adversely affect our operations. Cybersecurity threats, including those leveraging AI, continue to increase, and the security measures and preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cybersecurity incidents and protect our systems against unauthorized access to secured data and systems may be insufficient to safeguard against all security breaches. The failure of any of these important technologies, or our inability to support, update, expand, and/or integrate these technologies across our subsidiaries, could materially and adversely impact our operations, diminish customer confidence and our reputation, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. In some cases, we rely on third-party hosted services to support our business operations. Malicious actors may target these providers to disrupt the services they provide to us, or to use those third parties to attack us. Security breaches of our or our third-party service providers' systems may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or could cause us to become subject to significant litigation, costs, liability, fines, or penalties, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations as well as our reputation with customers, shareholders, and regulators, among others. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with governmental actions in response to such intrusions or to strengthen our information and electronic control systems. We may also need to obtain additional insurance coverage related to the threat of such intrusions.\nThreats to our systems and operations continue to emerge as new ways to compromise components into our systems or networks are developed. Any operational disruption or environmental repercussions caused by on-going or future threats to our assets and technology systems could result in a significant decrease in our revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The costs of repairing damage to our facilities, operational disruptions, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may also not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance. \nAdoption of AI technologies could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe are using AI primarily through services provided by our third party vendors. In addition, we are exploring the use of AI, including generative AI, and its ability to enhance the services we offer. There are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI, and there can be no assurance that the use of AI will enhance our services or be beneficial to our business, including with respect to the efficiency and resiliency of our systems. Our AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to accuracy, bias, discrimination, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy, and cybersecurity, among others. In addition, the adoption of AI may subject us to new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, laws, rules, directives, or regulations governing the use of AI, as well as litigation, ethical concerns, negative customer perceptions as to automation and AI, legal liability or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. We may not be able to recover our investments in AI technology through our regulatory proceedings. Similarly, as AI continues to evolve, we may not be able to adopt and implement AI as quickly as our customers or communities desire or regulators may require. AI is a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology, and we are unable to predict all of the risks that may result from our and our vendors' adoption of AI initiatives.\nAdvances in technology, and legislation or regulations supporting such technology, could make our electric generating facilities less competitive and may impact the demand for natural gas.\nAdvances in new technologies that produce or store power or reduce power consumption are ongoing and include renewable energy technologies, customer-oriented generation, energy storage devices, and energy efficiency technologies. We generate power at central station power plants and utility-scale renewable generation facilities to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. Distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, solar \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \ncells, and related energy storage devices, have technologically improved and have become more cost competitive than they were in the past. \nRecent legislation, including the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, has promoted the construction and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy generation, including distributed generation technologies for self-supply of electricity by our customers and third parties. Increased use of technologies such as private solar and battery storage in our service territories could reduce our recovery of fixed costs, could result in customers leaving the electric distribution system, and could cause an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies could result in our electric utilities not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. \nFederal and state regulations and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of distributed generation technologies also incentivize modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid's capacity to interconnect to these distributed generation technologies. Other legislation or regulations could be adopted supporting the use of these technologies at below cost or that permit third-party sales from such facilities, and allow these facilities to interconnect to our distribution system. There is also a risk that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station and utility-scale renewable power production. In addition, regulatory support of co-locating generation near data centers could impact our generation planning and its related cost recovery and could cause our generation to be less cost effective. \nWe also cannot predict the effect that development of alternative energy sources or new technology may have on our natural gas operations, including whether subsidies of alternative energy sources by local, state, and federal governments might be expanded, or what impact this might have on the supply of or the demand for natural gas.\nIf these technologies become cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, our market share could be eroded, and the value of our generating facilities and natural gas distribution systems could be reduced. Advances in technology, or changes in legislation or regulations, could also change the channels through which our customers purchase or use power and natural gas, which could reduce our sales and revenues or increase our expenses.\nWe generate and distribute electricity and transport, distribute, and store natural gas, which involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nInherent in electric generation and distribution and natural gas transportation, distribution, and storage activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, mechanical problems, fires, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and other environmental risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and/or administrative proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, or be resolved on unfavorable terms. Further, delays in the replacement of aging infrastructure as a result of the ICC's orders in the 2023 PGL and NSG rate cases, as well as the ICC's decision in PGL's 2016 QIP rider reconciliation proceeding, may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could also negatively impact our financial results. \nWe face risks related to our non-utility renewable energy facilities that could impact our return on investment or have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe production of energy from wind and solar sites depends heavily on suitable weather conditions, which are variable. Wind conditions or solar irradiance that is unfavorable or below our estimates can cause electricity production, and therefore revenues and PTCs earned from non-utility renewable energy facilities, to be substantially below our expectations. We based our decisions about which sites to acquire and operate in part on the findings of studies of long-term meteorological data in the proposed area. Actual conditions at these sites, however, may not conform to the results of these studies. \nOur renewable sites may experience performance issues and production shutdowns as a result of the quality of the wind turbine and solar panel components used in construction, as well as due to the availability of replacement parts. In addition, an increase in frequency and severity of weather conditions could cause disruptions to our sites to become more frequent and severe. Wind and solar equipment can be damaged by natural events such as lightning strikes that damage blades or in-ground systems used to collect electricity from turbines or panels. Sites also may experience production shutdowns or delayed restoration of production during \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nextreme weather conditions resulting in, among other things, damage to solar panels, icing on wind turbine blades, or restricted access to sites. The costs of repairing damage to these facilities may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies or may be outside the coverage afforded by our insurance policies. In addition, significant repair costs and/or continuous damage events could cause our insurance premiums to increase or lead to insurance coverage not being available at all. Damage to renewable facilities could also reduce operating capacity and cause the declaration of force majeure events. Customers may raise objections to force majeure declarations for these or similar operating issues. The failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under the PPAs could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.\nLower wholesale market prices for electricity may adversely affect the financial results for certain of our renewable projects, depending on the structure of the related PPA. In addition, lower prices for other energy sources may reduce the demand for wind and solar energy development, which could adversely affect our growth prospects and financial condition. Wind and solar energy demand is affected by the price and availability of other fuels, including nuclear, coal, natural gas and oil, as well as other sources of renewable energy. Reduced government incentives for wind and solar energy, increases in operating and maintenance costs, new regulations, or incentives that favor other forms of energy could reduce the demand for renewable energy and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not own all the property and other sites on which our projects are located. Projects may be located on property or other sites occupied under long-term easements, leases, and rights of way. The ownership interests on these properties may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens and other easements, lease rights, and rights of way of third parties that were created previously. As a result, some of our real property rights may be subordinate to the rights of third parties, and the rights of our operating subsidiaries to use the property could be lost or curtailed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial conditions.\nWe have entered into long-term PPAs for the majority of our non-utility renewable energy operations with a small number of customers where their payment is based on the energy produced, and in some cases the REC value created, by our facilities. Although initial agreements are often ten years or more, in the future we may not be able to replace expiring PPAs related to our non-utility renewable energy facilities with contracts on acceptable terms, including at prices that support profitable operation of the facility. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity supplied by traditional utilities or the pricing of other clean energy sources in the regions where our non-utility renewable energy facilities are located could harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and to sign PPAs with customers. If we are unable to replace an expiring PPA with an acceptable new revenue contract, we may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. If we are unable to replace an expired distributed generation PPA with an acceptable new contract, we may be required to remove the renewable energy facility from the site or, alternatively, we may have to sell the assets, but the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the renewable energy facility. \nFor some of our PPAs, the net amount paid by our PPA counterparties is impacted by wholesale prices at a market hub location different from the location of our renewable site. Systemic shortfalls and disruptions in transmission capacity can cause congestion between the two locations, which along with other factors, can cause price disparity between the market hub and site. This price disparity, known as basis risk, can be significant at times. We attempt to mitigate basis risk where possible, but hedging instruments are often not economically feasible or available in the quantities that we require. Basis risk cannot be entirely eliminated and can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur non-utility renewable energy facilities are exposed to risks through participation in various regional power markets. Our ability to acquire new non-utility renewable energy facilities or generate revenue from existing facilities depends on having interconnection arrangements with transmission providers and power markets along with a reliable grid. We cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate or increase competitive access to those markets. If a transmission network to which one or more of our facilities is connected experiences down time for system emergencies, force majeure, safety, reliability, maintenance or other operational reasons, we may lose revenues and PTCs and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from our customers. Curtailment of our non-utility renewable energy facilities may result in a reduced return on our investments, and we may not be compensated for lost energy and ancillary services. As members of these RTOs, we are also subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation of losses among existing members caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases seeking refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets. Existing, new, or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs for participation, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design. In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion, and firm transmission rights. \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nWe are a holding company and rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.\nAs a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to meet our financial obligations including, but not limited to, debt service, taxes, and other expenses, as well as pay dividends on our common stock, is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us, whether through dividends or other payments. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not required to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us depends on their earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, and general financial condition, as well as regulatory limitations. Prior to distributing cash to us, our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay amounts to us depends on any statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual restrictions and limitations applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain specified levels of debt or equity ratios, working capital, or other assets. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met.\nWe may fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce. \nWe operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Failure to hire and obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur counterparties may fail to meet their obligations, including obligations under power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, and transportation agreements. \nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform or if capacity is inadequate, we may be required to replace the underlying commitment at current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our customers' electric and natural gas requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. In such event, we may incur losses, and our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into several power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, and transportation agreements with non-affiliated companies. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the counterparties of their obligations under these agreements. Although we have a comprehensive credit evaluation process and contractual protections, it is possible that one or more counterparties could fail to perform their obligations. If this were to occur, we generally would expect that any operating and other costs that were initially allocated to a defaulting customer's power purchase, natural gas supply, natural gas pipeline capacity, or transportation agreement would be reallocated among our retail customers. To the extent these costs are not allowed to be reallocated by our regulators or there is any regulatory delay in adjusting rates, a counterparty default under these agreements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Volatility\nOur business is dependent on our ability to successfully access credit and capital markets on competitive terms and rates.\nWe rely on access to credit and capital markets to support our capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. In addition, we rely on committed bank credit agreements as back-up liquidity, which allows us to access the low cost commercial paper markets. The availability of credit depends upon the ability of banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systemic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the credit agreements. \nSuccessful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. Continued elevation of, or further increases in, interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nearn their approved rates of return. High interest rates may also impair our ability to cost-effectively finance capital expenditures and to refinance maturing debt. \nOur access to the credit and capital markets could be limited, or our cost of capital significantly increased, due to any of the following risks and uncertainties:\n•A rating downgrade;\n•Failure to comply with debt covenants;\n•An economic downturn or uncertainty;\n•Prevailing market conditions and rules;\n•Political tensions, including civil unrest and election volatility;\n•Concerns over foreign economic conditions;\n•Changes in tax policy;\n•Changes in investment criteria of institutional investors or banks, including any policies that would limit or restrict funding for companies with fossil fuel-related investments;\n•War or the threat of war; and\n•The overall health and view of the utility and financial institution industries. \nIf any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, and could limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level. \nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or require the posting of collateral.\nThere are a number of factors that impact our credit ratings, including, but not limited to, capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other requirements for capital. We could experience a downgrade in ratings if the rating agencies determine that our level of business or financial risk, or that of any of our utilities or the utility industry, has deteriorated. Changes in rating methodologies by the rating agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. Any downgrade by the rating agencies could increase borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities or future financings, decrease funding sources, limit the availability of adequate credit support for our operations, and trigger collateral requirements in various contracts.\nThe fluctuation in demand for certain commodities and their respective prices could negatively impact our operations.\nOur operating and liquidity requirements are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services. \nOur electric utilities burn natural gas in several of their electric generation plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants. In many instances the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. The cost of natural gas may increase because of disruptions in the supply of natural gas due to a curtailment in production or distribution, international market conditions, the demand for natural gas, and the availability of shale gas and potential regulations and/or other government action affecting its accessibility. Our electric utilities also burn coal at certain of their electric generation facilities. We may be obligated to pay for coal deliveries under our contracts even if our coal-fired generating facilities do not operate enough to fully utilize the amounts of coal covered by the contracts. \nFor Wisconsin retail electric customers, our utilities bear the risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs within a symmetrical 2% fuel tolerance band compared to the forecast of fuel and purchased power costs established in their respective rate structures. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas utilities receive dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs from their natural gas customers. \nChanges in the demand for commodities and their respective prices could result in:\n•Higher working capital requirements, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings;\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \n•Reduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, higher fuel costs, increased bad debt, and higher interest expense are not recovered through rates;\n•Higher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position; \n•Reduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses;\n•Reduced growth prospects from renewable energy projects related to lower cost alternative energy sources and a limited number of purchasers of electricity; and\n•Shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.\nWe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities.\nWe own and operate several coal-fired electric generating units. Although we generally carry sufficient coal inventory at our generating facilities to protect against an interruption or decline in supply, there can be no assurance that the inventory levels will be adequate. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us or that we will be able to take delivery of all the coal volume contracted for. Coal deliveries may occasionally be restricted because of rail congestion and maintenance, derailments, weather, public health crises, and supplier financial hardship as a result of decreased demand for coal. \nIf we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal-fired units, which could lead to increased fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs could result in either reduced margins on net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, a reduction in the volume of net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, and/or an increase in net power purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. There is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates or that recovery would not otherwise be delayed, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses.\nWe use derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity price exposure. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, although the hedging programs of our utilities must be approved by the various state commissions, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. Changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nRestructuring in the regulated energy industry and competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a negative impact on our business and revenues.\nThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Deregulation or other changes in law in the states where we serve our customers could allow third-party suppliers to contract directly with customers for their natural gas and electric supply requirements. In addition, legislation or regulation that supports distributed energy technologies or that allows third party sales from such technologies could result in further competition. This increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a material adverse financial impact on us. \nCertain jurisdictions in which we operate, including Michigan and Illinois, have adopted retail choice. Under Michigan law, our retail electric customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of our Michigan retail load. The iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is excluded from this cap. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer. Although Illinois has adopted retail choice, there is currently little or no impact on the net income of our Illinois utilities as they still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. It is uncertain whether retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin or Minnesota.\nThe FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market within these RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO implemented bid-based energy markets that are part of the MISO Energy Markets. All market participants, including us, must submit day-ahead and/or real time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes an LMP that reflects the market price for energy. We are required to follow MISO's instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISO's responsibility for maintaining the stability of the transmission system. MISO also implemented an ancillary services \n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.     \nmarket for operating reserves that schedules energy and ancillary services at the same time as part of the energy market, allowing for more efficient use of generation assets in the MISO Energy Markets. These market designs continue to have the potential to increase the costs of transmission, the costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, the costs of participation in the MISO Energy Markets, and the costs associated with estimated payment settlements.\nThe FERC rules related to transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale electricity markets among regulated utilities, non-utility generators, wholesale power marketers, and brokers by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale customers, including initiatives designed to encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply. In addition, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations impact hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges, as well as over-the-counter. Technology changes in the power and fuel industries also have significant impacts on wholesale transactions and related costs. We currently cannot predict the impact of these and other developments or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are driven by factors beyond our control.\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, changes in assumptions, market conditions, and other factors may impact the performance of our benefit plan holdings and other investment funds.\nWe have significant obligations related to pension and OPEB plans. If we are unable to successfully manage our benefit plan assets and medical costs, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our cost of providing these plans is dependent upon a number of factors, including actual plan experience, changes made to the plans, and assumptions concerning the future. Types of assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and our required or voluntary contributions to the plans. Plan assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield returns that fall below projected return rates. In addition, medical costs for both active and retired employees may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Our funding requirements could be impacted by a decline in the market value of plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in demographics (including the number of retirements), or changes in life expectancy assumptions. \nIn addition, we maintain rabbi trusts to fund our deferred compensation plans and other investments funds, including our clean energy funds, which from time to time, hold equity and debt investments that are subject to market fluctuations. Decreases in investment performance of these assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, which could become impaired.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would more than likely indicate that the carrying amount of our reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. At December 31, 2024, our goodwill was $3,052.8 million. Other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate that an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. If goodwill or other long-lived assets are deemed to be impaired, we may be required to incur a non-cash charge to earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \nWe may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers and our contractors that are required to acquire and maintain insurance for our benefit. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us. In addition, our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\n\n2024 Form 10-K       WEC Energy Group, Inc.",
