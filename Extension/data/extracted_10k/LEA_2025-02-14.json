Although 2023 industry production returned to pre-pandemic levels, 2024 industry production remained approximately 6% below 2017 peak levels (based on January 2025 S&P Global Mobility projections), and 2024 industry production in North America and Europe, our two largest markets, remained approximately 9% and 24%, respectively, below prior peak levels (based on January 2025 S&P Global Mobility projections). Since 2020, the global economy, as well as the automotive industry, have been influenced directly and indirectly by macroeconomic events resulting in unfavorable conditions, including shortages of semiconductor chips and other components, elevated inflation levels on commodities and labor, higher interest rates, and labor and energy shortages in certain markets. Certain of these factors, among others, continue to impact consumer demand. Our strategy to mitigate these impacts encompasses our comprehensive cost management process, including cost technology optimization, actions to further align our manufacturing capacity to the current industry production environment and investments in automation and other advanced manufacturing technologies, as well as commercial recovery mechanisms. This will allow us to enhance operational efficiencies, improve the utilization of existing facilities and equipment to reduce future expenditures, and streamline administrative functions. For a description of risks related to macroeconomic events, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nDetails on light vehicle production volumes in certain key regions for 2024 and 2023 are provided below. Our actual results are impacted by the specific volume mix of products within each market, as well as other factors described in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\n\n(In thousands of units)               2024 (1)         2023(1) (2)       % Change\nNorth America                    15,467.2           15,682.8                 (1%)\nEurope and Africa                17,543.2           18,390.8                 (5%)\nAsia                             50,545.6           50,415.3                   —%\nSouth America                     2,891.5            2,817.9                   3%\nOther                             1,686.4            1,766.9                 (5%)\nTotal                            88,133.9           89,073.7                 (1%)\n(1) Production data based on S&P Global Mobility.\n(2) Production data for 2023 has been updated from our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect actual production levels.\nAutomotive sales and production can also be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, labor shortages, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives and incentives, trade agreements, tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on Mexico, Canada and China, as well as other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries), the availability and cost of credit, the availability and cost of raw materials and critical components, and logistics issues, as well as vehicle affordability and consumer preferences regarding vehicle powertrains (including preferences regarding hybrid and electric vehicles), size, configuration and features, among other factors. The impact of potential tariffs on our business and financial condition, if any, is subject to a number of factors that are not yet known, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, the scope and nature of any tariffs, the amount of any tariffs, any countermeasures that the target countries may take in response to such tariffs. In light of these uncertainties, we can provide no assurance that any mitigating actions that may become available to us, such as our ability to pass along some or all of the costs of any tariffs to some or all of our customers, will be successful. Our sales and production may be further affected by new entrants to the industry, including domestic automakers in certain regions and non-traditional automakers, and the restructuring actions, including facility closures, of our customers and suppliers. Our operating results are also significantly impacted by the overall commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply particular products, as well as the profitability of the products that we supply for these platforms, which is determined, in part, by the level of vertical integration. The loss of business with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier, or a decrease in the production levels of any such models, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating results.\nDetails on our sales in certain key regions for 2024 and 2023 are provided below:\n\n(In millions)                               2024                         2023       % Change\nNorth America                       $9,749.1                      $9,503.4                3%\nEurope and Africa                    8,298.4                       8,612.6              (4%)\nAsia                                 4,392.4                       4,445.0              (1%)\nSouth America                          866.1                         905.9              (4%)\nTotal                              $23,306.0                     $23,466.9              (1%)\nChina (consolidated)                $2,969.5                      $3,044.9              (2%)\nChina (non-consolidated)             2,104.0                       1,867.4               13%\nThe automotive industry, and our business, continue to be shaped by the broad trend of electrification. Although the adoption of electrified vehicles has been slower than anticipated in certain regions, demand for, and regulatory developments related to, improved energy efficiency and sustainability (e.g., government mandates related to fuel economy and carbon emissions) remain significant drivers of this trend. \nIn 2025, the battery electric vehicle market is expected to represent 17% of global light vehicle production (based on January 2025 S&P Global Mobility projections), as compared to 13% in 2024 and 12% in 2023. Battery electric vehicle production increased to 11.5 million units in 2024 from 10.5 million units in 2023, primarily driven by growth in China. Increasing demand for electrified vehicles is driven by numerous product offerings from both traditional and non-traditional automotive manufacturers, government requirements and incentives, automotive manufacturers' internal targets and a growing segment of end consumers who are seeking alternatives to vehicles with traditional ICE architectures. Meeting this demand requires further \nuse of electronically controlled and assisted powertrains and related components to improve fuel efficiency; the adoption of alternative energy powertrains, such as 48-volt mild hybrid, full hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure battery electric powertrains that facilitate electrification of the vehicle; and the use of lighter weight materials throughout the vehicle.\nOur business is also influenced by vehicle segment trends that continue to experience a shift in consumer preference toward crossover and sport utility vehicles. This trend positively impacts our business as content per vehicle on such vehicles, especially within our Seating business, can be significantly higher. Crossover and sport utility vehicle production has grown to approximately 48% of total vehicle production in 2024, up from 37% five years ago.\nStrategy\nThrough our products, processes, technology and strategic initiatives, we are well-positioned to capitalize on business growth opportunities.

Our sales content tends to be higher on those vehicle platforms and segments which offer more features and functionality. The popularity of particular vehicle platforms and segments varies over time and by regional market. We expect to continue to win new business and grow sales at a greater rate than overall automotive industry production. For further information related to our customers and domestic and foreign sales and operations, see Note 14, \"Segment Reporting,\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.\nOur customers award business to their suppliers in a number of ways, including the award of complete systems, which allows suppliers either to manufacture components internally or to purchase components from other suppliers at their discretion. Certain of our customers also elect to award certain components directly to component suppliers and independent of the award of the complete system. We have selectively expanded certain of our product offerings and component capabilities and continue to invest in manufacturing capacity in low-cost regions to enhance our cost structure and increase our vertical integration opportunities and participation in our customers' direct component sourcing.\nOur customers typically award contracts several years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models and, periodically, even complete brands. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose the business on a new or updated model to a competitor.\nOur core sales backlog reflects our estimated net sales over the next two years from formally awarded new programs, less lost and discontinued programs. This measure excludes the sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures and the impact of the wind down of non-core products in our E-Systems business. As of February 2025, our 2025 to 2026 sales backlog is $1.3 billion. Our current sales backlog reflects $0.2 billion related to 2025, of which 11% and 89% are related to our Seating and E-Systems segments, respectively. In addition, our 2025 to 2026 sales backlog at our non-consolidated joint ventures is approximately $0.5 billion. Our current sales backlog assumes volumes based on the independent industry projections of S&P Global Mobility as of January 2025 and internal estimates, a Euro exchange rate of $1.04/Euro and a Chinese renminbi exchange rate of 7.30/$. This sales backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including vehicle production volumes on new and replacement programs and foreign exchange rates, as well as the timing of production launches and changes in customer development plans. For additional information regarding risks that may affect our sales backlog, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Part II — Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nWe receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer's annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer's requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products. Although most purchase orders may be terminated by our customers at any time, such terminations have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operating results. We are subject to risks that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated or that an automotive manufacturer will not award us a replacement program following the life of a vehicle model. To reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model, we produce automotive systems and components for a broad cross-section of both new and established models. However, larger cars and light trucks, as well as vehicle platforms that offer more features and functionality, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically have more content and, therefore, tend to have a more significant impact on our operating performance. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, consisted of 23% passenger cars, 56% crossover and sport utility vehicles and 21% trucks and vans.\nOur agreements with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity price reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased manufacturing productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed price reduction requirements. However, raw material, energy, commodity, product component and labor costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of such costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, do not typically offset all of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining price environment. In addition, we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange as a result of our low-cost footprint and vertical integration strategies. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For additional information regarding our foreign exchange and commodity price risk, see Part II — Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Commodity Prices\" and Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Market Risk Sensitivity — Foreign Exchange.\" \nSeasonality\nOur principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for holidays and/or model year changeovers, as well as in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. \nRaw Materials\nThe principal raw materials used in our seat systems, electrical distribution and connection systems, BDUs and electronic controllers are generally available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements. Components such as seat trim covers, surface materials such as leather and fabric, seat mechanisms, seat foam, thermal comfort systems such as seat heating, ventilation, active cooling, pneumatic lumbar and massage products, headrests, connection systems and certain other components are either manufactured by us internally or purchased from multiple suppliers under various types of supply agreements (certain of which are sourced by our customers and certain of which are sourced by us). The majority of the steel used in our products is comprised of fabricated components that are integrated into a seat system, such as seat frames, recliner mechanisms, seat tracks and other mechanical components. Therefore, our exposure to changes in steel prices is primarily indirect, through these purchased components. With the exception of certain connection systems, the materials that we use to manufacture wire harness assemblies are substantially purchased from suppliers, including extruded and insulated wire and cable. The majority of our copper purchases are comprised of extruded wire and cable that we integrate into electrical wire harnesses. In general, our copper purchases, as well as a significant portion of our leather purchases, are subject to price index agreements with our customers and suppliers. We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term supply contracts to purchase key components. We generally retain the right to terminate these agreements if our supplier does not remain competitive in terms of cost, quality, delivery, technology or customer support.\nIntellectual Property\nWorldwide, we have approximately 2,800 patents and patent applications pending. While we believe that our patent portfolio is a valuable asset, no individual patent or group of patents is critical to the success of our business. We also license selected technologies to automotive manufacturers and to other automotive suppliers. We continually strive to identify and implement new technologies for use in the design and development of our products.\nAdvanced technology development is conducted worldwide at our seven advanced technology centers and at our product engineering centers. At these centers, we engineer our products to comply with applicable safety standards, meet quality and durability standards, respond to environmental conditions and conform to customer and consumer requirements. Our global innovation and technology center located in Southfield, Michigan, develops and integrates new concepts and is our central location for consumer research, benchmarking, craftsmanship and industrial design activity.\nWe have numerous registered trademarks in the United States and in many foreign countries. The most important of these marks include LEAR CORPORATION® (including our stylized version thereof) and LEAR®, which are widely used in connection with our products and services. Our other principal brands include GUILFORD® and EAGLE OTTAWA®. ComfortFlex by LearTM, ComfortMax Seat by LearTM, ConfigurE+TM seating, FlexAirTM non-foam alternative, INTUTM seating, ProTec® active head restraints, ReNewKnitTM fabrics, SMART JUNCTION BOXTM technology, SoyFoamTM foam substitute and TeXstyleTM fabrics are some of our other trademarks used in connection with certain of our product lines.\nGovernment Regulations and Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to health, safety and, increasingly, sustainability matters. Costs incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are not material to our capital expenditures, financial performance or competitive position. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" under the heading \"Legal and Regulatory Risks.\"\nWe are committed to sustainability in our operations and products. We adhere to local, state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects. These laws, regulations and ordinances may impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes. For a description of our outstanding environmental matters and other legal proceedings, see Note 13, \"Legal and Other Contingencies,\" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.\nIn addition, our customers are subject to significant environmentally focused state, federal and foreign laws and regulations that regulate vehicle emissions, fuel economy and other matters related to the environmental impact of vehicles. To the extent that such laws and regulations ultimately increase or decrease automotive vehicle production, such laws and regulations would likely impact our business. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nFurthermore, we currently offer products that advance sustainability, such as ReNewKnitTM and FlexAirTM, and are creating technologies that facilitate environmentally friendly transportation alternatives, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. Our expertise, capabilities and environmental leadership are allowing us to expand our product offerings in this area. \nJoint Ventures and Noncontrolling Interests\nWe form joint ventures in order to gain entry into new markets, expand our product offerings and broaden our customer base. In particular, we believe that certain joint ventures have provided us, and will continue to provide us, with the opportunity to expand our business relationships with Asian automotive manufacturers, particularly in emerging markets. We also partner with companies having significant local experience in commerce and customs, as well as capacity, to reduce our financial risk and enhance our potential for achieving expected financial returns. In some cases, these joint ventures may be located in North America and used to expand our customer relationships.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had sixteen operating joint ventures located in five countries. Of these joint ventures, six are consolidated, and ten are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Fourteen of the joint ventures operate in Asia, and two operate in North America (both of which are dedicated to serving Asian automotive manufacturers). Net sales of our consolidated joint ventures accounted for approximately 8% of our net sales in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our investments in non-consolidated joint ventures totaled $221 million.\nA summary of our non-consolidated operating joint ventures, including ownership percentages, is shown below.

      "text": "ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors affecting our business identified elsewhere in this Report, the material risk factors affecting our operations include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n•Our industry is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by our automotive manufacturer customers and our content per vehicle. The automotive industry is cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, consumer demand and spending levels, and geopolitical issues. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, labor shortages, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives and incentives, trade agreements, tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers, the availability and cost of credit, the availability and cost of raw materials and critical components, and logistics issues, as well as vehicle affordability and consumer preferences regarding vehicle powertrains (including preferences regarding hybrid and electric vehicles), size, configuration and features, among other factors. Our sales and production may be further affected by new entrants to the industry, including domestic automakers in certain regions and non-traditional automakers, and the restructuring actions, including facility closures, of our customers and suppliers.\nAn economic downturn or other adverse industry conditions that result in a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could reduce our sales or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Further, our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business, and thereby maintain our financial performance in the future, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis to reflect the market overall. We may not be successful in such diversification.\n•Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities, product components and labor could adversely affect our financial performance.\nRaw material, energy, commodity, product component and labor costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of increases in such costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, do not typically offset all of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining price environment. In addition, the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities, product components and labor fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of our control, including regulatory requirements and restrictions, natural disasters and other supply chain disruptions, which may impact our ability to meet the production demands of our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, commodities, product \ncomponents and labor, or restrictions on the availability thereof, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•The lack of commercial success of or an increase in directed component sourcing for a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe receive purchase orders from our customers that generally provide for the supply of a customer's requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant for the life of a particular vehicle program, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. It is possible that a particular vehicle model is not successful with consumers or that our customers elect to manufacture our products internally, purchase our products from other suppliers or increase the extent to which they require us to utilize specific suppliers or materials in the manufacture of our products. The loss of business due to these factors occurring could reduce our sales or margins and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•Our inability to achieve product cost reductions to offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance.\nDownward pricing pressure by automotive manufacturers is a characteristic of the automotive industry. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our financial performance is largely dependent on our ability to achieve product cost reductions through product design enhancements, supply chain management, manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to and anticipate the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•International trade policies, including protectionist trade policies, such as tariffs and sanctions, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nDue to the interconnectedness of the global economy, policy changes in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world. Changes in international trade policies, including: (i) changes to existing trade agreements; (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in customs duties and tariffs on goods imported into the United States and reciprocal actions by other countries, can adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \nOn February 1, 2025, President Trump announced the imposition of new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, to take effect on February 4, 2025. On February 3, 2025, President Trump announced that the tariffs imposed on imports from Mexico and Canada would be paused for thirty days. The impact of these potential tariffs on our business and financial condition, if any, is subject to a number of factors that are not yet known, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, the scope and nature of any tariffs, the amount of any tariffs, any countermeasures that the target countries may take in response to such tariffs. In light of these uncertainties, we can provide no assurance that any mitigating actions that may become available to us, such as our ability to pass along some or all of the costs of any tariffs to some or all of our customers, will be successful.\nIn addition to potential increases in customs duties and tariffs in the United States and other countries, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\") is subject to renewal in 2026. There can be no assurance that any newly negotiated terms in the USMCA will not adversely affect our business. Also, China presents unique risks to U.S. automotive manufacturers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain. It remains unclear what specific actions the current U.S. administration may take to resolve trade-related issues with China and other countries. \nFurther, the U.S. and other governments could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates. Any of the above factors could impact our supply chain, as well as our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n•Adverse developments affecting or the financial distress of one or more of our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. We are responsible for managing our supply chain, including suppliers that may be the sole sources of products that we require, that our customers direct us to use or that have unique capabilities that would make it difficult and/or expensive to re-source. In certain instances, entire industries may experience short-term capacity constraints. Additionally, our production capacity and costs, and that of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected by force majeure events, such as natural disasters, as well as tariffs, sanctions or other significant events. Any such significant event could adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions in one or more of the regions in which we operate could result in financial distress within our supply base, which could cause a supply disruption and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n•A significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA substantial number of our employees and the employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. We have labor agreements covering approximately 81,500 employees globally. In the United States and Canada, each of our unionized facilities has a separate collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facility, with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of the other agreements. Labor agreements covering approximately 84% of our global unionized work force, including labor agreements in the United States and Canada covering approximately 5% of our global unionized workforce, are scheduled to expire in 2025. There can be no assurances that these upcoming negotiations or any other future negotiations with the unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A labor dispute involving us, any of our customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to our customers or that otherwise affects our operations, or the inability by us, any of our customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to our customers to negotiate, upon the expiration of a labor agreement, an extension of such agreement or a new agreement on satisfactory terms could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, if any of our significant customers experience a material work stoppage, the customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. This could require us to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to such products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n•Our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees could affect our ability to execute our strategy.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background and experience, as well as our ability to develop, engage and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business. In addition, while we strive to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy and meet our business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.\n•Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with volatile economic and political environments.\nWe have substantial international operations, with manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries, including Mexico and countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Europe. Some of the markets in which we do business may have volatile economic and/or political environments. This may expose us to heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical or other events, including:\n–exposure to local economic conditions;\n–political, economic and civil instability and uncertainty (including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, drug cartel-related and other forms of violence, and outbreaks of war);\n–labor scarcity and unrest;\n–expropriation, governmental takeover and nationalization;\n–currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls and the ability to economically hedge currencies;\n–withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n–investment restrictions or requirements;\n–repatriation restrictions or requirements;\n–trade wars, tariffs or sanctions;\n–concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and the environmental impact in foreign countries where our products are produced and raw materials and/or components are sourced, as well as changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries;\n–pandemic illness and limited access to vaccines;\n–increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains; and\n–global sovereign fiscal matters and creditworthiness, including potential defaults and the related impacts on economic activity, including the possible effects on credit markets, currency values, monetary unions, international treaties and fiscal policies.\nExpanding our sales and operations in lower-cost regions are important elements of our strategy. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above is substantial. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. However, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•Certain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations, particularly in Asia, are conducted through joint ventures. With respect to our joint ventures, we may share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more partners that may not share our goals and objectives. Operating a joint venture requires us to operate the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement that we entered into with our partners, which may require additional organizational formalities, as well as the sharing of information and decision making. Additional risks associated with joint ventures include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, the ability to enforce such obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners, a change in the ownership of any of our partners and less of an ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related rules and regulations. Additionally, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•Our failure to execute our strategic objectives could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to successfully execute our strategic objectives. Our strategy is based on four pillars designed to drive growth and profitability: (1) extend our market leadership position in Seating with priceable features, including modularity and thermal comfort systems; (2) transform our E-Systems business through accelerated growth in connection systems and vehicle architecture evolution and electrification; (3) build on our reputation for operational excellence through organic and inorganic investments in automation and digital technologies; and (4) prioritize people and the planet through our sustainability initiatives to drive business growth, cost reductions and improved employee retention. Various factors, including the industry environment and the other matters described herein and in Part II — Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" including \"— Forward-Looking Statements,\" could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic objectives. These risk factors include our failure to identify suitable opportunities for organic investment and/or acquisitions, our inability to successfully develop such opportunities or complete such acquisitions or our inability to successfully utilize or integrate the investments in our operations. Our failure to execute our strategic objectives could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurances that, even if implemented, our strategic objectives will be successful.\n•Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers' timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to \nthese new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers' introduction of new vehicles. Customer decisions on program launch timing may be impacted by industry conditions, government regulations and consumer preferences, and therefore, the timing of such launches may also be subject to change. Our inability to effectively anticipate and manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new entrants to the industry, to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We and most of our competitors are seeking to expand market share with new and existing customers, including in high growth regions. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, service and technology. Our competitors' efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. In addition, the automotive industry has attracted, and will continue to attract, new entrants, including domestic automakers in certain regions and non-traditional automakers as a result of the evolving nature of the automotive vehicle market, including the increasing adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. Further, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, including a focus on electrification and digitization. If we are unable to differentiate our products, maintain a low-cost footprint or compete effectively to win business with new domestic automakers and other new entrants, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•If we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the global transportation industry toward electrification could adversely affect our business.\nThe global transportation industry is increasingly focused on the development of more fuel-efficient solutions to meet demands from consumers and governments worldwide to address climate change and an increased desire for environmentally sustainable solutions. The impacts of these changes on us are uncertain and could ultimately prove dramatic. If we do not respond appropriately, the evolution toward electrification and other energy sources, including the timing of such evolution, could adversely affect our business. The increased adoption of hybrid and fully electrified powertrains may result in lower demand for some of our products. The evolution of the industry toward electrification has also attracted increased competition from new entrants to the light vehicle industry. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to evolving consumer preferences and customer landscape could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•A disruption in our information technology systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, sub-suppliers or other contract parties, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, and other cybersecurity risks, such as a security incident resulting in unauthorized access to or theft of personal or other sensitive information, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity, availability and security of our information technology networks. Despite the security and business continuity measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, human resources, product development and manufacturing processes), as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers, and certain of our connected vehicle systems and components that may collect and store sensitive end-user data (which could include personal information) could be breached, disabled or damaged by, without limitation, internal or external threat actors, computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, supply chain attacks, human error, ransomware attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, natural or man-made incidents or disasters, or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including our industry, and are expected to continue, if not increase, in the future. In particular, ransomware or other attacks that are intended to disrupt our business operations are becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly for manufacturing companies, and can lead to significant interruptions in operations and the ability to provide products or services, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a disruptive event, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.\nWe are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of companies globally. As a result, if our products or services are compromised, unavailable or unable to be manufactured or delivered, a significant number or, in some instances, all of our customers' operations and their data could be simultaneously affected. Our contracts with customers and others may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages or claims related to our security obligations. The potential \nliability and associated consequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event impacting multiple customers could be catastrophic and result in irreparable harm.\nThe secure operation of our information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of information by these networks, is critical to our operations and strategy. A security incident could result in business disruption, including interruptions of manufacturing and distribution of vehicle systems and components that we supply to our customers or our plant operations, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information, or unauthorized access to or theft of personal information, such as that of our employees or end consumers of vehicles that contain certain of our connected vehicle systems or components. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our operational systems and products from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our actions and investments may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, vendors or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks, or to divert funds or wire transfers. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or deployed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion or security incident. We maintain cyber liability insurance to provide additional support during significant events, as well as a level of financial protection in the event of certain cybersecurity-related losses, but there is no guarantee that our coverage will be sufficient or applicable in all cases. \nMoreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or adversely impact systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks, and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these attacks may have on us. It may also be difficult and/or costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain and remediate a security incident. Our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses and disruptions of our business. In addition, the information technology systems and software that we and our vendors use are vulnerable to outages, breakdowns, software vulnerabilities, coding errors and other damage from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. For example, our business operations suffered temporary interruptions and impacts from the global CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. event in July 2024. To the extent that our business is interrupted, including the vehicle systems and components that we supply to our customers or our plant operations, or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately accessed, used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, operating capacity, ability to provide our goods and services, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and/or subject us to regulatory actions, including those contemplated by data privacy laws and regulations such as European Union General Data Privacy Regulation, China Cyber Security Laws including the China Personal Information Protection Law, India's Information Technology Act and supplementary rules, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or litigation. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our customers, suppliers and other third party service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Any security incident of any of these third parties' systems could result in unauthorized access to our or our customers' or suppliers' sensitive data or our own information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation or cause a loss of confidence in our products or services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If the third parties with whom we work experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if the third parties with whom we work fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.\n•Pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises have disrupted our business and operations, and future public health crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the United States or globally have disrupted, and may disrupt in the future, our business, which could materially affect our financial condition including liquidity, operating results and future expectations. Any such events may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations. In particular, we could experience among other things: (1) continued or additional global supply disruptions, including component and material shortages; (2) labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) a decline in consumer demand; and (5) an impaired ability to access credit and capital markets. Any future \npublic health crises, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows going forward.\n•Perspectives on global climate change and other sustainability matters by various stakeholders could adversely affect our business.\nCustomer, investor, employee and other stakeholder expectations of us and our supply base in matters involving sustainability continue to evolve. The enhanced stakeholder focus on sustainability requires continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and their associated requirements, and may result in potentially differing perspectives on these topics among stakeholders. Our failure, or that of our supply base, to adequately meet stakeholder expectations or address stakeholder concerns, including concerns about environmental impacts and similar matters, may result in, among other things, negative sentiment toward us or our products, the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent.\n•Global climate change could adversely affect our business.\nThe effects of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, could impact our business. Such effects could disrupt our operations by, among other things, impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks, as well as our decisions regarding business strategy, capital allocation and innovation. We could also experience indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.\n•Impairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n•Significant changes in discount rates, the actual return on pension assets and other factors related to our global defined benefit plans could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded related to our global defined benefit plans. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that income or expense related to the defined benefit plans be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial calculations, which reflect certain assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions relate to interest rates, the capital markets and other economic conditions. These assumptions, as well as the actual value of pension assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension and other postretirement benefit expense for the year. Although pension expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect pension expense also affect the amount of cash that we will contribute to our pension plans. Because interest rates and the values of these pension assets have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, pension and other postretirement benefit expense in subsequent periods, the funded status of our pension plans and the future minimum required pension contributions, if any, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the enactment of new tax legislation, changes in the level and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax holiday status. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits globally. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be \nhighly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain of our tax reporting positions and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of current and future tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") issued new guidelines, known as \"Pillar Two,\" to implement a 15% global corporate minimum tax to address gaps in current tax laws and ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax in the countries in which they operate. Countries may implement the OECD Pillar Two model rules as issued, in a modified form or not at all. A number of countries have passed legislation enacting certain parts of the OECD's Pillar Two framework effective in 2024. As a result of the uncertainty, OECD Pillar Two could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and result in higher cash tax liabilities depending on which countries enact minimum tax legislation and in what manner. \nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n•Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as $2.0 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The debt instruments governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. We also lease certain buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements with terms exceeding one year, which are accounted for as operating leases. Additionally, any downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to us and our debt may ultimately impact our access to capital markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt and lease obligations, to refinance our debt obligations or to access capital markets on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n•A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn the event that our products fail to perform as expected, regardless of fault, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims. Our customers may also pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability, warranty and recall claims related to our products. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, but such coverage may be limited. We do not maintain insurance for warranty or recall matters. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including sub-suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters, employment matters and antitrust matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•The continuing focus on human rights and environmental laws and regulations, as well as related customer requirements, globally could cause us to incur significant costs. \nConcerns over human rights, environmental pollution and climate change have produced significant legislative and regulatory efforts globally. In addition, our customers have imposed various requirements on their suppliers, including us, in response to these concerns. We expect that these regulatory and customer requirements will continue to increase in number and breadth of scope for the foreseeable future, thereby affecting our business. Complying with these requirements will likely require us to incur costs, make investments in new innovations, change product and production processes and/or modify product supply chains, certain of which actions could be significant. Significant challenges may exist to comply with new legislative efforts around supply chain transparency due to the inherent complexity of global automotive supply \nchains. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to lost business opportunities and/or future liabilities, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe and the automotive industry are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to health, safety and, increasingly, sustainability matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, capital markets, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy, international trade, including tariffs and sanctions, human rights, immigration and other labor issues (including labor costs), all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, including those in connection with the new U.S. administration, or the interpretation thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n•We may incur fines or penalties, damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees, suppliers, sub-suppliers or other contract parties, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, trade sanctions, data privacy, environmental, human rights or other laws.\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, human rights, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, trade sanctions, data privacy, anti-trust and money laundering, due to our domestic and global operations. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, suppliers, sub-suppliers or other contract parties, agents and business partners. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may conflict with laws of other jurisdictions and often are difficult to interpret and apply, could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n•We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us and our customers in the future. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n•Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and we are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Failure to successfully protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business. Furthermore, we may not be able to readily identify unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Also, while we believe we have the necessary rights to use all of the intellectual property we use, if we are found to infringe on the rights of others, we could be adversely impacted. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.",
