The year end is December 31, 2024 unless additional years are included or noted.\nOverview\nFastenal Company (together with our subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as Fastenal or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We opened our first branch in 1967 in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population today of approximately 26,000. We began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small, medium, and, in subsequent years, large cities. Over time, how and where we engage our customers has expanded and evolved. Today we sell a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines through a global network of in-market locations utilizing diverse technologies such as vending devices, bin stock devices, and eBusiness. The large majority of our transactions are business-to-business. We provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document. At the end of 2024, we had 3,628 in-market locations (defined in the table below) in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in North America, with 12 in the United States (U.S.), two in Canada, and one in Mexico; one in Asia; and two in Europe, and we employed 23,702 people. We believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers, and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement.\nOur Channels to Market\nWe engage our customers primarily through branch and Onsite locations. Branches and Onsites exist very close to our customers, usually within miles of, and often within or immediately proximate to, our customers' physical operations. Together, these constitute our 'in-market' network. Many of our customers engage with us through eBusiness, but in most cases these customers are utilizing eBusiness to supplement our service through our other channels.\nThe following table shows, as of the end of each of the last 10 fiscal years, our consolidated net sales; the number of branch, Onsite, and total in-market locations; their respective sales, as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and Onsite locations; and our sales generated from non-traditional sources:\n\n2024                                                                             2023            2022            2021            2020            2019            2018            2017            2016            2015\nNet sales                                                $7,546.0         7,346.7         6,980.6         6,010.9         5,647.3         5,333.7         4,965.1         4,390.5         3,962.0         3,869.2    \nBranch locations                                            1,597           1,597           1,683           1,793           2,003           2,114           2,227           2,383           2,503           2,622    \nBranch sales (1)                                         $4,109.3         4,073.6         4,161.6         3,726.2         3,587.1         3,660.1         3,625.8         3,399.6         3,198.1         3,281.8    \nAverage monthly sales per branch location (2)              $214.4           207.0           199.5           163.6           145.2           140.5           131.1           116.0           104.0           104.0    \nOnsite locations                                            2,031           1,822           1,623           1,416           1,265           1,114             894             605             401             264    \nOnsite sales (1)                                         $3,201.6         2,926.7         2,465.5         1,898.0         1,485.6         1,391.7         1,081.7           770.2           569.2           454.3    \nAverage monthly sales per Onsite location (2)              $138.5           141.6           135.2           118.0           104.1           115.5           120.3           127.6           142.7           158.4    \nOther sales (3)                                            $235.1           346.4           353.5           386.7           574.6           281.9           257.6           220.7           194.7           133.1    \nTotal in-market locations (4)                               3,628           3,419           3,306           3,209           3,268           3,228           3,121           2,988           2,904           2,886    \n\n      (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Sales attributable to our traditional and international branch locations (both of which are defined below), and our Onsite locations, respectively.\n      (2)                                                                                                                                                    Average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and Onsites, respectively, in the given year, factoring in the beginning and ending location count, divided by total sales attributable to our branch and Onsite locations, respectively, further divided by 12 months. This information is presented in thousands.\n      (3)        This portion of sales is generated outside our traditional in-market locations, examples of which include sales arising from our custom in-house manufacturing, industrial services, and other non-traditional sources of sales. In 2020, this included the effects of COVID-19, one response to which was substantial sales of pandemic-related products that were direct-shipped (versus sold through in-market locations) as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly.\n      (4)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                'In-market locations' is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of Onsite locations.\nThis structure has evolved over time as a result of one of Fastenal's guiding principles since inception: that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer. This has been achieved by opening branch locations and, more recently, Onsite locations. Today, we believe there are few companies that offer our North American in-market location coverage. In 2024, roughly 53% of our sales and 50% of our in-market locations were in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (populations in the U.S. and Canada greater than 500,000 people), while 21% of our sales and 20% of our in-market locations were in small MSAs (populations under 500,000 people), and 26% of our sales and 30% of our in-market locations were not in an MSA (populations under 50,000 people). In our view, this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis. Maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers' operations have represented, and continue to represent, the foundation of our service approach.\nThe distinctions between our branch and Onsite locations are as follows:\nBranch locations typically service a wide variety and number of customers, ranging from the local operations of large, national account customers to smaller local businesses. Locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network and employment and production data for manufacturing and non-residential construction companies. We stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and tailored by our district and branch personnel to the needs of the local customer base. \nBased on the unique characteristics of certain markets and the judgement of local leadership, different branch types have emerged over time. In the United States and Canada, the most common type is the Customer Fulfillment Center (CFC), which tends to feature a limited showroom and stock customer-specific inventory. These have the appearance of and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location. The United States and Canada also utilize a Customer Service Branch (CSB), which tend to feature a showroom and a more standardized stocking model of products designed for contractors. CSBs often conduct some business with non-account or retail-like customers. At the end of 2024, 87% of our United States and Canada branches operated as a CFC and 13% operated as a CSB. Outside the United States and Canada we typically deploy an International Branch. These locations lack a showroom and tend to service fewer customers who tend to be large, national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing and heavily oriented toward planned product spend.\nRegardless of what branch type ultimately evolves to service the unique features of a specific geographic location, all our branches share a common purpose and similar operating priorities. We believe our ability to provide a consistent local service model on a global basis is attractive to our customer base, which consists heavily of North American-based multinational companies with significant foreign operations. \nSince Fastenal's founding and through 2013, branch openings were a primary growth driver for us, peaking in 2013 at 2,687 locations. Branches were entirely U.S.-based until 1994, when we opened our first location in Canada followed by opening our first branch location in Mexico in 2001. Since then, we have continued to expand our global footprint, including into Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. In the period from 2013 to 2023, we experienced a net decline of 1,090 in our total branch count, which was primarily due to consolidations in our U.S. market. New growth drivers, business models, and business tools emerged and diminished the direct role of branch openings in our growth, resulting in a strategic rationalization to align our physical footprint with changes in our business strategies. In 2024, we disclosed that this strategic rationalization had concluded and future openings and closings were likely to be more balanced and in accordance with the strategies and specific circumstances of local operations. \nAt the end of 2024, we had 1,499 branches in North America, which includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico, representing 52.2% of net sales and 98 branches outside of North America representing 2.2% of net sales. \nOnsite locations are not new, having entered into the first such arrangement in 1992. However, it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014, at which point we made substantial investments to accelerate its traction in the marketplace. In this model, we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within, or strategically proximate to, the customer's facility, with inventory that is specific to the customer's needs. In many cases, we are shifting sales with the customer from an existing branch location, though we also see new customer opportunities arise as a result of our Onsite capabilities. The model is best suited for larger companies, though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of sales than most of our competitors. It has been our experience that the sales mix at our Onsite locations typically produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations, but we gain sales with the customer and our cost to serve is lower. We have identified over 11,000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in North America with potential to implement the Onsite service model. These include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today, and potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today. However, as awareness of our capabilities has grown, we have identified additional Onsite potential with certain agencies of state, provincial, and local government customers, and academia. We also believe as we continue to follow our existing national account customers outside the U.S., our market potential for Onsite solutions will continue to expand. The international opportunity is substantial, but our speed is limited by our relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the U.S. We expect sales from Onsite arrangements to continue to increase meaningfully over time. At the end of 2024, we had 1,961 Onsite locations in North America, which included the United States, Canada, and Mexico, representing 41.6% of net sales and 70 Onsite locations outside of North America representing 0.8% of net sales. As of December 31, 2024, we signed 358, 326, and 356 new Onsite locations (referred to herein as signings) in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nAt the end of 2024, we operated branches and Onsites in 25 total countries.

In any in-market location, certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable, such as employee-related expenses, while others, like rent and utility costs, tend to be fixed. As a result, it has been shown that as an in-market location increases its sales base over time, it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin. This ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by: (1) general growth based on end market expansion and/or market share gains that increases the monthly sales of the location and (2) the age of the in-market location (new locations tend to be less profitable due to start-up costs and, in the case of a branch, the time necessary to generate a customer base). The paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an Onsite location, as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage, while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employee-related expenses. In the short term, the Onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established sales away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged.\nThere are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close an in-market location. Key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market, factories may have closed, our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer branches, and/or our customers may have transitioned to our Onsite model. An Onsite location may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise, in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local branch. \nWe utilize additional types of selling locations within our network, but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number, comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations. We remain committed to a large, robust service network, including traditional branches, international branches, and Onsites; it remains the indispensable foundation of our business. We anticipate that relatively stable branch count in the United States and Canada, combined with growth in branch count outside of the United States and Canada and growth in global Onsite locations, will result in an increase to overall in-market locations over time.\nOur Business Tools\nFastenal Managed Inventory (FMI®)\nOver time, we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location, increase the visibility of a customer's supply chain (to the customer as well as our personnel), and/or improve the ability to monitor or control usage. While there are isolated exceptions, these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and Onsite channels to enhance service to our customers. Collectively, these tools comprise our Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) Technology suite. We believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers. FMI programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and, coupled with our fully integrated distribution network, foster a strong relationship with customers.\nIndustrial vending (FASTVend®) was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control. Benefits include reduced consumption, reduced purchase orders, reduced product handling, and 24-hour product availability. We believe that we have a market advantage by virtue of our extensive in-market network of inventory and local personnel. For these reasons, the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011, and we finished 2024 with approximately 119,800 FASTVend devices in the field. We believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized. We also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base of devices before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support. We estimate the market could support as many as 1.7 million vending units and, as a result, we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time. \nOur industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices, with 16 of these being in either a helix or locker format. Our most utilized models include the helix-based FAST 5000 and our 12- and 18-door lockers; combined, these comprise approximately 64% of our installed base of devices. These are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers. Target monthly sales per device typically range from under $1,000 to in excess of $3,000, with our flagship FAST 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of $2,000. \nBin stock (FASTStock℠ and FASTBin®) programs, where product is held in bins in a customer facility, are similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities. Such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time, with open bins being clustered in a racking system, each of which holds original equipment manufacturing (OEM) fasteners, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) fasteners, and/or non-fastener products that are consumed in the customers' operations. Historically, these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or Fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need. These bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customized digital plan-o-grams, which we call FASTStock and allow for the scanning of product when it is at a minimum desired level. However, in 2019 we introduced our FASTBin technology. FASTBin is the evolution of FASTStock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 24/7 continuous inventory monitoring, real-time inventory visibility, and automatic replenishment of bin stock parts.\nThese technologies come in four forms: (1) scales that utilize a high-precision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum; (2) infrared (IR) that uses IR sensors lining individual bins to provide real-time visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values, notifying Fastenal to replenish when inventory hits an established minimum threshold; (3) RFID, which is a Kanban system that utilizes RFID tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone (also part of the same racking system), a notification is sent to Fastenal to refill the order; and (4) FASTClick, which is an electronic button utilized on products or in locations that do not lend themselves to a vending- or bin-based solution that allows a customer to signal they would like a replenishment activity without the need of a Fastenal representative. These technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes, allowing for a lean supply chain, reducing risk of stock-outs, and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier.\nOur weighted FMI measure combines signings and installations of FASTBin and FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We do not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins, shelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. This conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each FMI device signed or installed and compares it to the $2,000 target monthly throughput of our FAST 5000 vending device. For example, an RFID enclosure, with target monthly sales of $2,000 would be counted as '1.00' machine equivalent ($2,000/$2,000 = 1.00). An infrared bin, with target monthly sales of $40, would be counted as '0.02' machine equivalent ($40/$2,000 = 0.02).\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\n\n                                                                                                                        Twelve-month Period\n2024                                                                                                        2023                     Change\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs)                                 27,984                      24,126                      16.0    %\nSignings per day                                                             110                          95                               \nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period)            126,957                     113,138                      12.2    %\nFASTStock sales                                                           $956.6                       927.6                       3.1    %\n% of sales                                                                  12.5   %                    12.5   %                           \nFASTBin/FASTVend sales                                                  $2,295.5                     2,070.2                      10.9    %\n% of sales                                                                  30.0   %                    27.8   %                           \nFMI sales                                                               $3,252.1                     2,997.8                       8.5    %\nFMI daily sales                                                            $12.8                        11.8                       7.6    %\n% of sales                                                                  42.5   %                    40.3   %                           \nDigital Solutions\nWe also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers, leverage local inventory for same-day solutions, and provide efficient service. While there is a transactional element to our digital services, many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain. In many cases, this provides insights that allow us to migrate transactional, 'non-sticky' (and traditionally high cost) online spend into a 'sticky' managed setting (such as our FMI programs). These solutions take many forms:\n1) Transactional. Our eBusiness includes eProcurement activities, which are integrated transactions, including electronic data interchange (EDI), and eCommerce (transactional website sales), which provide a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure MRO and unplanned spend. While there is a retail component to our transactional digital services, most of the sales attributable to this is with our traditional customer base, nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools it utilizes with Fastenal. We attribute the sales generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the in-market location traditionally servicing this customer location.\n2) Analytics. Data analytics provide customers with detailed insights into their business operations. FAST360° offers a comprehensive view of inventory and spending, allowing users to visualize product organization and analyze spending trends. FAST360° Analytics uses Microsoft Power BI to offer stakeholders visualization tools for analyzing spend, supply channels, and cost savings. FAST360° acts as the bridge between our fulfillment operations and a customer's view into our managed service model, and provides our customers with one central source of information. These platforms empower users to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and improve efficiency by providing actionable insights into Fastenal-managed inventory and spending. By incorporating visual representations of complex data into standardized and tailored reporting templates, the team collaborates with Fastenal's customers and business leaders to turn insights into action. \n3) Digital Visibility. Certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves and/or to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chain operations. For instance, we have developed, and continue to develop, 'Mobility' applications, one example of which is our Vending App, which provides a number of benefits. It provides easy, real-time information pertaining to a customer's local inventory position within their point-of-use devices. It incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices, which improves customer inventories while reducing the risk of stock-outs. Moving our fulfillment process from a vending device-based keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process (reduced risk of product outages), reducing time consumed (greater efficiency) while improving accuracy (improved quality assurance). We will continue to build out our suite of Mobility applications. EDI is the connectivity between our system and our customers' procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their Enterprise Resource Planning system or through a third-party procurement network or marketplace. These solutions provide a system-to-system exchange of electronic procurement documents (such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices for direct and indirect spend). Our eProcurement Solutions provide a bridge between our \nmanaged replenishment activity and our customers' procurement systems – creating an efficient, accurate and streamlined procure-to-pay process. \n4.) Crib Management. We host FASTCrib, a cloud-based software tool designed to provide customers with visibility and control of their entire supply chain. It is an integrated platform that maintains customer-specific product catalogs, provides control and tracking of inventory levels, streamlines and consolidates procurement processes, and enables rich visualization and reporting in an environment with robust user controls. It also has modules for asset tracking and integrates into our FMI suite. FASTCrib creates a one-stop, just-in-time supply chain management capability for all of the products and services consumed by our customers, whether provided directly by Fastenal or other vendors. \nDigital Footprint\nOur digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that proportion of our eBusiness sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both us and our customers. As a result, we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities. Our Digital Footprint represented 60.4% of sales in 2024.\nWe believe the combination of our broad product offering, physical presence on a global scale, and toolbox of services, specialists, and digital capabilities, produces a customer engagement model that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate. This is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and difficult to displace service. We also believe it differentiates us when compared to web purchasing models as an independent sales channel. We expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time. Our greatest opportunity lies with the deployment of efficient and effective supply chain programs. We are focused on addressing the four key components: people, products, processes, and technology, to support this model.\nDistribution Network\nWe operate 15 regional distribution centers in North America: 12 in the U.S., two in Canada, and one in Mexico. We also operate one distribution center in Asia and two distribution centers in Europe. These distribution centers give us approximately 5.1 million square feet of distribution capacity. Additional details on these locations can be found within the 'Item 2. Properties' section of this Form 10-K. These distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our in-market locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier, with approximately 79% of our North American in-market locations receiving service four to five times per week. The distribution centers in Indiana and Kansas also serve as 'master' hubs, with those in California and North Carolina serving as 'secondary' hubs to support the needs of the in-market locations in their geographic regions, as well as to provide a broader selection of products for the in-market locations serviced by the other distribution centers.\nWe currently operate 11 of our North American distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). These distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency, and currently handle approximately 94% of our picking activity. We expect to invest in additional automation technologies, expand existing distribution facilities, and/or add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our in-market locations increases.\nWe also utilize a network of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) which reside within our existing distribution centers and are intended to support areas that have a dense population of FMI devices. Traditionally, branch personnel were solely responsible for stocking and packaging FMI-related inventory, delivering to a customer's location, and refilling the customer's devices. As our sales through FMI devices have grown, this approach resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnel's time being spent on non-sales activities, an issue we are mitigating through LIFTs. We primarily utilize a 'drop-and-deliver' model wherein a LIFT is responsible for stocking and packaging FMI supplies, producing inventory and accuracy benefits, and delivering them to the business unit, where delivery and replenishment is then performed by local district or branch personnel. In a minority of cases we deploy a 'drop-and-scatter' model, wherein delivery and replenishment is also performed by LIFT personnel. In 2024, approximately 10% of our FMI sales was supported through a LIFT, but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40% of our FMI sales.\nTransportation\nThe ability to move product, globally and domestically, from our sources of supply to our customers is critical to the competitiveness of our business model. We utilize multiple modes of transportation to support our business model.\nWe transport product from our global manufacturing and supplier partners to our distribution centers. Related costs range from port fees, duties, costs related to container and shipper services, and inland trucking and intermodal charges. We consider these expenses to be a part of our landed product cost, and significant fluctuations are typically addressed through product pricing.\nWe transport product between our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our in-market locations. We typically transport approximately 90% of our products on our own fleet of Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks, with the remainder being on third party shippers. Costs range from lease charges, driver pay, fuel costs to support our captive fleet, and fees paid to third-party shippers. These expenses are included in cost of goods sold but are not considered a part of our landed product cost, with fluctuations typically addressed by applying freight charges to customer purchases and by securing commercial back-hauls. We primarily lease our trucks, and at December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 490 units.\nWe transport product from our in-market locations to our customers on a fleet of pick-up, box, and other trucks. Expenses to maintain this fleet are considered selling-related transportation costs, which include lease charges, depreciation, and fuel, and are typically reflected in all other SG&A expenses. We have a mix of leased and owned vehicles, and at December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 10,200 units.\nInformation Systems\nOur Information Systems teams develop, implement, secure, and maintain the computer-based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, digital, distribution center, and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations, while each selling location uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale system. The systems consist of custom in-house developed, purchased, and subscription licensed software. A dedicated Wide Area Network is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.\nTrademarks and Service Marks\nWe conduct business under various trademarks and service marks, and we utilize a variety of designs and taglines in connection with each of these marks, including Where Industry Meets Innovation™. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the 'Fastenal' name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, various trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the U.S. as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.\nProducts\nFastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies. This includes threaded fasteners, bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers, as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as pins, machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories. Our fastener product line, which is primarily sold under the Fastenal product name, represented 30.7% of our consolidated sales in 2024.\nFastener distribution is complex. In most cases, the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight. This presents challenges in moving product from suppliers, most of whom are outside of North America, to our distribution centers, as well as from our distribution centers to our in-market and customer locations. At the same time, fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products, construction projects, and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application. In many cases, a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime and/or effective use. These features have greatly influenced our logistical development, training and educational programs, support capabilities, and inventory decisions, which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate.\nIn 1993, we began to aggressively add additional product lines, and these represented 69.3% of our consolidated sales in 2024. These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending.\nThe largest category of non-fastener products is our safety supplies product line, which accounted for 22.2% of our consolidated sales in 2024. This product line has seen significant sales growth in the last 10 years, which we believe is directly attributable to our success cross-selling safety supplies to customers that utilize us for non-safety products, as well as our ability to market, deploy, and service industrial vending over that period. We expect these variables to remain the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line.\nWe plan to continue to add other product lines in the future.\nIn the last several decades, we have added 'private label' brands (often referred to as 'Exclusive Brands', or brands sold exclusively through Fastenal) to our non-fastener offering. Prior to 2023, each of our product categories tended to have its own private label. In 2023, we consolidated these into two labels: Body Guard®, which is our long-standing brand for North American safety supplies, and ORMADUS®, which is our global brand encompassing the remainder of our product offerings. These private label brands represented approximately 12% of our consolidated sales in 2024. We believe it is also appropriate \nto think about our private label sales as a percentage of our non-fastener sales for two reasons: (1) there is not a well-defined branded versus private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non-fasteners; and (2) non-fastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers, who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business. Private label brand sales represented approximately 17% of our total non-fastener sales in 2024. Over time we expect our private label sales as a percentage of our total non-fastener sales to increase, although oftentimes, these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with Onsite locations, which typically have a lower percentage of total sales of private label than in branches or sales through vending devices.\nDetailed information about our sales by product line is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K. Each product line may contain multiple product categories.\nInventory Control\nOur inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, by our sales personnel at in-market locations, and by our district and regional leadership. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations, from individual selling locations, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information. Our computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum stocking level. In the past we have utilized a base inventory model for all of our branches, and such a model still exists in a smaller subset of our locations. Increasingly, however, branches primarily stock inventory that is deemed to be appropriate by the district and branch personnel to service the customers within their selling territory. Similarly, non-branch selling locations (primarily Onsites) stock inventory exclusively based on customer-specific arrangements. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call 'inventory re-distribution'.\nInventory held at our selling locations, close to customers and available on a same-day basis, accounted for approximately 59% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. Inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 41% of our total inventory at the end of 2024. The distribution center and manufacturing location inventory, when combined with our trucking network, allows for fast, next-day service at a very competitive cost.\nManufacturing and Support Services Operations\nIn 2024, approximately 96% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements. The remaining 4% related to products manufactured, modified, or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our industrial services. These manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers' specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations, or standard sizes manufactured under our Holo-Krome®, Cardinal Fasteners®, and Spensall® product lines. These manufacturing products represent approximately 7% of our fastener sales. The services provided by the industrial services group include, but are not limited to, tool and hoist repair, chain sling and hose fabrication, band saw blade welding, packaging, and other light manufacturing and fabrication. We may add additional services in the future. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect the services to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 6% of our consolidated net sales in the future.\nSources of Supply\nWe use a diverse group of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control, strong relationships, reliable lead times, and effective costing. During 2024, we had a single supplier that accounted for more than 5% of our inventory purchases, whereas all remaining suppliers fell below that threshold.\nIn the case of fasteners and our private label non-fastener products, we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area, Asia. Within Asia, suppliers in China and Taiwan represent a significant source of product. Further, in many cases where we source directly from a North American supplier, the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the supplier's Asian facilities. As a result, the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions.\nBeyond inventory, we have some concentration of purchasing activity. For example, we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet, and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment. However, we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these, if necessary.\nCustomers and Marketing\nOur model is built around a broad product offering, timely fulfillment processes, convenient physical locations, extensive digital and services capabilities, and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. We believe we are successful because of our ability to integrate these features into supply chain solutions that are tailored to the specific challenges \nof our customer's operations. When deployed effectively, we have demonstrated the ability to assume responsibility for portions of our customer's sourcing operations while reducing the cost, lowering the risk, and increasing the scalability of our customer's supply chains. Our value proposition is focused on improving the operating effectiveness and reducing the total cost of ownership of our customer's supply chains.\nApproximately 70% to 75% of our customers are in manufacturing end markets, which encompasses heavy machinery, fabricated products, process industries (oil & gas, petrochemical, mining, pulp and paper, etc.), and transportation components (automotive, aerospace, etc.). We provide both the OEM and MRO needs of these customers. The remaining 25% to 30% of our customers fall primarily into non-residential construction (general and commercial contractors), reseller (retail and wholesale trades, dealers, and rental businesses), transportation services (air, train, maritime or truck transport, as well as warehousing and fulfillment centers), and state and local government entities, including schools, school districts, and universities.\nBased on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing, our business has historically been cyclical. However, we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes. First, we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing market. While slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries, locally or globally, we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions. Second, while a meaningful part of our sales is derived from products that are incorporated into final products, the greater proportion of our sales is derived from products used to maintain facilities. This latter source of sales tends to be impacted by cyclical forces, but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic.\nApproximately 72% of our consolidated sales in 2024 were with customers whose spend was subject to a contractual agreement between ourselves and the customer. The terms and conditions of these contracts will vary from customer to customer, with the most common features being the scope of products and services rendered, product and service pricing, payment terms, delivery expectations, quality obligations, warranty and liability exposure, and contract duration. Many contracts will also incorporate expectations for direct (e.g., cost) or indirect (e.g., process productivity and efficiency) savings that are expected to be achieved over the course of the contract and the interval at which progress toward these expectations will be reviewed. \nOur contractual programs fall into three broad categories:\n•National accounts represent the largest proportion of our contract business, accounting for 63% of our consolidated sales in 2024. This program is aimed at multi-location customers where the scale and scope of the OEM and MRO products that need to be managed are very complex and costly. We believe our broad product offering coupled with our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint, our ability to provide a consistent level of high-touch service, and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing, quality control, and product knowledge, are attractive to these multi-site customers. Further, we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other capabilities, such as Onsite, FMI, digital solutions, and resources to serve these customers' unique demands.\n•Local and regional contracts tend to establish terms and conditions for a customer's locations that have a more limited geographic scope, typically falling within an individual district or region. The scale and scope of the products and services that are addressed tend to be narrower and less complex than is the case for national account agreements. Some agreements cover the entirety of a customer's operations where the locations are focused in a specific geographic territory. Other agreements may represent a subset of a customer's North American or global operations, with additional locations either covered by separate local and regional contracts, being serviced on a transactional basis, or not being serviced at all. In the former case, we often try to migrate the customer to a national agreement.\n•Government contracts establish Fastenal as an approved supplier of MRO products to facilities managed by local, state, or municipal authorities. We do not generate meaningful direct sales from federal government agencies. These agreements are not different in function from local and regional non-government contracts. However, they generally involve different priorities, are heavily influenced by stricter regulatory obligations, and require specialized knowledge and processes to negotiate and maintain compliance. \nWe anticipate sales to contract customers will increase as a percentage of our total sales over time.\n\n2024                                           2023           2022           2021           2020           2019           2018\nActive Accounts              100,052        105,448        119,583        130,020        137,380        152,491        156,069\nKey Accounts                  39,467         39,266         39,151         36,190         33,794         34,621         32,895\nOur basic unit of measurement of customer business activity in an in-market location is an active account, which is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $100 per month. Customers often have more than one active account at a single in-market location, reflecting their utilization of different Fastenal services, and frequently have active accounts at many in-market locations across our global network. In 2024, approximately 99.5% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our active accounts, with the remainder being from walk-in or infrequent, non-account, and small account customers. We have reported on the quantity of our active accounts annually, as set forth in the table above. The table also includes a subset of our active accounts, called 'key accounts'. This is defined as any customer account with purchase activity of at least $2,000 per month. Key accounts have been a greater focus of our selling activities since 2020 because they typically utilize a wider range of our products and services, and in 2024, approximately 93.2% of the sales in our in-market locations were derived from our key accounts.\nDuring 2024, no single customer represented 5% or more of our consolidated net sales.\nDirect marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local in-market selling personnel, as well as our non-branch selling personnel. We support our sales team with multi-channel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing, print and radio advertising, targeted campaigns, promotional flyers, and events. Our national advertising has been focused on a NASCAR® sponsorship serving as a primary partner of Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing®, which stands as one of the longest tenured-brands in NASCAR. In 2020, our sports marketing efforts were extended when the National Hockey League (NHL®) awarded us as the preferred MRO supplier of the sport.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality has some impact on our sales. The first and fourth quarters of each year are typically our lower volume periods, given their overlap with winter months in North America during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the non-residential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather. The fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the Thanksgiving (October in Canada and November in the U.S.), Christmas, and New Year holiday periods, due to plant shut downs. In contrast, the second and third quarters of each year typically have higher sales due to stronger non-residential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays (although Good Friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of July will always fall in the third quarter).\nCompetition\nOur business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas, and smaller regional or local distributors, which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products, in no particular order, are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.\nMarket strategies in industrial distribution are varied. With respect to products, many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broad-line offering over time; however, they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share. This association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors, though many smaller competitors do deploy a broad-line model. Means of serving the customer are even more diverse. For instance, many competitors maintain a local, branch-based presence in their markets, while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses, while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales. Recent years have seen the emergence of eBusiness solutions, such as websites, and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors, it also has introduced non-traditional web-based competitors into the marketplace. The diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base. The large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels, from a single distributor or a range of distributors, to procure the products they need in their operations.\nWe believe that better service, and a competitive selling advantage, can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers' location(s). As a result, we maintain in-market locations in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products. The convenience of a large number of in-market locations in a given area, combined with our ability to provide them with frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers, facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our FMI solutions, supported by an in-market location, provide a unique way to serve our customers with convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each in-market location also enhances our ability to compete (see 'Employees' below).\nOur Onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers. Building on our core business strategy of the local branch, the Onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers, all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure.\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmployees\nAt the end of 2024, we employed 23,702 full- and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 71% held a selling role. We characterize these personnel as follows:\n\n2024                                                              % of Total            2023                    % of Total\nSelling personnel (1)                           16,712            70.5     %      16,512                        71.2     %\nDistribution/Transportation personnel            4,211            17.8     %       4,042                        17.4     %\nManufacturing personnel                            752             3.2     %         733                         3.2     %\nOrganizational support personnel (2)             2,027             8.5     %       1,914                         8.2     %\nTotal personnel                                 23,702           100.0     %      23,201                       100.0     %\n\n      (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n      (2)        Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales &amp; Growth Driver Support personnel (35%-40% of category), which includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology personnel (35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (22% to 27% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of Business (FSB), accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nEmployee Profile\nOf the employees noted above, 18,701 are located in the U.S., 3,304 are located in Canada and Mexico, and 1,697 are located overseas in 23 other countries throughout the world.\nBased on our EEO-1 data for 2024, in the U.S., females and minorities constitute 24.1% and 24.3% of our workforce, respectively. We believe these absolute figures gain further context when viewed against two additional data sets. First, over the past ten years there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business. Since 2014, our female and minority workforces have grown 2.3x and 4.4x faster, respectively, than our overall U.S. workforce. This trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution, including the natural progression of our geographic expansion, the cycle of our promote-from-within philosophy, and efforts to improve hiring processes over time. Second, based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we believe Fastenal's mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction, which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates. For instance, relative to the 24.1% of our U.S. workforce that is female, the proportion of females in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 29.3% and 11.2%, respectively. Similarly, relative to the 24.3% of our U.S. workforce that are minorities, the proportion of non-white (a definition utilized by the U.S. Census Bureau) individuals in the U.S. manufacturing and construction workforces are 22.2% and 12.7%, respectively.\nHealth and Safety\nEmployee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business. We have taken a multi-faceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business. Today, our health and safety programs span all operations including manufacturing, distribution centers, fleet and auto, and our branch and Onsite network. These key business units play a dynamic role in defining how we engage with our employees on health and safety. Trainings, audits, inspections, risk assessments, safety coaching, and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility safety and employee safety. In 2024, there were over 247,000 completed health and safety engagements, which is an increase of 16% compared to 2023. Our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance. We continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows.\nThis commitment to, and continuous improvement toward, a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results. A widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the Experience Modification Rate (EMR). An organization's EMR is established through the comparison of a company's past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages, which are compiled by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization. Industry averages are benchmarked at a 1.00 EMR, with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization's ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols, resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk. In 2024, Fastenal had an EMR of 0.46, which is 54% better than the average performance rate for our industry.\nIn 2024, we achieved third-party re-certification for the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This certification illustrates the strength of our health and safety programs, as well as our commitment to continual improvement to better support our growing workforce. As our business model continues to grow through our branch and Onsite network, our customer critical programs have evolved to mitigate risk and incidents, while meeting customer specific needs. This partnership with our customers allows us to collaborate and expand our health and safety programs to enhance our customers' workplace safety performance.\nEmployment and Compensation Philosophy\nFastenal's success is defined by our people. Our cultural values – Ambition, Integrity, Innovation, and Teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols, and inform our employment and compensation philosophies.\nSeveral principles underpin our employment philosophy. One principle is decentralization: placing employees close to our customers' operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service. A second principle is that we are a passionately promote-from-within company, guided by a belief that if you work hard, make great decisions, learn from mistakes, and exemplify our cultural values, you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility. We believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment.\nAs it relates to our compensation philosophy, we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success, as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort. We are guided by simple principles. First, compensation programs should be easy to understand, with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided. They should be calculable by the employee and numbers-driven (e.g., not subjective). Second, total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers. Third, employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal.\nApproximately 71% of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis, with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customer-facing employees. Typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month, along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts, paid monthly, based on growth in sales, gross or pre-tax profit achieved, and prudent management of working capital. In certain roles, there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals, most of which are focused on either customer service or better execution of company-wide activities.\nBecause we believe the growth in our stock value should be the reward for achieving long-term success consistent with being an owner, we have a stock option plan. In the case of certain foreign employees, we have a stock appreciation rights plan. All of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights.\nWe believe our combination of short- and long-term rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and levels of employee retention and turnover.\nOur employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.\nTalent Acquisition and Development\nFastenal's values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership. The ultimate goal is straightforward: find great people, ask them to join, and give them a reason to stay. Reasons to stay include training, opportunity, and a welcoming environment. From a practical standpoint, this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities. In accordance with our decentralized leadership structure, we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening. In light of our promote-from-within philosophy, we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire.\nOur Human Resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage. We have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions, supplemented with training through the FSB. We have a Diversity and Compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework, which ensures its integrity. Not only is this process followed for all new hires, we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions.\nThe FSB (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company-specific training and development programs that are offered to our employees. The programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructor-led training, virtual instructor-led training, and online learning. FSB provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees' performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning, as well as training plans based on roles within Fastenal. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business, such as leadership, effective best practices, sales and marketing, products, supply chain, and distribution.\nProduct Sourcing Endeavors\nSourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain. We expect our suppliers to comply with all relevant regulations and applicable standards. Our teams conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us and require them to provide additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics, quality, and reliability. This ensures they meet our standards in these areas and are complying with Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. Utilizing third-party tools and global databases, Fastenal actively monitors government sanctions, denied party listings, withhold release orders, export restriction updates, financial status, adverse media, and multiple other official exclusion lists that provide information on any known risk of any entities and locations with which Fastenal engages, and screens all business partners against those lists. Additionally, we monitor key areas of trade-related risk, including dual-use goods, trade cases, anti-dumping and counter-vailing cases, and other protectionist trade measures for all countries that products are traded in. As part of our comprehensive Supply Chain Security program, we also evaluate our suppliers' approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate, and appropriately compensated, employees and ensure upstream supply chain visibility on globally sourced products.\nWith a local and global supplier base, continuous evaluation and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are flagged when risk may be evident, ensuring a safeguard against poor and/or impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation or ability to effectively operate in the marketplace. This is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding, but for the life of the relationship with the supplier. This process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of Fastenal's Global Supplier Purchase Order Terms & Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct. In the event of non-compliance or potential risk, we work with the supplier to correct the situation. If remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with Fastenal's standards and code of conduct, alternative sources of supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance, ensuring that no matter where a customers' operations may take them, Fastenal has the infrastructure, resources, and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations.\nIn 2024, approximately 26% of our total company-wide inventory spend was with small and/or diverse businesses. This flows from our Supplier Diversity program, as part of which we are committed to building supply chain relationships with small businesses and businesses with diverse ownership.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet address for corporate and investor information is www.fastenal.com.

      "text": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows:\nCompany-Specific Risks\nOperational Risks\nProducts that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage, environmental damage, personal injury, or death linked to the use of those products by our customers. Some of our customers operate in challenging industries in which there is a material risk of catastrophic events. We are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers, some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk. If any of these events are linked to the use of any of our products by our customers, claims could be brought against us by those customers, by governmental authorities, and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them, we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place, the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available, or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems, or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner, could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in sales, and result in less efficient operations. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner. Our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities. Still, information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, cybersecurity incidents, telecommunication failures, and other problems. In addition, certain software used by us is licensed from, and certain services related to our information systems are provided by, third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us. It is also possible that we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our information systems. Our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of Fastenal and customer data, as well as the success of our growth drivers, is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems. If critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable, if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations, or if certain insurance coverages are limited in their capabilities or affordability, it could adversely affect our profitability and/or ability to grow.\nThe ability to adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations. Additionally, our business relies on the use, validity, and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which include current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements, as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect our rights. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject us to liability, require us to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost, or otherwise cause us to modify our operations.\nOur ability to successfully attract, develop, and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs, sales at existing selling locations, and the successful execution of our growth drivers. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including inside and outside branch associates, Onsite managers, national account sales representatives, and logistical and administrative support personnel, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high, particularly for less tenured employees. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels. \nCybersecurity incidents, or violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace. The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain, and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent such unauthorized access, and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event, including any cybersecurity event. The development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Consequently, despite our efforts, the possibility of cybersecurity incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a cybersecurity incident that may materially impact our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security were to occur, it could interrupt our operations, subject us to additional legal, regulatory, and operating costs, and damage our reputation in the marketplace. In addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data. Privacy security laws and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016, the California Consumer Protection Act, and other similar privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nChanges in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could continue to cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future. Changes in our customer and product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline. For example, we have experienced a sustained increase in the proportion of our sales attributable to both non-fastener products and national accounts and Onsite customers. Non-fastener products typically have a lower gross profit percentage than fasteners because in many cases non-fastener products are less technical, have shorter supply chains, and are easier to transport. Similarly, national accounts and Onsite customers typically have a lower gross profit percentage than smaller customers by virtue of their scale, available business, and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross profit percentages. Whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year or period will depend on the extent to which they are offset by positive impacts to gross profit percentage during such year or period. Setting aside the circumstances of any given year or period, however, customer and product mix have contributed to the decline of our gross profit percentage over time and, based on the anticipated sources of our future growth, will likely continue to reduce our gross profit percentage into the foreseeable future. There are other variables that could cause our gross profit percentage to decline, including downward pressure on sales prices due to deflation, increases in overseas freight charges, the inability of freight sales to leverage the expenses associated with our captive trucking fleet, pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition. We could experience reductions in the volume of purchases we make from our suppliers, which could reduce supplier volume allowances. We may not be able to pass higher product costs along to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace. We experienced a number of these variables in 2024. A softer manufacturing economy caused relative weakness in our more cyclical and higher gross margin fastener product line versus our non-fastener product lines. Similarly, we continued to execute initiatives aimed at accelerating key account penetration, which resulted in relative growth in our lower gross margin national account and Onsite customers. The combination of these two events produced pressure on our product gross profit percentage in 2024 from product and customer mix.\nOur SG&A expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales, which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging sales growth into higher net income. Over time, we have generally experienced an increase in our SG&A expenses, including costs related to payroll, occupancy, freight, and information technology, among others, as our net sales have grown. However, historically, a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales, allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins. There are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past. For instance, it is typical that when demand slows or declines, most commonly from cyclical or general market factors (although it could be due to customer losses or some other company-specific event), our SG&A expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales. It is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in SG&A expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales. In addition, market variables, which include but are not exclusive of labor rates, energy costs, legal costs, and health care costs, could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our SG&A expenses so as to leverage our sales growth into higher net income. We experienced a number of these variables in 2024. Specifically, a softer manufacturing economy and our continued investment in personnel to support Onsite growth caused our SG&A to grow faster than sales, resulting in pressure on our operating margin percentage.\nOur inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations. Our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership. In the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future, the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight and/or leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal, talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles. In addition, difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team, or recruiting suitable replacements, could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations. In December 2024, our Chief Financial Officer disclosed his intention to resign from Fastenal effective April 16, 2025. The process of filling this role is underway. However, failure to develop, attract, and retain a suitable replacement may have an adverse effect on our senior leadership team and our existing operations.\nOur competitive advantage in FMI solutions, which includes industrial vending (FASTVend) and bin stock (FASTStock and FASTBin) tools, could be eliminated and, in the case of FASTVend and FASTBin, the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices. Certain circumstances could lead to a short-term inability to promote and/or install our FMI solutions. We believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software, our local presence (allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly and with less burden on our customers), our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks, and, particularly in North America, our distribution strength. These advantages have developed over time; however, other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own. Such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business. In addition, we currently choose to rely on a limited number of suppliers for our vending devices, RFID technology, and IR technology used in our FASTVend and FASTBin platforms. While devices, software, and services can be obtained from other sources, loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in our failure to meet short- or long-term goals related to the numbers of FASTVend and FASTBin devices we are able to deploy. Certain circumstances may reduce short-term customer receptivity to adopting our FMI services. For instance, during periods of dramatic change in economic activity, some customers may prioritize managing existing operations over adopting new technologies until business circumstances change.\nWe may be affected by global climate change or legal, tax, regulatory, or market responses to such change. The concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or requirements, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers. In addition, many of the regulations that have been issued create mandatory, annual reporting requirements related to carbon emissions and other sustainability-related information that will ultimately be subject to audit. If we are unable to respond to any new regulatory or market changes in a timely fashion or at all in a way that satisfies regulators and/or our suppliers and customers, it could directly or indirectly affect our business, supply chains, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, climate change may present additional physical risks to our operations and lead to an increased frequency of unusual or extreme weather conditions, which could disrupt our supply chain or harm or disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers.\nWe may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business. Our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within North America and abroad. In recent years, we have increased the resources devoted to developing a multi-dimensional, differentiated service offering, including our Digital Footprint (which incorporates our FMI and eBusiness capabilities), Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, and process and consumption analytics. While we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business, we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth. Failure to achieve any of our goals regarding our Digital Footprint, Onsites, national accounts, international capabilities, analytics, or other growth drivers could negatively impact our long-term sales and profit growth. In addition, failure to identify appropriate targets for the growth drivers of our business or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our internally developed and/or externally communicated deployment objectives.\nThe ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our selling efforts and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete, our ability to generate additional sales, and our profit margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at our selling locations and through our specialist roles and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers' needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our selling locations and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins.\nThe ability to adequately protect our reputation may have an adverse impact on operations and profitability. The Fastenal name is valuable to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on our ability to provide high quality products, deliver consistent services, and improve our customers' business operations. Further, information on Fastenal, including our products and services, can be more easily accessed and more quickly disseminated through traditional and social media and digital channels. Should we fail to deliver a positive customer experience or should our public image be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based in fact, it could jeopardize our reputation and discourage customers from purchasing our products and services, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to grow our sales and profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or non-traditional competitors, which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although slowly consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented, and highly competitive industry. Our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, technological, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources, technological advancements, and services. Increased competition from brick-and-mortar retailers could cause us to lose market share, reduce our prices, or increase our spending. Similarly, the emergence of online retailers, whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major, non-traditional competitors, could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods. These pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross and/or operating income profit and/or percentage over time.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies. Historically, substantially all of our growth has been organic. However, we have completed several acquisitions over the last decade and expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including, among others, a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business, inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition, diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues, and risks related to the integration of the acquired business, including unanticipated changes in our business, our industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions.\nEquity Risks\nOur stock price will fluctuate, and at times these fluctuations may be volatile. The prices of markets and individual equities tend to fluctuate. These fluctuations commonly reflect events, many of which may be fully or partially outside of our control, that may change investors' perception of our future income growth prospects, including changes in economic conditions, ability to execute business strategy, the impacts of public policy, investor sentiment, competitive dynamics, and many other factors. While the sources of stock price fluctuation can be common across companies, the magnitude of these fluctuations can vary for different companies. This is commonly measured by beta, which is an individual stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. Our stock price has traditionally had a high beta value, which means fluctuations in the price of our shares will often be sharper than what is experienced by broader market indices. We can provide no assurance that the above-average historical volatility of our stock versus the broader market will moderate. Volatility in our stock price could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management's time, attention, and resources.\nThere can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of income over time. Stock prices, including ours, are commonly thought to be a function of income compounded by a multiple. This is often referred to as a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, although other forms of multiples are often utilized by investors to value Fastenal shares. Historically, investors have given our income a higher multiple, or premium, than is typical of the broader industrial sector with which we are typically associated. We believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth, profitability, and returns. However, to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies and/or poorly navigate the risks that surround our business, including those described throughout this section, or to the extent our industry (industrial distribution, or industrial stocks in general) loses favor in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our income, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program. Although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates. In addition, although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2022, 2020, and prior years through these programs, we may discontinue doing so at any time. Any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, to increase those dividends, or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations, the price of our common stock, credit conditions, and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nGeneral Economic and Operating Risks\nOperational Risks\nProducts manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available, which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results. We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, and other foreign countries. Our suppliers could discontinue or experience disruption in selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers' control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations, disruption in trade relationships and agreements, political unrest, war, disease, labor availability, or changes in local economic conditions. Additionally, the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial, capacity, or other difficulties. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing products and services of comparable quality and utility. \nA downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results. In general, our sales are the result of planned and unplanned customer spending on products used in production of final goods, infrastructure construction, and/or the maintenance of facilities. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others:\n•general business conditions;\n•business conditions in our principal markets;\n•changes in the value of local currencies relative to our functional currency, the U.S. dollar;\n•interest rates;\n•increases (inflation) or decreases (deflation) in the cost of products from our vendors, transportation services, energy and fuel prices, and electrical power rates;\n•liquidity in credit markets;\n•taxation;\n•government regulations and actions;\n•the impact on customer demand or availability of goods and services based on labor shortages or work stoppages;\n•unemployment trends;\n•terrorist attacks and acts of war;\n•impact of higher sustained global temperatures (climate change);\n•acts of God, which may include, but are not limited to, weather events, earthquakes, pandemics, etc.; and\n•other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.\nA downturn in either the national or local economies where we operate, or in the principal markets served by us, or changes in any of the other factors described above, could negatively impact sales at our in-market locations, sales through our other selling channels, and the level of profitability of those in-market locations and other selling channels. The primary variable affecting our results in 2024 was a softening in manufacturing sector business conditions.\nTrade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult and/or more costly, and could adversely impact our gross and/or operating profit percentage. We source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of North America, primarily Asia. We have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from Asia through our wholly-owned, Asia-based subsidiary, FASTCO Trading Co., Ltd., and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources. This was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production, but over time we have expanded our non-fastener sourcing as well, and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term. In light of this, changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations, our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers and/or impact the cost or price of our products, with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results. China represents a significant source of product for North America. In \naddition, we move and source products within North America. Any trading disruption (tariffs, product restrictions, etc.) between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business. On February 1, 2025, the White House issued three executive orders directing the U.S. to impose an increase of the duty on imports from Canada and Mexico and China and empowering the U.S. president to raise the tariffs further should any country retaliate.  On February 3, 2025, the prospective tariffs on Canada and Mexico were deferred for 30 days, though the execution of these tariff increases remain possible beyond the current short-term reprieve. The 10% additional tariff on all imports from China went into effect, and on February 4, 2025 China retaliated with various levels of tariffs on certain products imported into that country from the U.S. We are closely monitoring these actions, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future, with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business. The degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies, their timing and duration, and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues.\nChanges in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales, cost of sales, gross profit percentage, distribution expenses, and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating income. Our suppliers can experience significant fluctuation over time in the cost of raw materials (e.g., steel, plastic, etc.) used to produce their products. They can also experience significant fluctuation in the cost of energy consumed in their production processes and in the cost of fuel consumed to transport their products. These suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. We also consume energy and fuel in our own operations, and can experience direct and significant fluctuation in our own costs. Increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit to decline, or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries, which could cause our sales to those customers to decline. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income. \nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales. Given that we were founded and remain based in the U.S. and that we are publicly traded in the U.S., we report our results based on the U.S. dollar. Because the functional currency related to most of our non-U.S. operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar as our Mexican activities are primarily conducted in U.S. dollars and our non-North American operations are relatively small in scale. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure. If we decide to do so in the future, we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \nOur current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect. We believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that North American market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed $140 billion. This figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreed-upon demand and market share statistics. Instead, we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources. If we have overestimated the size of our market, and in doing so, underestimated our current share of it, the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe. Similarly, we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies, such as FMI solutions and Onsite locations. Within North America, we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 1.7 million devices and we have identified over 11,000 customer locations with the potential to implement our Onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base. We have identified additional markets, such as government, healthcare, and academia, and geographies into which we can sell our FMI solutions, which would increase the number of identified potential FMI solutions or Onsite locations. However, our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies, which could extend the sales cycle. As is the case for total market size, we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources. These estimates are based on our business model today, and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies could cause them to change. In addition, the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace (such as changes in customer concentration or needs), a change in the nature of that business strategy, or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or Onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity.\nThe industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share, gross profit, and operating income. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating, reflecting two factors. First, our customers' needs are evolving to reflect a greater awareness of the total cost and risk of fulfillment and their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations, including outside of North America. Second, providing these capabilities to our customers requires increasing investment in hardware, software, and analytic capabilities that require a certain degree of scale to support. While we believe that in a fragmented market such as exists for industrial supplies these emerging trends favor large distributors such as Fastenal, as the industry consolidates into fewer and larger competitors it may become more difficult to differentiate our product and service offering from that of our competitors. We also continue to see consolidation among our suppliers. This trend could result in fewer and larger suppliers, with greater channel power and negotiating leverage. There can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation within our industry or among our suppliers. In either or both cases, the trend toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our growth and/or gross and operating profit. Furthermore, as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors, or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share.\nThe occurrence of a widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A public health crisis, if sufficiently widespread as to affect economic activity, could negatively impact our business. Mitigation efforts and prescriptions may be facilitated by regulatory authorities, which could limit our flexibility to pursue alternative, potentially more favorable, means of limiting these negative impacts. The effects on our business efforts to mitigate the effects of the crisis may include a reduction in demand, inefficiencies due to workplace accommodations, reduced availability of personnel, supply chain disruption, or constraints on product availability, among other difficulties. In any such event, the severity, duration, and extent of the crisis can be difficult to predict, which can make it difficult to anticipate the magnitude and length of the impact on our sales, profits, and/or cash flow. It can also be difficult to anticipate what the effect on business conditions will be as the impacts of any public health crisis fade and mitigating policies are reversed. \nInclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions. \nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and/or financial reporting could materially impact our business and results. Fastenal's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. Any system of internal controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all systems of internal controls, internal controls over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes and financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation, economic loss, or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, damage to our reputation, or the termination of contracts. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption laws, product compliance laws, environmental laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, advertising regulations, data privacy (including in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016, with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products, labor and employment laws, and anti-competition regulations. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation, administration, and performance of our governmental contracts. We are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business. Ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business, and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance \nwith these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts. \nTax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results. We are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties. Further, our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected, positively or negatively, by changing tax priorities, changes in statutory rates, and/or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof, including any changes resulting from the new presidential administration in the U.S. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, which contained tax-related provisions. We did not experience, and do not anticipate experiencing in the near future, any meaningful impact to our tax rates from the legislation.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and legal matters, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal processes, internal control, and other changes that could increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from business transactions or the operation of our business. Due to the nature of our business, these proceedings may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, suits arising from our trucking operations, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor, intellectual property matters, or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCredit and Liquidity Risks\nTight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results. As of December 31, 2024, we had $200.0 of outstanding debt obligations, all in the form of senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement). The notes issued under our Master Note Agreement carry a fixed interest rate and consist of four series and are described in further detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We also have borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) of $835.0, but no loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. Loans under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the rate on which may vary daily, and mature on September 28, 2027.\nWe currently have the capacity under our Credit Facility and Master Note Agreement to increase borrowings in the future to finance stock purchases, dividends, capital expenditures, working capital additions, acquisitions, or other investments. Should we seek to increase our borrowings during periods of volatility and disruption in the U.S. credit markets, financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain. This was not a material consideration in 2024. The cost of servicing any existing balances on our Credit Facility could increase if interest rates increase due to the SOFR-based interest rate provided for under our Credit Facility.",
