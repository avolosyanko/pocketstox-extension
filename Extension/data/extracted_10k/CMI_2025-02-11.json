      "text": "ITEM 1.    Business\nOVERVIEW \nWe were founded in 1919 as Cummins Engine Company, a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. In 2001, we changed our name to Cummins Inc. We are a global power solutions leader comprised of five business segments - Engine, Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Accelera - supported by our global manufacturing and extensive service and support network, skilled workforce and vast technical expertise. Our products range from advanced diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrain-related components including aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, valvetrain technologies, controls systems, air handling systems, automated transmissions, axles, drivelines, brakes, suspension systems, electric power generation systems, electrified power systems with innovative components and subsystems, including battery, fuel cell and electric power technologies and hydrogen production technologies. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, dealers and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a service network of approximately 650 wholly-owned, joint venture and independent distributor locations and more than 19,000 Cummins certified dealer locations in approximately 190 countries and territories.\nDivestiture of Atmus\nOn March 18, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our remaining 80.5 percent ownership of Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. (Atmus) common stock through a tax-free split-off. The exchange resulted in a reduction of shares of our common stock outstanding by 5.6 million shares and a gain of approximately $1.3 billion. See NOTE 21, \"ATMUS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) AND DIVESTITURE,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSettlement Agreements\nIn December 2023, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the California Attorney General’s Office to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S., which became final and effective in April 2024 (collectively, the Settlement Agreements). In the second quarter of 2024, we made $1.9 billion of payments required by the Settlement Agreements. See NOTE 14, “COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nWe have five complementary operating segments: Engine, Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Accelera. These segments share technology, customers, strategic partners, brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. \nWe use segment earnings or losses before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA) as the basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. See NOTE 25, \"OPERATING SEGMENTS,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income.\nEngine Segment\nEngine segment sales and EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated results were: \n\n                                                                                                Years ended December 31,\n                                                                    2024                    2023                    2022\nPercent of consolidated net sales (1)                             28   %                  28   %                  31   %\nPercent of consolidated EBITDA (1)                                33   %                  32   %                  38   %\n(1) Measured before intersegment eliminations                                                                           \nThe Engine segment manufactures and markets a broad range of diesel and natural gas-powered engines under the Cummins brand name, as well as certain customer brand names, for the heavy-duty truck, medium-duty truck and bus, light-duty automotive and off-highway markets.

Our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in China and are included in the list below. Our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our Components segment in the same manner as it supplies our wholly-owned Engine segment and Power Systems segment manufacturing facilities. Our Components segment joint ventures and wholly-owned entities provide axles, drivelines, brakes and suspension systems for commercial diesel and natural gas applications, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems, valvetrain technologies, automated transmissions and electronics that are used with our engines as well as some competitors' products. The results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent or less ownership interest (except for ECJV, which is consolidated due to our majority voting interest) discussed below are included in equity, royalty and interest income from investees and investments and advances related to equity method investees in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\n•Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. - Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) is a joint venture in China with Dongfeng Automotive Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Corporation and one of the largest medium-duty and heavy-duty truck manufacturers in China. DCEC produces 3.9 liter to 14.5 liter diesel engines with a power range from 80 to 760 horsepower, natural gas engines and automated transmissions. On-highway engines are used in multiple applications in light-duty and medium-duty trucks, special purpose vehicles, buses and heavy-duty trucks with a main market in China. Off-highway engines are used in a variety of construction, power generation, marine and agriculture markets in China. \n•Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. - Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. is a joint venture in China with Chongqing Machinery and Electric Co. Ltd. This joint venture manufactures several models of our heavy-duty and high-horsepower diesel engines primarily serving the industrial and stationary power markets in China.\n•Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. is a joint venture in China with Beiqi Foton Motor Co., Ltd., a commercial vehicle manufacturer, which has two distinct lines of business - a light-duty business and a heavy-duty business. The light-duty business produces our families of ISF 2.5 liter to 4.5 liter high performance light-duty diesel engines in Beijing. These engines are used in light-duty and medium-duty commercial trucks, pick-up trucks, buses, multipurpose and sport utility vehicles with main markets in China and Brazil. Certain types of small construction equipment and industrial applications are also served by these engine families. The heavy-duty business produces 7.0 liter to 14.5 liter high performance heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines in Beijing. Certain types of construction equipment and industrial applications are also served by these engine families.\n•Tata Cummins, Ltd. - Tata Cummins, Ltd. is a joint venture in India with Tata Motors Ltd., the largest automotive company in India and a member of the Tata group of companies. This joint venture manufactures Cummins' 3.8 to 8.9 liter diesel and natural gas engines in India with a power range from 75 to 400 horsepower for use in trucks and buses manufactured by Tata Motors, as well as for various on-highway, industrial and power generation applications for Cummins.\nIn September 2023, our Accelera business signed an agreement to form a joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies LLC, with Daimler Truck, PACCAR and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery supply chain in the U.S., including building a 21-gigawatt hour battery production facility in Marshall County, Mississippi. The joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. The joint venture received all government approvals and began operations in May 2024, but is not expected to begin production until 2027. The joint venture meets the definition of a variable interest entity since the equity-at-risk is not currently sufficient to support the future operations of the joint venture. Accelera, Daimler Truck and PACCAR each own 30 percent of the joint venture and have two board positions, while EVE Energy owns 10 percent and has one board position. All significant decisions require majority or super-majority approval of the board. As a result, we are not the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, and the joint venture is not consolidated. We account for the joint venture using the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, we had contributed $211 million, and our maximum remaining required contribution to the joint venture was $619 million, which could be reduced by future government incentives received by the joint venture. In addition, we are required to purchase 33 percent of the joint venture's output in the future or be subject to certain penalties. \nDistribution Entity\nKomatsu Cummins Chile, Ltda. - Komatsu Cummins Chile, Ltda. is a joint venture with Komatsu America Corporation. The joint venture is a distributor that offers the full range of our products and services to customers and end-users in Chile and Peru. See further discussion of our distribution network under the Distribution segment section above.\nNon-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries\n•Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies - We have a majority voting interest in ECJV by virtue of a tie-breaking vote on the joint venture’s board of directors. ECJV develops and supplies automated transmissions for the heavy-duty commercial vehicle markets in North America and China.\n•Cummins India Ltd. - We have a controlling interest in Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in India. CIL produces medium-duty, heavy-duty and high-horsepower diesel engines and generators for the Indian and export markets and natural gas spark-ignited engines for power generation, automotive and industrial applications. CIL also has distribution and power generation operations.\nSUPPLY\nThe performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, as we strive to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers.\nWe use a combination of proactive and reactive methodologies to enhance our understanding of supply base risks, which guide the development of risk monitoring and sourcing strategies. We use a process that groups products or services into categories based on similar characteristics, which helps us align our purchasing goals with overall business objectives (Category Strategy Framework). Our Category Strategy Framework process supports the review of our long-term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For externally purchased items, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should consider for long-term supply agreements to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines, power generation units, drivetrain and braking systems and Accelera products. Key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that seek to secure capacity, delivery and quality and to assure cost requirements are met over an extended period. \nOther important elements of our sourcing strategy include the following:\n•expanding risk management scope to include sub-tier value chain suppliers for critical components; \n•broadening dual and multi-sourcing where applicable;\n•selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct; and\n•assuring our suppliers comply with our prohibited and restricted materials policy.\nDisruption risk in certain categories of our supply chains exist and could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. We continue to monitor the supply chain disruptions utilizing early detection methods complemented by structured supplier risk and resiliency assessments. We increased frequency of formal and informal supplier engagement to address potentially impactful supply base constraints and enhanced collaboration to develop specific countermeasures to mitigate risks. \nPATENTS AND TRADEMARKS\nWe own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.\nSEASONALITY\nWhile individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis.\nLARGEST CUSTOMERS\nWe have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for 16 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024, 16 percent in 2023 and 16 percent in 2022. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty and medium-duty engines and aftertreatment systems. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines or aftertreatment systems. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2024. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have supplied engines to PACCAR for 80 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.\nIn addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty and medium-duty engine and aftertreatment system supply agreements with Traton and Daimler. We also have an agreement with Stellantis to supply engines and aftertreatment products for its pick-up truck applications. Collectively, our net sales to these four customers, including PACCAR, were 36 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024, 37 percent in 2023 and 36 percent in 2022. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024, less than 9 percent in 2023 and less than 8 percent in 2022. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine, aftertreatment and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help provide for the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. \nBACKLOG\nDisruption risk in certain categories of our supply chains exist and could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs and firm orders from data center and electrolyzer customers, however a large portion of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. Many of these open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. We continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers to meet the demand.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIn 2024, we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission standards around the world, improvements in fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gas-powered engines and related components, as well as development activities around electrified power systems with innovative components and systems including battery and electric power technologies and hydrogen production technologies.\nOur research and development programs are focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical IT expenses, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. When not associated with a sales contract, we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, \nwere $1.4 billion in 2024, $1.4 billion in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2022. Contract reimbursements were $72 million, $81 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY \nWe are committed to making people's lives better by powering a more prosperous world. That prosperity includes strong communities, robust business and environmental sustainability. \nOur Board of Directors (the Board) and the senior management team oversee our top risks, while the Enterprise Risk Management program gives the Board and senior management a framework to help them understand, identify, assess, manage and monitor risks so we can meet our strategic objectives. The Board is ultimately responsible for assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Managing risk effectively is on the agenda at every regular board meeting, and the Board reviews the entire Enterprise Risk Management program and the results of our latest enterprise risk assessment each year. As climate-related risks affect all aspects of the business, the enterprise risks incorporate, where relevant, climate-related aspects, with a separate stand-alone enterprise risk on climate change.\nThe Safety, Environment and Technology (SET) committee provides overall guidance and insight on major environmental sustainability initiatives such as our environmental sustainability strategy, as well as environmental management at our facilities and operations. \nIn 2019, we introduced our current environmental sustainability strategy focused on three priority areas: addressing climate change and air emissions, using natural resources in the most sustainable way and improving communities. Additional commitments followed including Cummins Water Works, our program for strengthening communities through sustainable water and addressing the global water crisis, and Destination Zero, our long-term product decarbonization strategy. \nThe environmental sustainability strategy includes nine specific goals to achieve by 2030, including science-based greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for newly sold products and facilities, as well as aspirational targets for 2050. We started reporting progress on these nine goals, most of which have a baseline year of 2018, in 2022. Key actions in 2024 included completing the planned capital spending to meet the 2030 facility reduction goals for GHG emissions, water and waste; improving GHG measurement and modeling for product emissions; and identifying technology portfolio opportunities toward progress of product GHG reduction. In 2024, we also initiated a planned midpoint review of our 2030 sustainability goals. This review reflected standard governance practices to ensure our metrics, scope and strategies remain aligned with evolving conditions and our long-term objectives. Our commitment to progress remains steadfast, and we anticipate sharing any updates or adjustments to these goals in 2025.\nThe nine goals for 2030 are as follows:\n•Reduce absolute GHG emissions from facilities and operations by 50 percent.\n•Reduce scope three absolute lifetime GHG emissions from newly sold products by 25 percent.\n•Partner with customers to reduce scope three GHG emissions from products in the field by 55 million metric tons.\n•Reduce volatile organic compounds emissions from paint and coating operations by 50 percent.\n•Create a circular lifecycle plan for every part to use less, use better, use again.\n•Generate 25 percent less waste in facilities and operations as percent of revenue.\n•Reuse or responsibly recycle 100 percent of packaging plastics and eliminate single-use plastics in dining facilities, employee amenities and events.\n•Reduce absolute water consumption in facilities and operations by 30 percent.\n•Produce net water benefits that exceed our annual water use in all our regions.\nOur most recent Sustainability Progress Report and previous reports are available on our website at www.cummins.com/company/esg/sustainability-progress-reports. Our annual submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for climate and water is also available on our website. The CDP climate submission provides information on our scenario planning for climate and other risks, as well as detailed emissions data as requested by CDP. We also published a report in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework. These reports are not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference. \nWe continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged around the world to promote science-based climate policies by working with regulatory, industry and other stakeholders, including joining advocacy groups and testifying before legislators and regulators. We will continue to work in partnership with others to advocate for tough, clear and enforceable regulations around the globe to address air and GHG emissions. \nENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE \nSettlement Agreements \nIn December 2023, we announced that we reached an agreement in principle with the EPA, CARB, DOJ and the California Attorney General’s Office to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S., which became final and effective in April 2024, (collectively, the Settlement Agreements). As part of the Settlement Agreements, among other things, we agreed to pay civil penalties, complete recall requirements, undertake mitigation projects, provide extended warranties, undertake certain testing, take certain corporate compliance measures and make other payments. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreements subjects us to stipulated penalties. We recorded a charge of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 to resolve the matters addressed by the Settlement Agreements involving approximately one million of our pick-up truck applications in the U.S. This charge was in addition to the previously announced charges of $59 million for the recalls of model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks and model years 2016 through 2019 Titan trucks. We made $1.9 billion of payments required by the Settlement Agreements in the second quarter of 2024. Subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, we have recorded immaterial amounts related to stipulated penalties we determined to be probable and estimable. Any further non-compliance with the Settlement Agreements will likely subject us to further stipulated penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe have also been in communication with other non-U.S. regulators regarding matters related to the emission systems in our engines and may also become subject to additional regulatory review in connection with these matters.\nIn connection with our announcement of our entry into the agreement in principle, we became subject to shareholder, consumer and third-party litigation regarding the matters covered by the Settlement Agreements, and we may become subject to additional litigation in connection with these matters. See NOTE 14, \"COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nProduct Certification and Compliance \nOur products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements worldwide that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Over the past several years, we have increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. \nWe strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products while minimizing the impact on the environment, and we have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals. We remain committed to ensuring our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers.\nAnnounced in late 2019 and launched in early 2020, the Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs team leads both engine emissions certification and compliance and regulatory affairs initiatives and provides updates to the SET Committee of the Board at least annually. This organization is led by the Vice President - Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs and reports directly to the Chief Administrative Officer and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for product emissions matters. The focus of this organization is to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while complying with increasingly challenging global emission regulations. The organization also works to enhance our collaboration with the agencies setting the direction and regulations of emissions as we strive to meet every expectation today while planning for future changes.\nOther Environmental Statutes and Regulations \nExpenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. were not a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2025. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.\nIn the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we were identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 manufacturing and waste disposal sites. \nBased upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES \nAt December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 69,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 22,000 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2025 and 2029.\nThroughout our more than 100-year history, we have always recognized that people drive the strength of our business and our ability to effectively serve our customers and sustain our competitive position. We are focused on harmonizing our approach to talent to provide seamless opportunities and better experiences to our employees around the world. Our workforce strategy aims to cultivate an environment where all employees, regardless of employee type and location, know what is expected of them, are rewarded for their performance based on fair and equitable reviews, and have access to differentiated experiences, tools and leadership coaching to help them develop. This strategy is anchored on developing authentic and capable leaders, building effective organizations, driving employee engagement, furthering our company values of caring, integrity, excellence, teamwork and diversity and inclusion, delivering quality experiences and providing benefits that advance the well-being of our people and their families. \nLeadership and Talent Development\nDeveloping our human capital resources is a key focus for us. The Board remains resolute in overseeing this focus and providing guidance to our leadership team, through a committed Talent Management Compensation Committee. \nWe strive to create a leadership culture that begins with self-aware and capable leaders creating an environment in which all employees can thrive and reach their full potential. We encourage leaders to connect our people and their work to our mission, vision, values, brand promise and growth strategy, thus, motivating employees and hopefully helping them feel a higher sense of purpose in their contributions.\nWe have designed leadership and talent development programs for employees ranging from the manufacturing floor and technicians through to middle management and executives. We are promoting a learning culture by providing employees and their managers with tools and resources to have meaningful development conversations, envision and plan their careers, thrive in their work and navigate in a large global organization. Through our talent strategy, our goal is to provide all employees with equitable access to the development and career opportunities that a global company, like Cummins, enables. \nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nTo attract and retain the best employees, we focus on providing progressive, competitive pay and benefits. Our programs target the market for competitiveness and sustainability while ensuring that we honor our core values. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving the physical, mental, emotional, social and financial wellness of our employees throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, healthcare programs, paid time off, flexible work, retirement saving plans and employee stock purchase plans.\nWhen designing our base pay ranges, we conduct market analyses to ensure our ranges are competitive and our employees are advancing their earning potential. We also perform annual compensation studies to assess market movement, pay equity and living wages. We review wages globally as we continuously work to ensure we are fair, equitable, competitive and can attract and retain the best talent. \nWe also provide an array of benefits as part of our total rewards program that are aligned with our values and focused on supporting employees and their families based on their unique needs, some of which include the following: healthcare plans that are tiered by salary, to ensure affordability to all of our employees; paid parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers; travel benefits and advanced medical services to support complex health care needs; global employee assistance programs; and a global mental health program, all designed to support employees on the journey to well-being.\nEmployee Safety and Wellness \nCummins is committed to being world-class in health and safety. We are committed to removing conditions that cause personal injury or occupational illness, and we make decisions and promote behaviors that protect employees from risk of injury. We publicly disclose metrics on our rate of recordable injuries, our rate of lost workdays due to injury, rate of ergonomic injuries and rate of potentially serious injuries and fatalities. \nSince 2020, we have taken many steps in the employee safety and wellness area including the following:\n•Executed robust safety protocols for essential on-site personnel.\n•Implemented remote and hybrid work environments, where possible, to give employees flexibility to work off-site. As part of this effort, we provide remote ergonomic evaluations and support to help employees create off-site workspaces that are safe.\n•Provided high-quality clinical services at onsite and near-site medical clinics at several locations across the globe to support employee health and well-being.\n•Launched a global mental health campaign to destigmatize and normalize conversations about mental health, promote mental well-being, encourage employees and their families to seek help when needed and promote company-provided resources. This campaign has been extended to include physical, emotional, financial and social pillars of well-being. \nDiversity and Inclusion\nAt Cummins, our commitment to inclusion dates back more than a half-century and continues to be core to our fabric and continued success. We leverage the strength of our broadly diverse, global workforce to drive innovation and business results and deliver superior solutions for our customers and communities. We do this through our commitment to fostering an accountable culture that champions our vision of a workforce mirroring the communities we serve. This commitment starts at the top with our Board and permeates throughout our organization as everyone plays a role in nurturing inclusive environments where all employees can reach their full potential and thrive.\nOur strong focus on cultivating an inclusive culture underscores our belief that a diverse and inclusive workforce is a core value and competitive advantage for Cummins. This focus dates back to the early 1970s as reflected in a public statement made by our former Chairman, J. Irwin Miller:\n\"Character, ability and intelligence are not concentrated in one sex over the other, nor in persons with certain accents or in certain races or in persons holding degrees from universities over others. When we indulge ourselves in such irrational prejudices, we damage ourselves most of all and ultimately assure ourselves of failure in competition with those more open and less biased.\"\nOur long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion is consistent with our commitment to follow the law everywhere, including, without limitation, complying with U.S. and global laws and regulations related to civil rights and anti-discrimination. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects. \nFor more information on the topics above and our management of our human capital resources, please go to sustainability.cummins.com.

Our separate section above, \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,\" should be considered in addition to the following statements. \nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWhile we have reached Settlement Agreements with the EPA, CARB, the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Attorney General's Office to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S., we have incurred, and likely will incur, other additional claims, costs and expenses in connection with the matters covered by the Settlement Agreements and other matters related to our compliance with emission standards for our engines, including with respect to additional regulatory action and collateral litigation related to these matters. Those and related expenses and reputational damage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn December 2023, we announced that we reached the agreement in principle and recorded a charge of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S., which became final and effective in April 2024. This fourth quarter of 2023 charge was in addition to the previously announced charges of $59 million for the recalls of model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks and model years 2016 through 2019 Titan trucks. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreements subjects us to stipulated penalties. Subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, we recorded immaterial amounts related to stipulated penalties we determined to be probable and estimable. Any further non-compliance with the Settlement Agreements will likely subject us to further stipulated penalties and other adverse consequences. \nWe have also been in communication with other non-U.S. regulators regarding matters related to the emission systems in our engines and may also become subject to additional regulatory review in connection with these matters.\nIn connection with our announcement of our entry into the agreement in principle, we became subject to shareholder, consumer and third-party litigation regarding the matters covered by the Settlement Agreements, and we may become subject to additional litigation in connection with these matters. \nThe consequences resulting from the resolution of the foregoing matters are uncertain and the related expenses and reputational damage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See NOTE 14, \"COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nOur products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. In addition, failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreements will subject us to stipulated penalties. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDeveloping engines and components to meet more stringent and continuously changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.\nIn addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could \nresult in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEvolving environmental and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives may adversely impact our operations, could impact the competitive landscape within our markets and could negatively affect demand for our products. \nOur operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, carbon content, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. For example, in October 2023, the EPA published a final rule imposing reporting and recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers and importers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. We may become subject to additional evolving regulations related to the cleanup of contaminated property, such as the EPA's proposal to designate two widely used PFAS as hazardous substances.\nConcern over climate change has resulted in, and could continue to result in, new legal or regulatory requirements including those designed to reduce or mitigate carbon content or the effects of GHG emissions. We may become subject to further additional legislation, regulations or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with new rules could be difficult and costly, including increased capital expenditures. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legislation, regulation or accord could also impact our ability to compete in our markets and decrease demand for our products.\nWe operate our business on a global basis and changes in international, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies affecting and/or restricting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.\nWe manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in laws, regulations and government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationships including those with China, Brazil, E.U. and the U.K. More restrictive trade policies, such as efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, including, without limitation, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nEmbargoes, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, could limit the sales of our products. Embargoes, sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect our ability to collect receivables, access cash generated in China, provide aftermarket and warranty support for our products, sell products and otherwise impact our reputation and business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the adoption of new tax legislation, changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.\nOur global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to additional regulatory frameworks, including a complex system of commercial and trade regulations, around the world. In some cases, foreign regulatory frameworks are more stringent or complex than similar regimes in the United States. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries and expected global sustainability regulations, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. These new and emerging regulations are likely to require significant resources and data management systems and could increase our cost of doing business, restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies, and could result in fines and penalties or reputational harm if we do not fully comply.\nOur numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nFuture bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.\nIn an effort to limit GHG emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of certain diesel-powered vehicles by 2035. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our diesel business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.\nBUSINESS CONDITIONS / DISRUPTIONS\nWe are vulnerable to raw material, transportation and labor price fluctuations and supply shortages, which impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nWe continue to experience pockets of supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We single source a number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including, but not limited to, raw material availability, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes or unrest, shortages of labor, economic downturns, availability of credit, impaired financial condition, sanctions/tariffs, energy inflation/availability, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, acts of government or acts of war or terrorism). The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, the current economic environment has resulted, and may continue to result, in price volatility and increased levels of inflation of many of our raw material, transportation and other costs. In particular, increased levels of inflation, fluctuating interest rates and concerns regarding a potential economic recession may result in increased operating costs and/or decreased levels of profitability. Further, the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight, and our labor costs have increased as a result. Material, transportation, labor and other cost inflation has impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.\nOur markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels, including variability driven by supply chain inconsistency. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce, capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers. In periods of weak demand, we may face under-utilized capacity and un-recovered overhead costs, while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand, which could harm our business. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. \nFor 2024, we recognized $395 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $483 million in 2023. In 2024, more than forty percent of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. Although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur truck manufacturers and OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs, experiencing financial distress or experiencing a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nWe recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. Many are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers, financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers due to a change-in-control, could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\nOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. \nOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See NOTE 13, \"PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. \nOur businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks, there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. While the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, could result in declining margins.\nThe development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services.\nWe are investing in new products and technologies, including electrolyzers for hydrogen production and electrified power systems and related components and subsystems. Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products, which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers. The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.\nOur business is exposed to potential product liability claims.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.\nGENERAL\nWe may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent climate change regulations, accords, mitigation efforts, GHG regulations or other legislation designed to address climate change. \nThe scientific consensus indicates that emissions of GHG continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation. \nConcerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, accords and mitigation efforts. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions, and consumers are increasingly demanding products and services resulting in lower GHG emissions. We could face risks to our brand reputation, investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel, utility, transportation and compliance-related costs could increase our operating costs and negatively impact customer operations and demand for our products. As the impact of any additional future climate related legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nClimate change may exacerbate the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions, which may cause disruptions to our operations, including disrupting manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.\nOur plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions, divestitures or exiting the production of certain product lines or product categories may expose us to additional costs and risks. \nPart of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions, divestitures and/or exiting the production of certain product lines or product categories to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert management’s attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIf required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nSimilarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business or exit of a product line or product category may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in material costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.\nOur business and operations are subject to interest rate risks and changes in interest rates can reduce demand for our products and increase borrowing costs and result in non-cash charges\nRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and our customers’ ability to repay obligations to us. Rising interest rates may increase our cost of capital which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and cash flows. Rising interest rates could also impact certain goodwill assets requiring non-cash impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe operate in challenging markets for talent and may fail to attract, develop and retain key personnel. \nWe depend on the skills, institutional knowledge, working relationships, and continued services and contributions of key personnel, including our leadership team and others at all levels of the company, as a critical part of our human capital resources. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel in a highly competitive labor market, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nOur IT environment and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our IT environment and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new technologies, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important technology, including during upgrades and/or new implementations of technologies, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nThe data handled by our technologies is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. As such, our IT environment faces information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, ransomware attacks and other \"cyber attacks,\" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. Increasing use of artificial intelligence may increase these risks. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. As the result of changing market conditions, a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our IT environment. \nIn addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex technologies that control various processes and these technologies are potentially subject to \"cyber attacks\" and disruption. The impact of a significant IT event on either our IT environment or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business and in our products, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence solutions into our products, services and features, and we may leverage artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence and machine learning, in our product development, operations and software programming. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate artificial intelligence into their products or operational processes more quickly or more successfully than us, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation and results of operations.\nIn addition, there are significant risks involved in developing and deploying artificial intelligence and there can be no assurance that the usage of artificial intelligence will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, including the regulation of artificial intelligence by government or other regulatory agencies, will require significant resources to develop, test and maintain our platforms, offerings, services, and features to implement artificial intelligence ethically and minimize any unintended harmful impacts.\nWe are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base and product offerings and impact our growth globally. \nOur business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:\n•economic and political instability, including international conflicts, war, acts of terrorism or the threat thereof, political or labor unrest, civil unrest, riots, insurrections or trade wars;\n•potential changes to, uncertainty around or repeal of certain environmental laws and regulations, potentially slowing adoption of technologies we are investing in and developing;\n•the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n•the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;\n•the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\n•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;\n•public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as future pandemics or epidemics, quarantines or shutdowns related to public health crises, and other catastrophic events;\n•required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n•changes in general economic and political conditions, including changes in relationship with the U.S., in countries where we operate, particularly in China and emerging markets.\nAs we continue to operate and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.\nIn addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationships between the U.S. and China, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, especially trade with China could adversely impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition in the regions we serve.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, electrification and other technologies, and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. Additionally, we face increasing competition to develop innovative products that result in lower emissions. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.\nIncreasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. \nAs our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.\nFailure to meet sustainability expectations or standards, or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on sustainability matters, including GHG emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights and social responsibility. Given our commitment to certain sustainability principles, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments and targets which we may refine, or even expand further, in the future. These goals, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include:\n•reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments or other stakeholders;\n•adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;\n•the success of our collaborations with third parties;\n•increased risk of litigation, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions;\n•unfavorable sustainability ratings or investor sentiment;\n•diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess and report on sustainability metrics;\n•our ability to achieve our goals, commitments and targets within the timeframes announced;\n•access to and increased cost of capital and\n•adverse impacts on our stock price.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our sustainability goals, commitments and targets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.\nAt December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 69,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 22,000 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2025 and 2029. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us, our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. \nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.\nSignificant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.\nSignificant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.\nWe are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.\nThe level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.",
