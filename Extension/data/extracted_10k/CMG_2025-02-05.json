      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“Chipotle,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants, which feature a relevant menu of burritos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla), quesadillas, tacos, and salads. We strive to cultivate a better world by serving responsibly sourced, classically cooked, real food with wholesome ingredients and without artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. We are passionate about providing a great guest experience and making our food more accessible to everyone while continuing to be a brand with a demonstrated purpose. Our first Chipotle restaurant opened in Denver, Colorado in 1993. Over 30 years later, our devotion to seeking out high-quality ingredients, raised with respect for animals, farmers, and the environment, remains at the core of our commitment to Food with Integrity.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 3,644 Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and 82 international Chipotle restaurants. Additionally, we had three international licensed restaurants. We manage our U.S. operations based on ten regions and aggregate our operations to one reportable segment. Our revenue is derived from sales by our restaurants.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe are a brand with a demonstrated purpose of Cultivating a Better World. Our mission is to win today while we grow our future by focusing on five key fundamental strategies:\n•Running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences;\n•Amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; \n•Making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement;\n•Sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level; and\n•Expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. \nFood with Integrity\nServing high-quality food at reasonable prices is critical to ensuring guests enjoy wholesome food at a great value. In Chipotle-owned and operated restaurants, we strive to serve only animal products that are raised in accordance with criteria we have established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare, and without the use of non-therapeutic antibiotics or added growth hormones. We brand our meats as “Responsibly Raised®.” We also seek to use responsibly grown produce, by which we mean produce grown by suppliers whose practices conform to our Food with Integrity standards and our priorities with respect to environmental considerations and employee welfare. For more information about our sustainability and animal welfare initiatives, see our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/sustainability.\nPurchasing\nMaintaining the high levels of quality and safety we demand in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality, fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We work with 26 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers that purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on the suppliers' understanding of and adherence to our mission and Food with Integrity standards, quality and price availability. We have also sought to increase the number of suppliers for our ingredients to help mitigate pricing volatility and reduce our reliance on one or several suppliers, which could create supply shortages. In addition, we closely monitor industry news, trade tariffs, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, geopolitical crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices or available supply. Certain key ingredients are purchased from a small number of suppliers.\nQuality Assurance and Food Safety\nWe are committed to serving only safe, high-quality food. Our food safety and quality assurance teams work to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices, components of which include:\n•naturally derived inhibitors to prevent microbial growth in ingredients;\n•advanced technologies and tools that reduce or eliminate pathogens while maintaining food quality;\n•enhanced restaurant procedures and protocols for handling ingredients and sanitizing surfaces in our restaurants;\n•food safety certifications;\n•internal and third-party restaurant inspections;\n•small grower support during on-site audits;\n•supplier interventions steps to mitigate food safety risks before ingredients reach Chipotle; and\n•ingredient traceability.\nThese and other food safety practices underscore our commitment to be a leader in food safety while continuing to serve high-quality food that our guests love. Our food safety and quality assurance teams establish and monitor our quality and food safety programs and work closely with suppliers to ensure our high standards are met throughout the supply chain. We maintain a limited list of approved suppliers, many of whom are among the top suppliers in the industry. In addition, we have a team approach where our training, operations, culinary, legal and restaurant food safety and quality assurance departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, food preparation, restaurant cleanliness, employee health protocols, and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also intended to ensure we not only continue to comply with applicable food safety regulations, but also establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. To help achieve this goal, we have a Food Safety Advisory Council comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities. The Food Safety Advisory Council is charged with evaluating our programs and advising us on ways to maintain and elevate our food safety program. Our food safety and quality assurance team members hold board seats and participate in technical working groups with several associations. This gives us the opportunity to learn and share our knowledge and expertise with other food safety professionals and regulatory agencies.\nDigital Business and Innovation\nOur digital platform continues to be a strategic driver of our growth. Digital sales represent food and beverage revenue for company-owned restaurants generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators and include revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards. Digital sales represented 35.1% of food and beverage revenue in 2024, compared to 37.4% in 2023. We have made digital ordering convenient with continued enhancements to our app and by building more Chipotlanes, which is our drive through format for guest pick-up of digital orders. We are also investing in technology and tools to modernize the back of house of our restaurants and to improve the team member experience.\nHuman Capital\nAt Chipotle, our vision is to cultivate an environment where our employees can thrive and grow into great leaders. We believe in investing and supporting our people because they are our most important asset. As of December 31, 2024, Chipotle employed 130,504 people worldwide and 1,328 contract workers. Of our employees, 127,820 worked in the United States, and 2,684 worked internationally across Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Within the U.S., 126,233 employees worked in our restaurants, and 1,587 in our Restaurant Support Centers and Field Leadership. There were no union petitions or campaigns in 2024, and we continue to bargain in good faith with the one restaurant that voted in 2022 to form a union. We also continue to focus on building a positive people culture where employees feel supported, heard, and are able to grow with Chipotle. \nTalent Acquisition\nWe remain committed to the growth, development, and advancement of our people. In 2024, over 85% of our in-restaurant leadership roles were filled through internal promotions, which remains a critical component to our staffing strategy. To continually attract and hire external talent, we remain focused on creating a best-in-class job seeker and General Manager hiring experience that prioritizes speed, but that also aims to create a transparent process; an experience that identifies shift-specific needs and elevates our talent bar for quality-of-hire. We have seen early success with our new virtual hiring assistant \"Ava Cado\", almost doubling our application flow. With Ava Cado, approximately 90% of applications are completed, and restaurants are leveraging automated interview rescheduling, freeing up managers to run great restaurants and serve our guests. \nTo expand our recruitment marketing efforts we continue developing both new and existing partnerships, such as Transition Overwatch and Recruit Military, which assist transitioning Veterans and their spouses. We also prioritize understanding the hiring needs of our international operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. \n![alt  9421](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058090/000105809025000014/cmg-20241231_g1.jpg)\nCulture and Inclusivity (\"C&I\")\nOur purpose extends beyond serving nutritious food using real ingredients. We are on a journey to create a global culture where everyone is welcome and feels a genuine sense of belonging, and we believe this is achieved through our daily interactions and commitment to model inclusive leadership.\nIn 2024, Chipotle continued to invest in employee development and training. Our learning programs include inclusive topics and skill-building to provide our leaders with the resources they need to succeed in their current roles and prepare for the future. Our training programs will continue to evolve to respond to a constantly changing world.\nDevotion to our culture of inclusivity emanates from our values and the belief that our people make us what we are. We do not see inclusion as a moment, but a movement towards a future where all people can experience success as their best authentic selves. That is why our efforts are not confined to certain roles, departments, identities, or geographies. Driven by a strategy spanning across culture, community, candidate, career, and commerce, we are making meaningful strides towards a future where diversity is understood, embraced, and is a source of our strength. \nMaintaining a work environment where all people can succeed as their full authentic self is critical to our success as a business. To deliver meaningful programs that meet the needs of our employees, it is important we understand the dynamic composition of our workforce. As of December 31, 2024, 48.9% of our workforce was male and 49.8% of our workforce was female.\n\nOur most recent Equal Employment Opportunity consolidated report is posted on the Investors page of our website at www.ir.chipotle.com under Corporate Governance – Human Capital Information and additional details about the demographics of our employee population is included in our biennial Sustainability Report and interim Update Report on our website www.chipotle.com/sustainability.\nWe have undertaken a range of activity to promote a culture of inclusion:\n•We continue to drive a consistent and structured candidate interview process with interview guides. This ensures top candidates are identified through equitable hiring practices in both internal and external candidate interviews. We also launched an internal job board across multiple communication channels to provide increased visibility and access to internal opportunities.\n•In 2024, Chipotle hired a Director of C&I to create and execute a strategy for inclusion, advise across Centers of Excellence, and enhance existing programs with C&I training. This specialized role is also responsible for the continued maturation of our Employee Resource Groups through a new strategy that improves the leader and member experience. \n•We have a holistic approach to pay equity to ensure consistent and equitable compensation among our employees. We retain an independent third-party compensation consultant each year to conduct a pay equity analysis of our U.S. and Canadian workforce, including factors of pay (e.g., grade level, tenure in role, most recent promotion) and external market conditions (e.g., geographic location), to ensure equitable treatment among our employees. In 2024, our review included 99% of our U.S. and Canadian employee population, excluding only approximately 50 of our most senior management employees. The analysis identified small, isolated pay gaps for certain segments of the population, and we subsequently made pay adjustments to close those gaps. Since there are not many common roles among our 50 most senior executives, we consider both internal equity by level, as well as individualized market data, to help ensure we maintain pay equity among this group.\nTalent Management\nWe are committed to cultivating a high-performing workforce through a talent development strategy that prioritizes attracting, developing, and retaining exceptional talent at every level of the organization. In 2024, we promoted over 23,000 employees. Importantly, amongst our Field Leadership roles (Field Leaders, Team Directors, Regional Directors of Operations, and Regional Vice Presidents), the internal promotion rate was above 80%.\nOur robust hiring, onboarding, and training programs ensure our newly hired and recently promoted employees are set up for success and are aligned with Chipotle's values and goals. We deployed a variety of critical programming ensuring leadership development where most needed. Some notable highlights include:\n•Cultivate University is our leadership training program for new Field Leaders and Team Directors navigating multi-unit management for the first time. Leaders are brought together for a four-day immersive leadership experience designed to bolster leadership skills, while validating and grounding attendees in the operational skills necessary to succeed. In 2024, we had 129 leaders complete the program.\n•We introduced additional required restaurant leader training at all levels in 2024, building skills around accountability, coaching, feedback, delegation, and resolving conflict. The courses are designed to align with the leadership skills necessary to excel at each level of restaurant management. \n•We formalized our Field Leader in Training materials and have seen cohorts launch throughout the business, ensuring that Managers interested in promotion are getting the development they need to take on the next role. \n•Leadership Evolution and Development, our leadership development program, is designed to prepare a cross-functional cohort of mid-level managers for the future of work and leadership. During the 6-month program, participants focus on the capabilities of leading oneself, others, and the business with topics designed to stretch capabilities and improve decision-making skills.\nIn addition, to ensure leadership continuity, we maintain a robust succession planning process, focusing on critical roles across the company. In 2024, we identified successors for 72% of key positions and continued to develop individualized development plans tailored to prepare successors for readiness. Due to Chipotle's growth, we are excited about two newly created regions and three promotions into Regional Director of Operations and Regional Vice President roles, highlighting additional growth and development for our field teams. \nTotal Rewards\nThe financial, physical, and mental well being of our employees remains our top priority. We believe we have compelling compensation packages and incentive programs, and a robust suite of benefit offerings that enable us to engage current team members and attract new team members. In 2024, we conducted an Employee Value Proposition survey which was intended to help us understand what employees appreciate in Chipotle as an employer, what needs improvement and what drives value for our employees. We have gathered valuable insights that will help us continue to improve the employee experience and attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Other areas of Total Rewards that help support our employees include: \n•We have made substantial investments in our compensation packages, including competitive wages and industry leading incentive programs, such as our annual and quarterly bonus programs.\n•We offer a Debt-Free Degree program that provides Chipotle employees' access to nearly 100 degrees at 10 universities, completely tuition free.\n•We support Career Certificates, which further enhances our Tuition Assistance benefits by providing on-demand certificate programs to help Chipotle team members advance their careers in as little as eight weeks.\n•We offer a student loan payment matching programs via our 401(k) retirement program. This, in addition to a credit optimization service, has helped to bolster our employees' financial well-being.\n•We also offer personalized mental health assistance to all Chipotle employees and their family members with support available 24/7 via in-person, phone, or virtual visits with a licensed counselor.\n•Starting in 2025, we are expanding our mental health benefits by offering free access to a mental health app to all U.S. employees. \nEmployee Listening\nWe value feedback; both positive sentiments and constructive comments help us improve our organization and culture. Many of our best ideas come from Chipotle employees and we use various communication channels to maintain awareness and responsiveness to questions, concerns, and ideas across our workforce. This includes direct daily engagement through meetings with General Managers, lunch and learns, and other one-on-one interactions. \nEmployees are encouraged to ask questions, voice concerns directly or anonymously report potential violations of Chipotle's Code of Ethics through our Respectful Workplace hotline. Employees also can raise concerns using other mechanisms, including communication with their managers or human resources business partners. We actively encourage our employees to report any issues or concerns without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. \nWe also respond to employee issues quickly via our Employee Service Center which is available seven days a week to resolve employee questions about things like restaurant health and safety, compliance, benefits, payroll, etc. \nWe are eager to improve our employee engagement efforts and build even stronger feedback mechanisms to ensure our employees feel valued, heard and respected. \nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern aspects of our business operations. While costs associated with compliance with laws and regulations have increased as the number and scope of regulations have increased, the total costs incurred have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nSeasonality\nSeasonal factors influencing our business are described under the heading “Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nCompetition \nThe fast-casual, quick-service, and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, brand reputation, and cleanliness and ambience of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments, including locally-owned restaurants, as well as national and regional chains. Competition from food delivery services, which offer meals from a wide variety of restaurants, also has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase. Many of our competitors also offer dine-in, carry-out, online, catering, and delivery services. Among our main competitors are restaurant formats that claim to serve higher quality ingredients without artificial flavors, colors and preservatives, and that serve food quickly and at a reasonable price. \nOur Intellectual Property and Trademarks \n“Chipotle,” “Chipotle Mexican Grill,” “Food with Integrity,” “Responsibly Raised,” “Chipotle Rewards,” and a number of other marks and related designs and logos are U.S. registered trademarks of Chipotle. We have filed trademark applications for a number of additional marks in the U.S. as well. In addition to our U.S. registrations, we have registered trademarks for “Chipotle” and a number of other marks in Canada, the European Union, the Middle East and various other countries, and have filed trademark applications for “Chipotle Mexican Grill,” “Chipotle” and a number of other marks in additional countries. We also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress and have registered elements of our restaurant design for trade dress protection in the U.S. as well.\nFrom time to time, we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks, restaurant designs or advertising. Although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business. \nAvailable Information \nWe maintain a website at www.chipotle.com, including an investor relations section at ir.chipotle.com, on which we routinely post important information, such as webcasts of quarterly earnings calls and other investor events in which we participate or host, and any related materials. Our Code of Ethics and our Supplier Code of Conduct also are available in this section of our website.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described below occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including, but not limited to, overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may arise or become material and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Brand Reputation and Restaurant Operations\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by negatively impacting our brand, decreasing sales and increasing costs.\nFood safety is our top priority, and we dedicate significant resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, high-quality food products. However, even with strong preventative controls and interventions from farm to restaurant, food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated. Incidents of food-borne illnesses continue to occur in the restaurant and retail food industries and incidents may result from the failure of restaurant employees to properly cook or maintain our ingredients, employees or guests entering our restaurant while infected with communicable diseases, or contaminated ingredients resulting from the failure of one of our suppliers to execute food safety preventive controls. Although we monitor and audit compliance with our program, we cannot guarantee that every food item is safely and properly maintained from the start of the supply chain through guest consumption. Any report, legitimate or rumored, of food-borne illness caused by pathogens such as E. coli, hepatitis A, norovirus, listeria, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens or salmonella, or other food safety issues, such as food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect our reputation and have a negative impact on our sales. In addition, instances of food-borne illness or food safety issues that occur solely at competitors’ restaurants, suppliers or distributors (even if we do not work with them) could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nWe may be at a higher risk for food safety incidents than some competitors due to our greater use of fresh, unprocessed produce, handling of raw chicken in our restaurants, our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods and the lack of artificial preservatives and frozen ingredients in our menu items. The risk of illnesses associated with our food also may increase due to our delivery or catering businesses, in which our food is transported, stored and/or served in conditions that are not under our control. All of these factors could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain guests, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability. In addition, real or perceived concerns about emerging food safety issues, such as phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS\"), microplastics or heavy metals in the U.S. food supply chain, could impact consumers’ confidence in the restaurant industry and reduce restaurant sales.\nFailure to maintain the reputation and relevance of the Chipotle brand could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe built strong value in the Chipotle brand by serving delicious, high quality food, made fresh every day using responsibly sourced ingredients served in generous portions. Our continued success depends on maintaining this compelling brand value, which may be eroded by numerous factors, some of which are outside of our control. Incidents that could erode trust in our brand include actual or perceived food safety or food-borne illnesses; allegations of unethical, racially-biased, inequitable, or socially irresponsible behavior by employees and/or guests; privacy breaches or violations of privacy laws; safety-related incidents occurring in or around our restaurants; guest perceptions regarding smaller entrée portion sizes; or other events or incidents described in this risk factors section. The adverse impact of such incidents may be compounded by negative publicity, including through social or digital media, or if they result in litigation. Social media, video-sharing, networking, and gaming and messaging platforms dramatically increase the speed with which negative publicity is disseminated, often before we have a meaningful opportunity to investigate, respond to and address an issue. Negative online postings or comments about us, including as a result of inaccurate, fictitious or malicious postings or media content, have in the past and could in the future magnify and prolong the adverse impact of any one incident and increase the damage to the value of our brand. \nAdditionally, consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we, our employees or business partners fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions, fail to deliver a consistently positive guest experience or fail to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment. In addition, we cannot ensure that our restaurant crew or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect our brand reputation and relevance.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to taste preferences, price, food quality and selection, customer service, brand reputation, digital engagement, advertising and promotional initiatives, and the location, attractiveness and maintenance of restaurants. We also compete with non-traditional market participants, such as “convenience meals” in the form of entrées, side dishes or meal preparation kits from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services, and “ghost” or “dark” kitchens, where meals are prepared at separate takeaway premises rather than a restaurant, and with delivery aggregators and food delivery services, which provide consumers with convenient access to a broad range of competing restaurant chains and food retailers, particularly in urbanized areas, and may form a closer relationship with our guests. Increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability and development plans. If guest tastes or dietary preferences change, if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful, or if our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other restaurant outlets, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe continue to believe our commitment to higher-quality and responsibly sourced ingredients resonates with guests and gives us a competitive advantage; however, many of our competitors also make claims related to the quality of their ingredients and lack of artificial flavors, colors and preservatives. The increasing use of these claims by competitors, regardless of the accuracy of such claims, may lessen our differentiation and make it more difficult for us to compete. If we are unable to continue to maintain our distinctiveness and compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur investments in technology and automation to transform and enhance the experience of our employees and guests may not generate the expected results.\nWe have launched several initiatives to make our food preparation and cooking processes more efficient and drive a better experience for our employees and consumers, most of which are still moving through our “stage gate” development and evaluation process. These initiatives include a dual sided plancha, which is our cooking grill; an automated produce slicer; an automated make line by Hyphen, which would automatically assemble guest ordered bowls and salads; and Autocado, an automated avocado processing device that cuts, cores and scoops avocados. We have invested significant time and resources into developing and testing these technologies, but there can be no guarantee that all or any of them will be widely deployed throughout our restaurant network or, if deployed, will materially improve employee or guest experience or our financial performance. We also continue to build upon our investments in digital ordering and guest engagement to enhance guest experience and strengthen our ties with our guests. If these initiatives are not ultimately deployed or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\nOur use of third-party delivery services may not be profitable and substandard service may negatively impact our reputation.\nOver 15% of our 2024 food and beverage revenue consisted of delivery orders for which we are reliant on third-party delivery companies. Depending on which ordering platform a guest uses – our platform or the third-party delivery service platform – the delivery fee we collect from the guest may be less than the actual delivery cost. As the delivery industry consolidates, delivery companies gain greater leverage in negotiating the terms of contracts and increasing pricing, which in turn could negatively impact our profits from this channel. If the third-party delivery companies we utilize increase the fees they charge users or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to other restaurants, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. In addition, if a third-party delivery driver fails to deliver an order on time, fails to deliver the complete order or otherwise provides a bad guest experience, our guest may attribute that negative experience to Chipotle and our reputation and sales could be adversely impacted. The ordering and payment platforms used by these third parties, our mobile app or our online ordering site have been and could again be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our overall sales and reputation. \nRisks Related to Human Capital\nIf we are not able to hire, develop and retain qualified restaurant employees and/or appropriately plan our workforce, our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe aggressive pace at which we open new restaurants can make it increasingly difficult to recruit and hire sufficient numbers of qualified employees to manage and work in our restaurants, to train employees to deliver a consistently high-quality product and guest experience and to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a dispersed workforce, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Maintaining appropriate staffing in our restaurants requires precise workforce planning, which has become more complex due to predictive scheduling laws (also called “fair workweek” or “secure scheduling”) and “just cause” termination legislation in certain geographic areas where we operate. The market for qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must continue to offer competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees. We have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining restaurant employees and in maintaining full restaurant staffing in various locations, which has resulted in longer wait times for guest orders, temporary closures of the digital make line and decreased employee and guest satisfaction. A shortage of qualified candidates who meet legal work authorization requirements, failure to hire, train and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels could affect our ability to open new restaurants, grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives. Anticipated changes in immigration laws and regulations could decrease the pool of candidates with legal work authorization, cause disruption in the workforce for all companies that rely on hourly workers and increase the costs, time and requirements to hire new employees. In addition, failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization efforts, which could negatively impact our financial results. We have experienced labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and disrupt our normal operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable employment and labor laws and regulations, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nVarious employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees, both within and outside the U.S. These laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide and document meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, requirements relating to setting and changing work schedules, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules, healthcare laws, anti-discrimination laws, including pay transparency requirements, and anti-harassment laws. We incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. For example, we have had lawsuits filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime, meal and rest breaks, pay transparency to applicants and related practices. We incur legal costs to defend these types of cases, and we could incur losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such costs and losses could be material.\nIn addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented fair workweek or “secure scheduling” legislation, which impose complex requirements related to scheduling for certain restaurant employees; sick pay and paid time off legislation, which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees; and/or “just cause” termination legislation, which restricts companies’ ability to terminate employees or reduce employees’ hours unless they can prove “just cause” or a “bona fide economic reason” for the termination or reduction in hours. Additional jurisdictions are considering similar types of legislation. All of these regulations impose additional obligations on us, which could increase our operating costs, and our failure to comply with any of these regulations could subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees and our results of operations, and potentially cause us to close or reduce operating hours of some restaurants in these jurisdictions. For example, in 2022 we settled a complaint alleging that we violated New York City’s Fair Workweek law and Earned Safe and Sick Time Act, and we have undergone several audits of our compliance with employment law requirements, which could result in additional liabilities. Our liability exposure for these employment laws and regulations may be higher than our restaurant peers because we have more employees, since we are one of the largest restaurant companies that owns and operates all our restaurants, while most of our restaurant peers franchise some or a significant portion of their operations.\nIncreases in the cost of labor, including mandated minimum wage increases and increases in the cost of health benefits, could adversely impact our business and profitability.\nOur profitability has been and could continue to be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and health benefits, which are some of our most significant costs, including increases triggered by federal, state and local laws governing matters such as minimum wages, meal and rest breaks and changes to eligibility for overtime pay; regulations regarding scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; and higher wages and benefit costs necessary to attract, hire and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets in a highly competitive job market. In addition, state and local laws may require wage increases and standards on working hours and other factors that would restrict our flexibility to respond to market conditions and increase our costs without corresponding benefits. For example, in 2024 California required national restaurant chains, including Chipotle, to pay a minimum $20 per hour wage to California restaurant workers, which minimum wage may be increased annually by a state-appointed council. Other states, counties and cities are considering similar regulations. Our ability to offset higher labor costs by increasing menu prices depends on the willingness of our guests to pay the higher prices and the perceived value of our meals relative to competitors. If competitive or inflationary pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting higher labor costs by increased menu prices, our profitability may decline.\nA failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of management personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic growth plans and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.\nOur ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel. Changes in senior management could result in significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capability to support our strategic initiatives, a failure to implement appropriate development programs and build adequate bench strength with key skillsets, or a failure to effectively manage our leadership succession, could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and incentivize sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and IT Systems\nBreaches or other unauthorized access, theft, modification or destruction of guest and/or employee personal, confidential or other material information that is stored in our systems or by third parties on our behalf could damage our reputation and expose us to potential liabilities.\nAs our reliance on technology has grown, the scope and severity of potential risks from cyber threats has increased. Many of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our guests, business partners and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain confidential information about our business, such as business strategies, development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as suppliers. Similar to many other restaurant companies, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future.\nOur third-party providers’ and business partners’ information technology systems and databases are subject to similar risks. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year and increases as the scope and scale of our technology footprint and digital operations increases. In addition, we provide guest and employee data, as well as confidential information important to our business to third parties. Individuals performing work for us and these third parties also may access some of this data, including on personally owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of guests’ or employees’ data or confidential information of Chipotle stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain guests or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing, deepfakes, ransomware, malware or social engineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches.\nGiven the increasing complexity and sophistication of techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access to or disable information technology systems, and the fact that cyberattacks are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, it is increasingly difficult to anticipate and defend against cyberattacks, and a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Moreover, the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be finalized and completed and reliable information about the incident is known. During the pendency of any such investigation, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and we may be required to disclose incidents before their full extent is known.\nSuch security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger data breach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private third party or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. These risks also exist in companies that license our brand, that we partner with or invest in that use separate information systems. \nWe may be required to make significant capital investments and other expenditures to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies and training, hiring additional employees, retention of experts and providing credit monitoring services for individuals whose data has been breached. These costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by causing us to delay the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nMedia or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and employees to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nIf we fail to fully comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations, we could incur significant civil and criminal penalties and liabilities, suffer reputational damage, and adverse publicity.\nComplex local, state, federal and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new services. \n\nFor example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide specified disclosures to California consumers and allows them to exercise certain rights in connection with their personal information, such as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions). The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in January 2023, significantly modified the CCPA to include additional compliance obligations. Since the CCPA was first passed, 19 other states have enacted similar data privacy legislation, eight of which are in effect as of the end of 2024. In addition, a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws, including laws on health data and biometric data that are in effect, or are expected to take effect in the near future. These state privacy laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply. \nIf we fail or are perceived to have failed to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, or fail to properly respond to or honor consumer requests under any of the foregoing privacy laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations, or claims for damages by guests and other affected individuals or parties, or incur fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems and failures or interruptions in our IT systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and/or result in the loss of guests or employees.\nWe are heavily dependent on information technology systems, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale and payment processing in our restaurants, digital ordering and delivery business, tracing ingredients back to suppliers and growers, digital Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points monitoring, monitoring and managing our supply chain, our guest rewards program, marketing initiatives, employee engagement and payroll processing, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the procurement, production, distribution, safety and sale of our products depends significantly on the consistent availability, reliability and security of these systems. Many of these critical systems are provided and managed by third parties, and we are reliant on these third-party providers to implement protective measures that ensure the security and availability of their systems. Although we have operational safeguards in place and we take efforts to ensure that our third-party providers have implemented proper standards and controls, we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these third-party systems or platforms will not occur. Failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or the third-party service providers. If any of our critical IT systems were to become unreliable, unavailable, compromised or otherwise fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our operations that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nIncreases in the costs of ingredients, restaurant equipment and other materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe prices for some of our ingredients, such as beef, avocados and other produce fluctuate due to factors beyond our control, such as limited sources, seasonal shifts, climate conditions, inclement weather, natural disasters, inflation, military and geopolitical conflicts and industry demand, including as a result of animal disease outbreaks, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation. In addition, we source some ingredients (including avocados, tomatoes, beef, pork, limes and peppers) restaurant equipment, packaging and paper products outside the U.S. (including from Mexico, Canada and China), which could subject them to increased tariffs, trade sanctions or taxes. We try to mitigate future price risk through forward contracts, strong partnerships with key suppliers, directly managing key raw material procurement and diversifying our supply base and countries of origin; however, these activities may not fully insulate us from increases in costs, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe also could be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our Responsibly Raised animal welfare criteria, and ingredients grown in accordance with our Food with Integrity specifications, the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for conventionally raised or grown ingredients. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as chicken, beef, dairy (for cheese, sour cream and queso), avocados, tomatoes and pork, would have a particularly adverse effect on our operating results. If the cost of one or more ingredients significantly increases, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items that use those ingredients, such as guacamole or one of our proteins, rather than pay the increased cost. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and could adversely impact our sales and brand.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of ingredients that comply with our Food with Integrity specifications, such as dairy (for cheese, sour cream and queso) and chicken that meets our Responsibly Raised requirements. We may experience shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to higher or more lucrative demand from other sources; inclement weather or natural disasters; animal disease outbreaks (such as avian flu); social or labor unrest; shortages of agricultural workers (including due to changes in immigration laws); operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers (including due to cyberattacks, malware or ransomware); financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors, or the inability of suppliers or distributors to manage adverse business conditions; or other conditions beyond our control. Ongoing global conflicts have disrupted and could continue to disrupt some shipping routes, which could result in shortages or delays of certain ingredients and packaging. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including lemon and lime juice, tomatoes and adobo. Although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of ingredients, shortages or interruptions in our supply of ingredients could adversely affect our financial results.\nIf our supply chain capacity does not expand to match our new restaurant growth, our long-term growth goals could be impaired or delayed.\nWe have set aggressive goals for the number of new restaurants we plan to open over the next few years. Even in the absence of extraordinary disruptions, we may not be able to increase the capacity of our supply chain to keep pace with our growth and fully meet our future business needs. We have experienced and may in the future experience limited available supplies of Responsibly Raised proteins and ingredients that meet our Food with Integrity specifications. In addition, we rely on independent third-party distributors to maintain an inventory of our ingredients and supplies, and deliver them to our restaurants on a timely, as needed basis. There can be no assurance that our suppliers or distributors will be able to accommodate our planned growth or continue to supply required ingredients at preferential prices or at all. An inability of our suppliers to accommodate our growth in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could be party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including claims brought by employees, guests, government agencies, suppliers, distributors, shareholders, job applicants or others. These proceedings may be in the form of private actions, administrative proceedings, government enforcement or regulatory actions and litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential claimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including those governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food safety issues including food-borne illness, food contamination and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches; discrimination against guests or job applicants; personal injury in our restaurants; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our Food with Integrity, marketing or sustainability claims are misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers’ compensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment laws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant and the proceedings may divert management's attention away from operating our business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third-party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, adverse publicity resulting from claims may damage our reputation. \nWe are subject to extensive laws, government regulation, and other legal requirements and our failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our operational efficiencies, ability to attract and retain talent and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including those relating to: \n•preparation, sale and labeling of food, including regulations of the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the safety of the entire food system and covers inspections and mandatory food recalls, menu labeling and nutritional content;\n•employment practices and working conditions, including minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, meal and rest breaks, fair workweek/secure scheduling and “just cause” legislation, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, classification of employees, paid and family leave, workplace safety, immigration and overtime among others;\n•privacy and data security (including regulations governing the protection of personal information, advertising and marketing, access by children, biometrics, surveillance, artificial intelligence, health-related information and financial information), such as California Privacy Rights Act and CCPA in California and privacy-related legislation in a growing number of other states, and international laws such as GDPR in the European Union and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada;\n•health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages;\n•building and zoning requirements, including state and local licensing and regulation governing the design and operation of facilities and land use;\n•claims made in marketing and advertising, including regarding nutritional information and sustainability impacts;\n•public accommodations and safety conditions, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations, online resources and other areas;\n•environmental matters, such as emissions and air quality; water consumption; the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances; local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants; and claims we make about our sustainability practices and achievements; \n•new or increased tariffs, trade sanctions or taxes; and\n•public company compliance, disclosure and governance matters, including accounting and tax regulations, SEC and NYSE disclosure requirements.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations, and future new laws or changes in these laws or regulations that impose additional requirements, can be costly. If the Food and Drug Administration or other government agency adopts new laws and regulations in response to real or perceived emerging food safety, such as concerns over phthalates, PFAS, microplastics or heavy metals in the U.S. food supply, it could impose new processes that disrupt our suppliers’ operations, increase costs or both. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability.\nRisks Related to Our Growth and Business Strategy\nIf we are unable to meet our new restaurant opening goals, or maintain the attractiveness of our existing restaurants, our profitability could suffer.\nOur growth depends on our ability to open new restaurants at an aggressive rate and operate them profitably as soon as possible. The cost of opening new restaurants has continued to increase due to construction labor inflation and increased costs of materials and equipment. In addition, we incur substantial startup expenses each time we open a new restaurant, and it can take up to 36 months to ramp up the sales and profitability of a new restaurant, during which time costs may be higher as we train new employees and build up a guest base. If we are unable to build the guest base that we expect or fail to overcome the higher startup expenses associated with new restaurants, our new restaurants may not be as profitable as our existing restaurants. In addition, the opening of new stores may negatively impact the profitability of existing stores that are located nearby. \nOur ability to open and profitably operate new restaurants also is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of desirable locations; the negotiation of acceptable lease terms; the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) and comply with other regulatory requirements; the availability of capable contractors and subcontractors; increases in the cost and decreases in the availability of labor and building material; changes in weather, natural disasters, pandemics or other acts of God that could delay construction and adversely affect guest traffic; our ability to hire and train qualified management and restaurant employees; and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods. Our timeline for completing construction also has gotten longer, due to landlord reluctance to commit to building in light of fluctuating interest rates, tight money supply and general economic conditions, and due to backlogs and long wait times for us to obtain required permits and utility hookups.\nIn addition, we need to maintain the attractiveness of our existing restaurants through remodels, upgrades and regular upkeep. If the costs associated with remodels, upgrades or regular upkeep are higher than anticipated, restaurants are closed for remodeling for longer periods than planned or remodeled restaurants do not perform as expected, which could have a negative effect on our operating results, and we may not realize our projected desired return on investment.\nOur failure to effectively manage and support our growth could have a negative adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned and operated over 3,700 Chipotle restaurants and we plan to open a significant number of new restaurants in the next several years, working towards our long-term goal of 7,000 restaurants in North America. Our existing restaurant management systems, back-office technology systems and processes, financial and management controls, information systems and staffing may not be adequate to support our growing business. To effectively manage a larger number of restaurants, we may need to upgrade and expand our infrastructure and information systems, automate more processes that currently are manual or require manual intervention and hire, train and retrain restaurant employees and corporate support staff, all of which may result in increased costs and at least temporary inefficiencies. We also believe our culture is an important contributor to our success, and as we continue to grow it may be increasingly difficult to imbed and maintain our culture across the company. Our failure to sufficiently invest in our infrastructure and information systems and maintain our strong staffing and culture could harm our brand and operating results.\nIf we partner with third parties or acquire new businesses that do not align with our core values or that do not fulfill their contractual responsibilities and commitments, our brand reputation and international growth plans could suffer.\nOur global growth strategy includes expanding our existing restaurant footprint and introducing Chipotle in new international jurisdictions in which we currently do not operate. The success of our strategy will depend on our identifying and partnering with new business partners, including licensees, joint venture partners, suppliers and distributors, and may include identifying suitable acquisition targets in these new jurisdictions that align with our core values. In 2024, the first licensed Chipotle restaurants opened in Kuwait and Dubai in partnership with international franchise retail operator Alshaya Group, and there are plans to open more licensed restaurants in other areas in the Middle East. We believe guests expect the same high quality food and excellent customer service at restaurants operated by licensees and joint venture partners as they receive in Chipotle-owned and operated restaurants. We provide extensive training to our business partners and we require compliance with specific food quality and safety standards and guest service levels in our agreements with business partners; however, we do not have direct control over the restaurants operated by third-party partners, and the quality and service in those restaurants may be less than the quality and service of Chipotle-operated restaurants. Failure of our business partners to adhere to our high food quality and operating standards, comply with applicable law, adhere to high ethical standards, and create a culture of respect in their restaurants could damage our brand reputation, domestically and internationally, and impair our international expansion plans. New partnerships and/or acquisitions also may divert management’s attention from other initiatives and/or day-to-day operations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock may be more volatile than the market price of our peers.\nWe believe the market price of our common stock generally has traded at a higher price-earnings ratio than stocks of most of our peer companies as well as the overall market, which typically has reflected market expectations for higher future operating results. At any given point in time, our price-earnings ratio may trade at more than twice the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500. Also, the trading market for our common stock has been volatile at times, including because of adverse publicity events. As a result, if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future, any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant.\nRisks Related to Sustainability Factors\nWe are subject to evolving public disclosure requirements and expectations, including with respect to sustainability matters, that could expose us to numerous risks and could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe are subject to evolving disclosure obligations promulgated by governmental and regulatory organizations relating to sustainability factors that impact our business. These disclosure obligations are complex and not always consistent, making compliance difficult and uncertain. In addition, investors, guests and other stakeholders increasingly are focusing on sustainability matters and related disclosures. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses and management time and attention to comply with these disclosure obligations and stakeholder expectations. For example, measuring Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions relating to our business, developing reduction plans and initiatives, and creating and disclosing achievable reduction goals can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, California’s Greenhouse Gases: Climate-Related Financial Risk Bill and similar proposals by other national, local and international regulatory agencies. We may also communicate certain initiatives, goals and strategies regarding environmental sustainability and human capital management related matters, such as workforce metrics, responsible sourcing and social investments in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. We previously announced that we had set science-based targets validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, and achievement of this goal is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Achievement of this goal may prove to be more difficult and costly than we anticipate.\nIn addition, statements about our sustainability-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. If we are unable to meet our sustainability-related goals or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues, investors, guests and other stakeholders may choose to patronize a competitor that they perceive to be more responsive, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. If our sustainability-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our sustainability goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we could be criticized by anti-ESG stakeholders for the scope or nature of our sustainability initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We could also be subjected to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.\nClimate change and volatile adverse weather conditions could adversely affect our restaurant sales or results of operations.\nThere is growing concern that climate change and global warming has caused and may continue to cause more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations. Adverse weather conditions have in the past and may again impact guest traffic at our restaurants and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires or other natural disasters, cause temporary restaurant closures, all of which negatively impact our restaurant sales. In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs caused by the effects of climate change and diminished energy and water resources. Increasing weather volatility and changes in global weather patterns could reduce crop size and crop quality, or destroy crops altogether, which could result in decreased availability or higher pricing for our produce and other ingredients. We may be forced to source ingredients from new geographic regions, which could impact quality and taste, and increase our costs. These factors are beyond our control and may be unpredictable. Climate change and government regulation relating to climate change mitigation also could result in construction delays for new restaurants and interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities. The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts related to climate change and other sustainability-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we are not able to mitigate them.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic and business factors that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our financial results.\nRestaurant dining generally is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which may be affected by general economic conditions that are beyond our control. Increasing or prolonged high inflation, international, domestic and regional economic conditions, consumer income levels, financial market volatility, a slow or stagnant pace of economic growth, mass layoffs, rising energy costs, rising interest rates, social unrest, military conflicts and governmental, political and budget concerns or divisions may have a negative effect on consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Persistent inflation and concern about a prolonged economic downturn may lead consumers to decrease their discretionary spending. A significant decrease in guest traffic or average transaction size would negatively impact our financial performance. The actual or perceived threat of a pandemic or communicable disease, terrorist attack, mass shooting, heightened security requirements, including cybersecurity, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could harm our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of the above factors or other unfavorable changes in business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs, reduce traffic in our restaurants or limit our ability to increase pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. These factors also could cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close restaurants or delay remodeling of our existing restaurant locations. Further, poor economic conditions may force nearby businesses to shut down, which could reduce traffic to our restaurants or cause our restaurant locations to be less attractive. \nIn addition, we purchase ingredients, packaging and equipment from both U.S. and international suppliers and we may need to increase our menu prices in response to increased inflation, higher taxes, new tariffs on imported goods, wage increases due to a tighter job market and other macro-economic factors. Higher menu prices or the perceived value of our meals relative to competitors may lead consumers to reduce their spending in our restaurants or switch to competitors’ value or lower-priced meals. If competitive or other factors prevent us from offsetting these higher costs through menu price increases, our profitability may decline.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly, including due to factors that are not in our control.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet investors’ expectations for various reasons, including: \n•negative publicity about the safety of our food, employment-related issues, guest safety, litigation or other issues involving our restaurants;\n•fluctuations in supply costs, particularly for our most significant ingredients, and our inability to offset the higher cost with price increases, without adversely impacting guest traffic;\n•our inability to purchase sufficient quantities of our key ingredients and equipment as our restaurant count grows;\n•labor availability and wages of restaurant management and employees;\n•increases in marketing or promotional expenses;\n•the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses, and the operating costs at newly opened restaurants;\n•the impact of inclement weather and natural disasters, such as freezes and droughts, which could decrease guest traffic and increase the costs of ingredients;\n•the amount and timing of stock-based compensation;\n•litigation, settlement costs and related legal expenses;\n•taxes, new or increased tariffs or trade sanctions, asset impairment charges and non-operating costs; and\n•variations in general economic conditions, including the impact of rising inflation and the impact of rising interest rates on consumer demand trends.\nAs a result of any of these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any future period may decrease.",
