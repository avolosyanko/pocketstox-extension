      "text": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS\nThe Company\nKLA Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“KLA” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “our,” “us” or similar references) are suppliers of industry-leading equipment and services that enables innovation throughout the electronics industry. We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing wafers, reticles/masks, chemicals/materials, integrated circuits (“IC” or “chip”), packaged ICs and printed circuit boards (“PCB”), as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our suite of advanced products, coupled with our unique process control software and services, allow us to deliver the solutions our customers need to achieve their technology advancement and high-volume production goals by significantly improving yields, while simultaneously reducing waste, risks and costs. This improves our customers’ overall profitability and return on investment. Our services business, which accounted for approximately 22% of our revenue in fiscal 2025, increases the value of our contract offerings and promotes the extension of system lifetimes.\nKLA was formed as KLA-Tencor Corporation in April 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments Corporation and Tencor Instruments, two long-time leaders in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that began operations in 1975 and 1976, respectively. We are organized into three reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control; Specialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB and Component Inspection. \nWithin the Semiconductor Process Control segment, our comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and software products, as well as related services, help IC, wafer, reticle/mask and chemical/materials manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the entire fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production. These products and services are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help customers accelerate development and production ramp cycles, achieve higher and more stable product yields and improve their overall profitability.\nWithin the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, we develop and sell advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools, which are used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers, including manufacturers of microelectromechanical systems (“MEMS”), radio frequency (“RF”) communication semiconductors, and power semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications.\nWithin the PCB and Component Inspection segment, we enable electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure PCBs, IC substrates and packaged ICs to verify their quality, pattern the desired electronic circuitry on the relevant substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces.\nAdditional information about KLA is available at www.kla.com.

The investor relations website is used to communicate with the public about us and our products, services and other matters. \nIndustry\nOur core focus is enabling technological advances and improving manufacturing yields in the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer - a round disk typically 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is highly sophisticated and involves the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers. Prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish. Other, more specialized wafers, such as epitaxial silicon (“epi”), silicon on insulator (“SOI”), gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”) are also used in the semiconductor industry.\nThe manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a semiconductor chip (or “semiconductor”) is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators \non bare wafers. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors, which performs the “smart” functions; and the upper “interconnect” structure, typically consisting of circuitry, which connects the components in the lower structure. When the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual chips, and the chips that pass functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips. Packaged chips are then mounted onto PCBs for connection to the rest of the electronic system.\nOur business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers. This is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ICs, products utilizing ICs and other electronic components. We do not consider our business to be seasonal. Still, our business has historically been cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor or other industries in which we operate, slowdowns in the worldwide economy, customer consolidation as well as recent political and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.\nCompanies anticipating future market demands by developing and advancing new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are critical goals of modern semiconductor and related electronics manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase IC manufacturers’ revenue and profit for a given product. Leading semiconductor manufacturers invest in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries, new transistor architectures, new power distribution schemes, advanced multi-patterning optical and extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography, and advanced packaging techniques. As design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects. Device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) also become more sensitive to parameters such as linewidth and film thickness variation. New process materials require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face. The continuing evolution of semiconductors to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced IC fabrication facility today can cost well above $10 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In addition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment.\nThe semiconductor capital equipment industry has been experiencing multiple growth drivers bolstered by demand for semiconductors from leading-edge foundry and logic manufacturers to support computational power and connectivity and continued investment by our customers in legacy nodes. Adoption of EUV in high volume manufacturing (“HVM”) for Logic and DRAM memory is driving new process control requirements and growth in key markets for KLA. Demand for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly evident in the 2-nanometer node, which is seeing higher levels of investment and process control intensity, continues to drive investments in AI. Increasing complexity and value of semiconductor packages, particularly for AI and High-performance computing (“HPC”) applications, is also driving significant growth in the advanced packaging business. The digitization of all industries, including 5G markets and advances in healthcare and industrial applications, together with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and intelligence in automobiles, are powering leading-edge design node technology investments and capacity expansions. \nRegionalization of semiconductors has become a trend as access to semiconductors is viewed from the lens of national security. China remains as a major region for the manufacturing of legacy node logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. The Chinese government initiatives around self-sustainability are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector, Commerce has added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List (a list of parties that are generally ineligible to receive U.S. regulated items without prior licensing from Commerce), restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses. It also requires our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List.\nResearch and Development\nThe market for semiconductor and electronics industries is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We make significant investments in product R&D for the timely development of new products and enhancements necessary to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to R&D programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs.\nOur key R&D activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 involved the development of process control and process-enabling solutions for front end semiconductors and advanced packaging. Our primary R&D centers are located in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), India, China, Singapore and Israel. For information regarding our R&D expenses during the last three fiscal years, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is primarily due to our leading technology, which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product R&D. Even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry, we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development to enhance our competitive position.\nCustomers\nWe count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device manufacturers in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our business depends on capital expenditures from these manufacturers which, in turn, depend on many factors including general economic conditions, anticipated market demand, evolving government regulations and capacity constraints. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. \nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues, primarily in the Semiconductor Process Control segment:\nFiscal Year Ended June 30,                                                                                                                                                                      \n2025                                                     2024                                                                 2023                                                              \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited                   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited                   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited    \n                                                                                                                                          Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.                         \nSales, Service and Marketing\nOur sales, service and marketing efforts aim to build deep long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing comprehensive resources for the full breadth of process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions for manufacturing and testing wafers and reticles, a wide variety of ICs, PCBs, IC substrates and packaging as well as general materials research. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales and related service contracts, mostly through our direct sales force.\nWe believe that the size and location of our field sales, service engineering, applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program designed to meet the requirements of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State and the trade regulations of the international jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn addition to sales and service offices in the U.S., we conduct sales, marketing and services out of subsidiaries or branches in many regions; some of the largest include China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the U.K. We believe sales outside the U.S. will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. International revenues accounted for approximately 89% of our total revenues in both of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and 88% of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 18 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInternational sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on \nexport technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.\nProducts and Services\nKLA develops industry-leading process control and yield management solutions and services that enable innovation throughout the semiconductor and related electronics industries. We provide advanced process control and process-enabling solutions for manufacturing wafers, reticles, ICs, packaging, PCBs and IC substrates.

Whether a manufacturing site is producing wafers, reticles, ICs or PCB products, our highly trained service teams collaborate with customers to determine the best products and services to meet technology and business requirements.\nBacklog\nOur backlog, primarily consisting of sales orders where written customer requests have been received, decreased from $9.83 billion as of June 30, 2024, to $7.86 billion as of June 30, 2025, as many of our capacity constrained suppliers made new investments to meet our growing needs, enabling us to deliver products more quickly than in the pandemic and early post-pandemic periods. Lead-time expectations, particularly from our largest customers, reverted to historical levels from the elevated lead times driven by the post-pandemic induced supply chain disruptions, and demands from a large number of new fabs in Asia normalized following multiple years of strong deliveries. We expect to recognize approximately 71% to 76% of this amount as revenue in the next 12 months, 20% to 25% in the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter, but this estimate is subject to constant change. The amount of backlog and timing of revenue recognition is driven by multiple variables, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes in government regulations, the readiness of customer fabs, end market needs for capacity, changes in the estimated versus actual start time of customers’ projects, timing of delivery and installation dates and supply chain constraints. As customers try to balance the evolution of their technological, production or market needs with the timing and content of orders placed with us, there is increased risk of order modifications, pushouts or cancellations. Our backlog on any particular date does not provide meaningful information about the timing of future revenue recognition. \nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\nWe perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy to manufacture components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies acquired from third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities occur in the U.S., Singapore, Israel, Germany, U. K., Italy and China. Our supply chain strategy incorporates considerations for ethical labor practices, responsible minerals sourcing, and Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and there are increasing regulatory expectations on the environmental, social and/or geographic provenance of materials or components that may at times require us to incorporate further such considerations to our supply chain strategy.\nSome critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, “parts”) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials to manufacture and support our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible. Certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, providing financial support and incentives to encourage vendors to increase capacity when required, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers’ often complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition\nThe worldwide market for technologically advanced process control, process-enabling and yield management solutions used by semiconductor and electronics manufacturers is highly competitive, with important competitive factors including system performance, ease of use, reliability, technical service and support, and overall cost of ownership. However, we believe that, while the competitive factors listed are important, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated capabilities into their existing development and manufacturing processes to enhance productivity, improve yields and reduce waste. To remain competitive, we use significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest significantly in product R&D. In each of our product markets, we have many competitors, including companies such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Onto Innovation, Inc. and Lasertec, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved pricing and performance characteristics. We may also face future competition from new market entrants overseas or domestically. Our ability to compete in this area depends upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the U.S., and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region. We maintain our market position by building long-term relationships with our customers to meet their dynamic needs, as well as anticipating future market demands and enabling our customers to accelerate adoption and production of new technologies, as discussed further in the “Industry” section of this Item 1. Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with our industry-leading portfolio of products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share. Should this occur, it could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nPatents and Other Proprietary Rights\nWe protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of IP laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through IP laws. As of June 30, 2025, we owned over 8,500 active patents in the U.S. and other countries and had over 3,500 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2044. In addition, from time to time, we acquire license rights under U.S. and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other security measures.\nAlthough we consider patents and other IP significant to our business, no single patent, copyright or trade secret is essential to us as a whole or to any of our business segments.\nNo assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.\nGovernment Regulations    \nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including, but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data privacy requirements, employment, environmental, foreign exchange controls, health and safety requirements, immigration, import/export requirements, IP and tax. Compliance with these laws and regulations does not presently have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.\nThe recent imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government (“U.S. Tariffs”), along with countermeasures taken by foreign countries, have had an adverse impact on our results of operations, although the impact was not material in fiscal year 2025. There is uncertainty around the ultimate duration, size and substance of the tariffs, including reciprocal actions against the U.S. by other countries.\nFor information about risks related to government regulations, see Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Initiatives\nKLA strives to proactively manage and address the ESG topics most important to our stakeholders. Guided by our values, we have integrated ESG considerations into many of our business practices and policies, and work together with our customers, peers, partners and suppliers to promote improvement in human rights, labor, environment, health and safety, anti-corruption, ethics and management system standards within our operations and our supply chain. Our ESG initiatives are another way KLA seeks to deliver long-term value for our stockholders and draw on our core values.\nWe work across our global footprint to shape a more sustainable future in collaboration with our customers and suppliers. As part of our drive to be better, we have science-based targets to reduce emissions which were validated in 2024 by the Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”). Our targets include using 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. These targets covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions utilize a 2021 baseline.\nIn January 2025, we entered into a long-term virtual power purchase agreement to purchase a portion of the output generated from a solar energy project for a fixed price. As part of this agreement, we will also receive renewable energy credits commensurate with the power we acquire. These credits allow us to characterize a commensurate portion of our energy usage as deriving from renewable energy, helping to reduce our Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, and accelerating the progress towards our targets mentioned above. This agreement had no material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows during the year ended June 30, 2025.\nWe understand that sustainability is a shared endeavor across the value chain and broader economy. Beginning in 2023, KLA engages directly with key supply chain partners (as defined by their share of our purchased goods and services emissions) to reduce their contribution to our Scope 3 footprint, align on common goals and enhance overall transparency. Our company-wide Environmental Management Policy underscores complying with applicable environmental laws and standards across company locations globally. In 2023, we established a global waste and water policy to guide our efforts in these spaces as well. KLA recognizes the importance of protecting and respecting our environment and energy resources throughout our operations for future generations, and follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, transparently reporting climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor various risks, including climate-related and other ESG-related risks, even if some are not currently expected to have a material impact on KLA’s business or financial condition for assessed time horizons.\nFor more information on ESG, see KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report on our website; however, this citation is provided solely for informational purposes and the content of KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing. We include details in our 2023 Global Impact Report and other similar disclosures that are not included in this Form 10-K because we seek to be responsive to various areas of interest of our stakeholders; however, such information generally does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, no assurance can be given that our ESG initiatives will have the intended results or be able to be completed as currently envisioned, whether due to cost, feasibility or other constraints. Our \n2024 Global Impact Report is expected to be published in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and, for the avoidance of doubt, is also not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nHuman Capital Management \nAt KLA, our success is driven by the unique tapestry of backgrounds and experiences that all employees bring to the table. We recognize that our competitive advantage is our people and the technology they develop. We believe it is critical to anticipate, attract, grow and inspire talent that exhibits our core values. As talent and retention continue to be a challenging issue for many companies, we strive to work proactively to address these concerns. We also aim to support employees’ personal and professional growth. Our talent development programs focus on developing the whole person through comprehensive training offerings, employee engagement programs and health and wellness activities. We work to lead through exceptional training programs and professional development while providing our employees with a safe, secure and healthy environment that enables them to thrive and feel included and empowered.\nOur Core Values\nAt KLA, our core values – demonstrating perseverance; striving to be better; being honest, forthright, and consistent; building high-performing teams; and being indispensable to our customers – serve as a foundation for our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders and reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and corporate citizenship in the places where we do business.\nOur Workforce\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 15,000 regular full-time employees and approximately 200 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 18 major regions. Approximately 32% of our regular full-time employees are located in the U.S., 19% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 49% in Asia, with approximately 20% engaged in manufacturing, 27% in R&D, 28% in customer service, 5% in sales and marketing and 20% in other roles. None of our employees are represented by a labor union; however, there is a trade union delegation for our employees in Belgium and our employees in the German operations of our MIE and Laser Imaging Systems business units are represented by employee works councils. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.\nIn fiscal year 2025, our overall employee voluntary turnover rate was under 3.8%.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAt KLA, our talent is the heartbeat of our organization. We value our employees as individuals and aim to recognize and support their needs so they can bring their best selves to work every day. We engage with our employees about what they need to be successful in and beyond the workplace.\nWe conduct an annual compensation review to ensure our total compensation is competitive and fair relative to our peers and internal standards. We link a significant portion of compensation to Company and business unit performance. A broad base of our employees is eligible for our long-term benefit program, to share in our success, through restricted stock units (“RSU”) and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We also provide incentive bonus or profit sharing to employees.\nIn addition to providing our employees with competitive compensation packages, we provide a range of benefits to support employee well-being. Our benefits are designed to meet the needs of employees and their families and may include leave programs (e.g., paid time off, parental leave and bereavement leave), health coverage, income replacement programs, retirement savings schemes and access to employee assistance and work-life programs, based on local needs and practices. In several regions, we offer programs and opportunities to employees to help improve their health and well-being. KLA’s virtual and in-person well-being course offerings encompass physical, financial, and mental health.\nInclusion for All\nWe believe inclusion is everybody’s job, and that making it a reality requires not just policies but also conscious, considerate individual actions, multiplied daily across the organization. Through our ongoing Inclusion for All initiative, we aim to create a sense of belonging that weaves throughout KLA, embracing each individual’s backgrounds and experiences, celebrating everyone’s perspectives and knitting together teams that drive corporate and personal success.\nLearning and Development\nWe offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at KLA. We emphasize stretch assignments, on-the-job development, as well as classroom and online training. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, \nclasses and resources to help them excel in their careers and share what they know with others. Our performance management process includes performance feedback against goals and a review of key competencies that are needed to be successful at KLA and career development discussions.\nWe emphasize frequent one-on-one meetings between managers and employees and regular coaching and feedback sessions. Through coaching and mentorship programs, our employees are inspired to push the boundaries of their comfort zones and seek creative solutions.\nIf our employees pursue external learning opportunities and education, we have tuition reimbursement programs that support that too. Through our partnerships with Stanford University and the University of Michigan, employees can pursue advanced degrees in engineering that are customized for KLA, and the skills and competencies required to support our customers. We also offer a competitive student loan reimbursement program in the U.S.\nWe have a robust succession planning process especially targeted at director level positions and above. Additionally, our Values in Action training, also targeted at the director level and above, provides further guidance on our values, business ethics and our focus on Inclusion For All. Most of our employees are also required to take annual training courses and regular certifications related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy and workplace health and safety.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on several topics. The feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment, identify areas of improvement and guides our decision-making as it relates to people management. We created action plans and involved our workforce in developing potential solutions to address these top concerns. We created initiatives including global manager communications, individual and team coaching and a training course titled “Engaging with Engagement” to enable continuous improvement in employee engagement. In addition, our executives conduct regular quarterly webcasts that enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open Q&A session.\nEmployee Health and Safety \nThe health and safety of our employees is paramount to our success. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through promoting strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program and maintaining detailed emergency and disaster recovery plans.\nOur goal is always zero accidents across our facilities, and to achieve that, we conduct proactive risk assessments and audits to constantly improve our efforts. We implemented a global standard for our incidents to promote consistency across our regions, and continually outperform industry averages for injury rates.\nWe made a commitment to globalize our ISO 45001 (the internationally recognized standard for Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems) certification and expand our ISO 14001 (the internationally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems) certification beyond our larger sites. In calendar-year 2024, we achieved the certification for ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 across our main production and R&D facilities. As of calendar year-end 2024, our sites in Singapore; Newport, Wales; Milpitas, California; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Weilburg, Germany; and our two Israel locations in Migdal HaEmek and Yavne are certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001.\nWe are focused on reducing safety risks across business units and at corporate sites worldwide. We revised our approach to risk assessments to “risk rank” our own operations. We are utilizing this system not only to measure our own performance, but also to help improve the performance of our supply chain and customers. All new hires are required to complete a health and safety training program. In addition, our service technicians are required to achieve and maintain role-specific safety training certifications. Our excellent safety record, which is less than half of the semiconductor industry average, is a tribute to our employees’ efforts, the breadth and depth of our training programs and our dedication to safety policy management.\nFor more information on Human Capital, see KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report on our website; however, this citation is provided solely for informational purposes, and the content of KLA’s 2023 Global Impact Report is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing.",

      "text": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS \nA description of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is provided below.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following summarizes the most material risks that make an investment in our securities risky or speculative. If any of the following risks occur or persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and the price of our common stock could significantly decline.\nCommercial, Operational, Financial and Regulatory Risks \n•Our vulnerability to a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy;\n•Risks related to our international operations;\n•Laws, rules, regulations or other orders that may limit our ability to sell our products or provide service on products previously sold to certain customers;\n•Tariffs and other trade restrictions;\n•IP disputes can be expensive and could result in an inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions;\n•Differing stakeholder expectations, requirements and attention to ESG matters, including any targets or other ESG initiatives, could result in additional costs or risks or adversely impact our business;\n•We may be unable to attract, onboard and retain key personnel;\n•Reliance on third-party service providers could result in disruptions if such third parties cannot perform services for us in a timely manner;\n•Cybersecurity incidents could result in the loss of valuable information or assets or subject us to costly disruption, remediation, regulatory investigations, litigation and reputational damage;\n•We may face disruptions if we cannot access critical information in a timely manner due to system failures;\n•We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\n•Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, public health crises, acts of terrorism or war or other catastrophic events, and the lack of insurance thereof, could significantly disrupt our operations, including affecting the global supply chain, for lengthy periods of time;\n•We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments;\n•We are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits;\n•Economic, political or other conditions in the jurisdictions where we earn profits can impact the tax laws and taxes we pay in those jurisdictions, subsequently impacting our effective tax rate, cash flows and results of operations;\n•Increased compliance costs with federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, as well as NASDAQ requirements; and\n•Changes in accounting pronouncements and laws could have unforeseen effects.\nIndustry Risks\n•We may not be able to keep pace with trends and technological changes in the industries in which we operate;\n•We have a highly concentrated customer base;\n•Prevailing local and global economic conditions may negatively affect the purchasing decisions of our customers; and\n•We are exposed to risks related to the use of AI by us and our competitors. \nBusiness Model and Capital Structure Risks\n•We may not be able to maintain our technology advantage or protect our proprietary rights;\n•We may not be able to compete with new products introduced by our competitors;\n•We may not receive components necessary to build our products in a timely manner;\n•We may fail to operate our business in a manner consistent with our business plan;\n•We may fail to comply with the covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) and Senior Notes (defined below), which could impair our ability to borrow needed funds, or require us to repay debt sooner than we planned;\n•We may not have sufficient financial resources to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due, and our leveraged capital structure may divert resources from operations and other corporate uses;\n•We may not be able to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts;\n•Risks related to our commercial terms and conditions, including our indemnification of third parties, as well as the performance of our products;\n•Our government funding for R&D is subject to termination, audit and any further penalties;\n•We may incur significant restructuring charges or other asset impairment charges or inventory write-offs;\n•We are subject to risks related to receivables factoring arrangements, and compliance risk of certain settlement agreements with the government; and\n•Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole forum for certain actions, which may discourage claims against the Company.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nCommercial, Operational, Financial and Regulatory Risks\nWe are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy.\nDemand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. Economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, and can cause our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders. The tightening of credit markets, rising interest rates and concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers’ ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has, at times in the past, adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and, therefore, has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels.\nIn addition, a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments. Our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. Although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings of such investments, a decline in the capital and financial markets or rising interest rates would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity. If the market value of such investments were to decline, or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nA majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and we maintain significant operations outside the U.S. We are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations. We expect these conditions to continue in the foreseeable future.",
