We focus on developing and maintaining close relationships with our OEM customers’ engineering teams. Competitive success is based on the development of innovative components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs’ technology roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility targets.\nFor additional information about our markets and trends in our markets, please see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGovernment Contracts and Regulation\n Portions of our business, particularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation. We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law.\n We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:\n •require accurate, complete, and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts; \n •impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile;\n •impose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; \n\n\n•impose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and\n •restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data.\n Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing our parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 17% of our sales for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023.\n \nSeasonality\n We believe our sales, in total or in either reportable segment, are not subject to significant seasonal variation. However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance.\nSales Order Backlog\n For each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations by segment, excluding material rights, is shown in the table below:\n\n                October 31, 2024      Percent Expected to be satisfied by September 30, 2025          October 31, 2023      Percent Expected to be satisfied by September 30, 2024    \nAerospace             $2,240,597                                                          55   %            $1,716,613                                                          63   %\nIndustrial               662,750                                                          85   %               773,240                                                          93   %\n                      $2,903,347                                                          62   %            $2,489,853                                                          73   %\n Our remaining performance obligations relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue.\nManufacturing\n We operate manufacturing and assembly plants primarily in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic, and electromechanical systems and components.\nAluminum, iron, and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper, and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics, and product development processes from third parties. Generally, there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.\n We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery, and protection of our intellectual property and processes.\n Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers’ standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers.\nResearch and Development\n We finance our research and development activities primarily with our own funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and concept formulation studies.\n\nWe collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology, new systems, and products that are aligned with our customers’ needs and future performance, which increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance necessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportunities to test new products in order to validate concepts and demonstrate performance in challenging environments. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art test capabilities.\nAerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. We support our engine and airframe customers as they develop next generation designs across the commercial aviation, general aviation, civil private, and military markets. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:\n •aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business, and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines, and turboprop engines;\n •electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and \n •motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems.\n Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs.\nWe developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM International’s LEAP engine program. We also developed actuation system, combustion system, and oil system components for Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbo Fan (“GTF” or “PurePower”) engine program. We continue to support GE Aerospace and CFM for improvements to the LEAP fuel system, and Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney for improvements to the PurePower engine programs.\nIndustrial is focused on developing innovative technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:\n •products that improve the quality of combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers’ gas turbines industrial reciprocating engines fueled by bio-diesel and dual-fuel; \n •electronic devices and software solutions that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment; and \n •advanced predictive intelligence that is integrated into many of our complex products and systems. \n Human Capital\nOur employees (whom we call “members”) are Woodward’s most valuable resource for current and future success. We promote an environment that ensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters growth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All members participate in our success through attractive and aligned total rewards programs. Notable programs we offer to our full-time members include:\n •employer sponsored health insurance;\n •employer 401(k) matching contributions;\n •annual Woodward stock contributions for U.S. members;\n •a tuition assistance program;\n •training and professional development courses through our Woodward University curriculum; and\n •other values-based and technical development training\n\n\nTenure of all employees averages ten years, reflective of our positive workplace culture. Our recruiting team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and reward employee referrals for open positions.\n In addition to our comprehensive investment in our members’ success, we strive to maintain an inclusive environment that values and leverages the uniqueness of each member to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view the combination of diverse perspectives and backgrounds as a powerful force for innovation. To promote diversity and our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion, age, gender or sexual orientation, through our actions and the workplace training programs we provide. We continually strive to harness the diversity of our global workforce by cultivating a climate that permits all our members to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\n The health and safety of our members is also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and precautions to ensure the continued safety and well-being of members. We strive to comply with all federal and local workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance standards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to proactively eliminate risks in the workplace.\n As of October 31, 2024, we employed approximately 9,300 full-time members of which approximately 2,880 were located outside of the United States, with the majority of such members located in Germany, Poland, and China.\nIn the United States, approximately 13% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024. All union members in the United States work for our Aerospace segment. The collective bargaining agreements with our union members are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covered approximately 800 members as of October 31, 2024, expires September 30, 2025. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers approximately 400 members as of October 31, 2024, expires April 23, 2027.\n In Germany, approximately 13% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2024, all of whom work for our Industrial segment. Our Woodward L’Orange members are part of the IG Metall union in Germany. IG Metall covered approximately 1,200 members as of October 31, 2024.\n We believe we have good, collaborative relationships with our union members and the representative unions.\nAlmost all of our other members in the United States were at-will members as of October 31, 2024, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have severance and change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.\n Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works’ councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.\n Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\n We own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law.\nIntellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments.\nWhile our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $440,419 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2024.\nEnvironmental Matters and Climate Change\n The Company is regulated by federal, state, and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.\n We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From time to time, we engage in environmental remediation activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. When it is reasonably probable that we will incur remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured. Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation.\nOur manufacturing facilities generally do not produce volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments.\nDomestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.\nIn 2023, we released our fourth sustainability report, where we continue to build upon our commitments to sustainability in areas of environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance. We apply a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and managing risks across our operations, with the goal to be a supplier, community partner, and employer of choice.\nThe full report can be found on the Sustainability at Woodward section of our website.\n Available Information\n Through a link on the Investor Information section of our website, www.woodward.com, we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Section 16 reports of our officers and directors.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n The following summarizes important factors that could individually, or together with one or more other factors, affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows:\n Industry Risks\n We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we are unable to compete effectively in one or more of our markets, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n We face intense competition from a number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which are larger in size or are divisions of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources. In addition, global competition continues to increase. Changes in competitive conditions, including the availability of new technologies, products and services, the introduction of new channels of distribution, changes in OEM and aftermarket pricing, and further consolidation of companies in our industries, could impact our relationships with our customers and may adversely affect future sales and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurther, the markets in which we operate experience rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our technologies and the technological expertise we have developed and maintained could become less valuable if a competitor were to develop a new technology that would allow it to match or exceed the performance of existing technologies at a lower cost. If we are unable to develop competitive technologies, future sales or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers, which makes our business more vulnerable to fluctuations in sales to these customers and changes in their financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers. We have fewer customers than many companies with similar sales volumes. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, sales to our largest 5 customers represented approximately 35% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 31% of our accounts receivable. If any of our significant customers were to change suppliers, in-source production, institute significant restructuring or cost-cutting measures, or experience financial distress, these significant customers may substantially reduce, or otherwise be unable to pay for, purchases from us. Accordingly, our consolidated net sales could decrease significantly, or we may experience difficulty collecting, or be unable to collect, amounts due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe long sales cycle, customer evaluation process, and implementation period of our products and services may increase the costs of obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of sales cycles and our inventory requirements.\n Our products and services are technologically complex and require significant capital commitments. Prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems. Accordingly, customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product’s performance and compatibility to commit to an order. In addition, orders expected in one quarter may shift to another quarter or be cancelled with little advance notice as a result of customers’ budgetary constraints, internal acceptance reviews, and other factors affecting the timing of customers’ purchase decisions. The difficulty in forecasting demand increases the challenge in anticipating sales cycles and our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods and could result in inventory write-offs, or could cause us to under-produce finished goods. Any such over-production or under-production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Our strategic joint venture with GE Aerospace may make it more difficult to secure long-term sales in certain aerospace markets.\nIn January 2016, Woodward and GE, consummated the formation of a strategic joint venture (the “JV”) and since April 2024, GE has been acting through GE Aerospace. The JV agreement does not restrict Woodward from entering into any market; however, consolidation in the aircraft engine market is increasingly prevalent, resulting in fewer engine manufacturers, and thus it may become more difficult for Woodward to secure new business with GE Aerospace competitors on similar product applications both within and outside the specific markets the JV operates. Additionally, if GE\n\nAerospace fails to win new content in the market space covered by the JV, Woodward may be prevented from expanding content on future commercial aircraft engines in those markets.\n Commercial, Financial, and Regulatory Risks\n Suppliers may be unable to provide us with materials of sufficient quality or quantity to meet our production needs at favorable prices or at all which may adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nWe are dependent upon suppliers for parts and raw materials used in the manufacture of products that we sell to our customers, and our raw material costs are subject to commodity market fluctuations and have been impacted by the current inflationary environment. We have experienced shortages of certain parts and raw materials due to challenges in our supply chain, although we have made strategic investments to simplify and strengthen our supply chain. We may continue to experience shortages of parts or raw materials for the same or other reasons, such as the loss of a significant supplier, high overall demand creating shortages in parts and supplies we use, financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters, fluctuations in commodity prices, the imposition of tariffs or other duties, or production or distribution difficulties that may affect one or more of our suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, or logistics support or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Some of our suppliers have experienced, and others may similarly experience, financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, and, as a result, we have from time to time been, and may in the future be, unable to meet commitments to our customers and/or incur additional costs. Our customers rely on us to provide on-time delivery and have certain rights if our delivery standards are not maintained. A significant increase in our supply costs, including for raw materials that are subject to commodity price fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and/or the imposition of tariffs, or a protracted interruption of supplies for any reason, could result in the delay of one or more of our customer contracts, increase our costs, result in lost revenue or could damage our reputation and relationships with customers. In addition, quality and sourcing issues that our suppliers may experience can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and may result in liability or reputational harm to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to manage our expenses in connection with sales increases, sales decreases, or if we experience change in product mix.\nSome of our expenses are relatively fixed in relation to changes in sales volume and are difficult to adjust in the short term. Expenses driven by business activity other than sales level and other long-term expenditures, such as fixed manufacturing costs, capital expenditures, and research and development expenses may be difficult to reduce in a timely manner in response to a reduction in sales. In periods of rapid sales increases it may be difficult to quickly increase our production of finished goods because of our long manufacturing lead times. If a sudden, unanticipated need for raw materials, components and labor arises, we could experience difficulties in sourcing these items at a favorable cost, in sufficient quantities or at all. These factors could result in delays in fulfilling customer sales contracts, lost revenue, damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers, and an inability to meet market demand, which in turn could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities or responding to competitive pressures and could result in an increase in costs leading to a decrease in net earnings or even net losses. In addition, we sell products that have varying profit margins, and fluctuations in the mix of sales of our various products may affect our overall profitability.\nReductions, delays or changes in U.S. Government spending could adversely affect our business.\n Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers, such as tier-one prime contractors, utilizing our parts and subassemblies, accounted for approximately 17% of total sales in both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023.\n The U.S. Government participates in a wide variety of operations, including homeland defense, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and other defense-related operations that employ our products and services. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical in nature and is subject to periodic congressional authorization and appropriation actions. The level of U.S. defense spending is hard to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors outside of our control such as changes in the perceived threat environment, prevailing U.S. foreign policy, changes in security, defense, and intelligence strategies and priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending, the macroeconomic environment, tax policy, budget deficits and competing budget priorities, and the political environment and future potential government shutdowns.\nDefense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety, but we can provide no assurance that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that\n\nwould benefit our business. Decreases in U.S. Government defense spending, changes in the spending allocation, phase-outs or terminations of certain aerospace and defense programs on which we have content could have a material adverse effect on our sales unless they are offset by other aerospace and defense programs and opportunities. If the priorities of the U.S. Government change and/or defense spending is reduced or delayed for any of the reasons discussed above, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by risks unique to government contracting.\nAs a result of our contracts with the U.S. Government, we are subject to certain unique risks, including the risks set forth below:\n•Our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of a failure by us or our customers to perform under the applicable contract. If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S. Government, our backlog would be reduced, in accordance with contract terms, by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. In addition, we are not the prime contractor on most of our contracts for supply to the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor.\n •We must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers. The U.S. Government may change procurement laws and regulations from time to time. A violation of U.S. Government procurement laws or regulations, a change in U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, or a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability, debarment, or suspension and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. \n •We are subject to government inquiries, audits, and investigations due to our business relationships with the U.S. Government and the heavily regulated industries in which we do business. In addition, our contract costs are subject to audits by the U.S. Government. U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors and subcontractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract would be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, would be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholdings on billed receivables, penalties, and reduced future business. Any inquiries or investigations, including those related to our contract pricing, could potentially result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, suspension, and/or debarment from participating in future business opportunities with the U.S. Government. Such actions could harm our reputation, even if such allegations are later determined to be unfounded, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n The occurrence of one or more of these risks, some of which are out of our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur debt obligations and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our business strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder benefits from a change of control event.\n As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was $872,470, including $475,000 in unsecured notes denominated in U.S. dollars issued in private placements and $178,624 of unsecured notes denominated in Euros issued in private placements. We are obligated to make interest and scheduled principal payments under the agreements governing our long-term debt, which requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, and which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and mergers and acquisitions. These debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness. Further, we may require additional capital to repay our debt obligations when they mature, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n\nOur existing revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain certain leverage ratios and minimum levels of consolidated net worth. Certain of these agreements require us to repay outstanding borrowings with portions of the proceeds we receive from certain sales of property or assets and specified future debt offerings.\nThese financial covenants place certain restrictions on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These covenants include limitations or restrictions, among other things, on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n •incur additional indebtedness; \n •pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments; \n •purchase or redeem stock; \n •issue stock of our subsidiaries; \n •make domestic and foreign investments and extend credit; \n •engage in transactions with affiliates; \n •transfer and sell assets; \n •effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and \n •create liens on our assets to secure debt.\n These agreements contain certain customary events of default, including certain cross-default provisions related to other outstanding debt arrangements. Any breach of the covenants under these agreements or other event of default could cause a default under these agreements and/or a cross-default under our other debt arrangements, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default under certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required settlement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and available cash balances may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders or note holders may be entitled to obtain a lien or institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could impact our future profitability.\n We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution mix of operating income among these different jurisdictions. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred and reflects various estimates, projections, and assumptions that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our future operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate, which could be caused by, among other things:\n •changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates; \n •changes in our overall profitability;\n •changes in rules or interpretations of existing tax laws; \n •changes in U.S. federal tax legislation and tax rates;\n •changes in state or non-U.S. government tax legislation and tax rates; \n •changes in tax incentives;\n •changes in U.S. GAAP; \n •changes in the projected realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities; \n •changes in management’s assessment of the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore; \n •changes in management’s intentions regarding the amount of earnings reinvested offshore; and \n •the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.\n\n\nWe derive a significant amount of revenue and obtain components from outside of the United States; accordingly, we are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.\n In fiscal year 2024, approximately 49% of our total sales were made to customers in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including products manufactured in the United States and sold outside the United States as well as products manufactured in international locations). We also purchase raw materials and components from suppliers outside the United States. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n •transportation delays and interruptions; \n •political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n •natural disasters or pandemics;\n •terrorism, war, and international tensions and conflicts; \n •the imposition of taxes, import and export controls, duties and tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions; \n •fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n •different and changing regulatory environments; \n •cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations governing various matters worldwide;\n •cost of labor, labor shortages, and other changes in labor conditions;\n •the potential for nationalization of enterprises; \n •potential limitations on the Company’s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, including protection of intellectual property; \n •difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; \n •potentially adverse tax consequences, including limitations on repatriations of earnings; and \n •difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. \n The implementation of tariffs could increase the cost of certain commodities and/or limit their supply. Over the longer term, tariffs could significantly increase our costs and our ability to pass such increased costs along to our customers may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to and must comply with U.S. laws restricting or otherwise prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries and with certain parties, including those on exports imposed under the U.S. Export Control Laws and Sanctions Programs. These laws and regulations change from time to time and may restrict sales to other countries or parties.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. We operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corruption to some degree. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other similar anti-bribery law or regulatory violations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Also, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Changes in the estimates of fair value of reporting units or of long-lived assets, particularly goodwill, may result in future impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\n At September 30, 2024, we had $806,643 of goodwill, representing approximately 18% of our total assets. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Future goodwill impairment charges may occur if estimates of fair values decrease, which would reduce future earnings. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges if asset utilization declines, if customer demand decreases, or for a number of other reasons, which would reduce future earnings. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions of the fair value of our reporting units, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units will prove to be accurate projections of future performance, and any material error in our estimates and assumptions, could result in us needing to take a material impairment charge, which would have the effects discussed above.\nOur inability to retain key personnel or attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to operate successfully.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, competition for technical personnel is intense and our future performance is highly dependent on our ability to hire, train, assimilate, and retain a qualified workforce. Additionally, it is important we hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions, and business practices to support our international operations. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, challenges associated with retaining qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities, and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs.\n Our financial and operating performance depends on continued access to a stable workforce and on favorable labor relations with our employees.\n We rely on a highly trained workforce due to the specialized nature of our business. Further, approximately 13% of our workforce in the United States is unionized, and certain of our operations in the United States and internationally involve different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works’ councils. We periodically need to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, and any failure to negotiate new agreements or extensions in a timely manner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Any significant increases in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, including any conflicts with works’ councils or unions, or slowdowns or work stoppages at any of our locations, whether due to employee turnover, changes in availability of qualified technical personnel, failure to have a collaborative and effective relationship with our employees, including our union employees, or an effective collective bargaining agreement in place with our union employees, or otherwise, could impair our ability to supply products or fulfill orders, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, our relationships with customers, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further increases in labor costs could significantly reduce our profit margins if we are unable to flow such costs through to our customers.\n Our operations and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt our operations.\nOur operations and sources of supply could be disrupted by unforeseen events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, any of which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, public health concerns and pandemics, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, equipment failures, power outages, threats to physical security of our facilities, assets or people, or the security of our information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and systems or other unforeseen events could result in physical damage to or other disruption of, and complete or partial closure of, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or could cause temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products and significant delays in the shipment of products and the provision of services, which could in turn cause the loss of sales and customers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events. Accordingly, disruption of our operations or the operations of a significant supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Failure to develop, obtain, enforce, and protect intellectual property rights or third parties claims that we are infringing their intellectual property could harm our business.\n Our success depends in part on our ability to develop technologies and inventions and other intellectual property, and obtain intellectual property rights and enforce such intellectual property rights worldwide. In this regard, we rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we do business, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions.\nHowever, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new technologies and inventions or, if we do, the scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our competitors. Further, our existing and future intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. The technologies\n\nand inventions developed by us in the future may not be considered valuable by customers or provide us with a competitive advantage, or competitors may develop similar or identical technologies and inventions independently of us and before we do.\nEffective protection of intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. Competitors and other third parties may also challenge the ownership, validity, and/or enforceability of our patents or other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. To the extent we do assert our intellectual property rights against third parties, we may not be successful and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, or disclosure of our trade secrets.\nThird parties may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our current or future technologies are not, infringing or violating intellectual property rights of third parties, or will not do so in the future. In the event we face claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may face expensive litigation or indemnification obligations, be required to enter into licenses, and may be prevented from selling existing products and pursuing product development or commercialization. Even if such claims are without merit, we may be required to expend significant time and resources on the defense of such claims. If we are unable to sufficiently protect our patent and other proprietary rights or if we infringe on or misappropriate proprietary rights of others, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n We are subject to legal proceedings, investigations, claims and/or regulatory proceedings which could have a significant impact on our business and operations.\nWe are currently involved or may become involved in legal, regulatory, and other proceedings. These proceedings may include, without limitation, product liability matters, intellectual property matters, contract disputes or claims, pending or threatened litigation, governmental investigations, as well as employment, tax, environmental, or other matters. These proceedings could lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, business remedies, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material, and of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even if the legal proceedings we face are decided in our favor, or are unfounded, we may incur material expenses and such matters may require significant management attention, and may harm our reputation with customers, employees or investors. We accrue for known individual matters if we believe it is probable that the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved using estimates of the most likely amount of loss. However, estimating possible losses involves significant judgment and outcomes are unpredictable, therefore, actual losses may exceed our estimates.\n Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network interruptions or intrusions.\nWe depend heavily on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our IT and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property, classified information, customer information, supplier information, and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Also, due to political uncertainty and hostile military actions, we may be subject to heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security breaches initiated by nation-state or affiliated actors.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced cyberattacks on our IT infrastructure and systems. We may become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties, either directly or indirectly via our supply chain or third-party vendors, seeking unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data or to disrupt our operations or our ability to provide services. There is also a danger of loss, misuse, theft, unavailability, or unauthorized disclosure or other processing of information or assets (including source code), or damage to or other compromise of systems, components, and other IT assets, including the introduction of malicious code or other vulnerabilities by people who obtain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. There are many different techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data, and such techniques continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, and the adversaries are becoming more advanced, including nation states and actors sponsored by or affiliated with nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect national security information, and other actors with substantial financial and technological resources. These techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, phishing and other means of social engineering, and other means of causing system or network disruptions, obtaining unauthorized access to data or systems, or causing other cybersecurity breaches and\n\nincidents. Additionally, system and service disruptions, and cybersecurity breaches or incidents, may result from employee or contractor error, negligence, or malfeasance. Further, there have been and may continue to be cyberattacks on, and other attempts to compromise the security of, the supply chain. We may experience security breaches or incidents resulting from tools, services, or other third-party components and security vulnerabilities within, or introduced by, such tools, services, or components. Due to the rapidly evolving threat environment and other factors, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Further, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the full impact of any future security breach or incident cannot be predicted.\nWe have implemented various measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, independent third party security assessments, maintenance of backup systems, and the use of disaster recovery sites. In addition, we have, among other things, endeavored to align our practices and procedures with recognized IT security frameworks and select recommended practices, and through corroboration of our policies and procedures with local and federal agencies. Nonetheless, our IT infrastructure, systems, networks, products, solutions, and services remain potentially vulnerable to numerous additional known or unknown threats. Although we have implemented measures to prevent, detect, and respond to malicious activity, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective or sufficient to prevent a cyberattack or other means of effecting cybersecurity breaches or incidents.\nIf any of our IT infrastructure or systems are damaged, disrupted, or are otherwise impacted by security breaches or incidents, whether from cybersecurity attacks or other causes, or if we suffer any security breach or incident involving unauthorized access to, misuse, acquisition, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of our data or other data we maintain or otherwise process, we could experience significant operational stoppages, disruptions, delays, and/or other detrimental impacts on our operations or investment in research, and may face increased costs, including increased costs of implementing new data protection and security measures, policies, and procedures, and costs associated with remediating and otherwise responding to the security breach or incident. Any such security breach or incident or the perception that it has occurred, also may result reputational damage and increased operational costs, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and orders, litigation or other demands, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, fines or penalties relating to actual or alleged violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships, and other costs and liabilities. Such impacts could result in diminished competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, any unauthorized disclosure or use or acquisition of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of intellectual property protection, and otherwise reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability relating to any actual or potential disruption or other security breach or incident. We cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nData privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity may require significant resources and present certain risks.\n We collect, store, and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including personal data and other information that is subject to laws, regulations, customer-imposed controls, or other actual or asserted obligations. The laws, regulations, standards, and other actual and asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity to which we may be subject, in the U.S. and globally, are evolving. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements applicable to processing personal data and provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance, and in the U.S., California and numerous other states have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, with other states considering such laws. Many jurisdictions around the world have passed or are considering laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, including laws that impose cross-border data transfer restrictions and require certain personal data to be maintained on local servers.\n Any actual or perceived failure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual or other actual or asserted obligations to which we are or are alleged to be subject relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity could result in claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations and other proceedings, as well as damage to our reputation. These could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, fines, penalties, and other damages and liabilities, and harm to our customer\n\nrelationships, our market position, and our ability to attract new customer engagements. Any of these could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, potentially in a material manner.\n Increasing emission standards that drive certain product sales may be eased or delayed, which could reduce our competitive advantage.\n We sell components and systems that have been designed to meet strict emission standards, including standards that have not yet been implemented but are expected to be implemented soon. If these emission standards are eased, developed products may become unnecessary and/or our future sales could be lower as potential customers select alternative products or delay adoption of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPrices for fossil fuels may increase significantly and disproportionately to other sources of fuels used for power generation, which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Commercial producers of electricity use many of our components and systems, most predominately in their power plants that use natural gas as their fuel source. Commercial producers of electricity are often in a position to manage the use of different power plant facilities and make decisions based on operating costs. Compared to other sources of fuels used for power generation, natural gas prices have increased slower than fuel oil, but about the same as coal. This increase in natural gas prices and any future increases, whether in absolute dollars or relative to other fuel costs such as oil, could impact the sales mix of our components and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nLong-term reduced commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and other minerals may depress the markets for certain of our products and services, particularly those from our Industrial segment.\n Many of our Industrial segment OEM and aftermarket customers and our Aerospace segment rotorcraft product lines’ customers provide goods and services that support various industrial extraction activities, including mining, oil and gas exploration and extraction, and transportation of raw materials from extraction sites to refineries and/or processing facilities. Long-term lower prices for commodities such as oil, natural gas, gold, tin, and various other minerals could reduce exploration activities and place downward pressure on demand for our goods and services that support exploration and extraction activities.\nBusiness Risks\n Our product development activities may not be successful, may be more costly than anticipated, or we may not be able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure.\n Our business involves a significant level of product development activities, generally in connection with our customers’ development activities. Industry standards, customer expectations, or other products may emerge that could render one or more of our products or services less desirable or obsolete. Additionally, our competitors may develop new technology, or more efficient ways to produce their existing products that could cause our existing products or services to become less desirable or obsolete. Maintaining our market position requires continued investment in research and development. During an economic downturn or a subsequent recovery, we may need to maintain our investment in research and development, which may limit our ability to reduce these expenses in proportion to a sales shortfall.\nIn addition, increased investments in research and development may divert resources from other potential investments in our business, such as acquisitions or investments in our facilities, processes, and operations. If these activities are not as successful as currently anticipated, are not completed on a timely basis, or are more costly than currently anticipated, or if we are not able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure, then our future sales, margins and/or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Product liability claims, product recalls or other liabilities associated with the products and services we provide may force us to pay substantial damage awards and other expenses.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products and the services we provide expose us to risks of product and other tort claims, and any resulting liability. We currently have and have had in the past product liability claims relating to our products, and we will likely be subject to additional product liability claims in the future for past, current, and future products. Some of these claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\n\noperations, and cash flows. We also provide certain services to our customers and are subject to claims with respect to the services provided. In providing such services, we may rely on subcontractors to perform all or a portion of the contracted services. It is possible that we could be liable to our customers for work performed by a subcontractor.\nRegardless of the outcome, product liability claims can be expensive to defend, can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, and can cause reputational damage. While we believe that we have appropriate insurance coverage available to us related to any such claims, our insurance may not cover all liabilities or be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. An unsuccessful result in connection with a product liability claim, where the liabilities are not covered by insurance or for which indemnification or other recovery is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, and other transactions we enter into could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations, result in operating difficulties, harm our business, and negatively impact our results of operations.\n As part of our business strategy, we have pursued, and expect to pursue acquisitions of other companies and assets. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. If we are able to complete a transaction. The success of these transactions depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated. The integration of these acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management’s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We may also incur costs and divert management attention to acquisitions that are never consummated.\nDifficulties in the integration of the acquired business may include consolidating the operations, processes, and systems of the acquired business, retaining and motivating key management and employees, and integrating existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Even if integration is successful, the financial and operational results may differ materially from our assumptions and forecasts due to unforeseen expenses, delays, conditions, and liabilities. Evolving regulations such as changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll, or pension policies could increase the expected costs of acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the agreed upon purchase price. In addition, we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following an acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, and other liabilities.\n Many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management’s time and attention. Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. We may experience difficulty separating out portions of, or entire, businesses, incur loss of revenue or experience negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. In addition, these types of transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction, or we may remain liable for certain matters. We are not likely to have the same level of control over the divested business, and the performance of those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur restructuring activities may reduce our profitability, and may not have the intended effects.\n From time to time, we have implemented restructuring and other actions designed to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency, and position the Company for long-term profitable growth. Historically, our restructuring activities have included workforce management and other restructuring charges related to acquired businesses. Further, we may decide to implement restructuring or alignment activities in the future, which may involve, among other things, closing plants, moving production lines, or making additions, reductions, or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods.\n\n\nRestructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot be sure that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others, higher than expected severance costs related to staff reductions, higher than expected costs of closing plants, higher costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed, higher than expected operating costs associated with moving production lines, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan, and other unexpected costs associated with operating the business.\n If we are unable to structure our operations in the light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Our manufacturing activities may result in future environmental costs or liabilities.\n We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We are subject to a substantial number of costly regulations and we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements in all countries in which we operate. The risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will not incur additional material costs or liabilities as a result of complying with these requirements.\nIn addition, we may be subject to other environmental remediation costs such as participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. As a result, we may incur material costs or liabilities or be required to undertake future environmental remediation activities that could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Failure of our production lines, or those of our subcontractors, to meet required certification standards could disrupt production.\n Our existing production lines, as well as the production lines of our subcontractors, are sometimes required to pass varying levels of qualification with certain of our customers. Some of our customers require that our production lines pass their specific qualification standards and that we, and any subcontractors that we may use, be registered under or certified to certain U.S. or international quality standards. We may be unable to obtain, maintain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, a certification or registration to a required quality standard. A delay in obtaining, or the failure to obtain a necessary quality certification or registration could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.",
