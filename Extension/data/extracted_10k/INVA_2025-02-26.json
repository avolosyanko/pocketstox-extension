      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\n Innoviva, Inc. (“Innoviva”, the “Company”, the “Registrant” or “we” and other similar pronouns) is a company with a core royalties portfolio, a leading critical care and infectious disease platform known as Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics (“IST”), and a portfolio of strategic investments in other healthcare assets.\nOur royalty portfolio contains respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited (“GSK”), including RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, “FF/VI”) and ANORO® ELLIPTA® (umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol, “UMEC/VI”). Under the Long-Acting Beta2 Agonist (“LABA”) Collaboration Agreement, Innoviva is entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion; and royalties from the sales of ANORO® ELLIPTA®, which tier upward at a range from 6.5% to 10%.\nOur commercial and marketed products include GIAPREZA®(angiotensin II), approved in the United States (“U.S.”) to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock, and XERAVA®(eravacycline) approved in the U.S. for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in adults. On May 23, 2023, XACDURO®(formerly known as sulbactam-durlobactam or SUL-DUR), was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and we commenced commercial sales of XACDURO® in the third quarter of 2023. On December 14, 2024, we entered into an exclusive distribution and license agreement with Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd, Allschwil (SIX: BSLN) (“Basilea”) for the commercialization of ZEVTERA® (ceftobiprole), an advanced-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, in the U.S. We continue our efforts to submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for zoliflodacin, a potential first in class, single dose oral drug for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, to the U.S. FDA in early 2025. Overall, we have a wholly owned robust critical care and infectious disease operating platform with a hospital focus anchored by four differentiated products with significant growth potential and a promising drug candidate.\n In addition, we own other strategic healthcare assets, such as a significant stake in Armata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a leader in development of bacteriophages with potential use across a range of infectious and other serious diseases. We also have economic interests in other healthcare companies.\n Our focus on capital allocation and shareholder value maximization has led our company to a meaningful transformation over the last two years. In 2022, our financials contained royalty revenues from TRELEGY®ELLIPTA® which was divested mid-year in an economically accretive transaction. Additionally, our acquisition and integration of operating companies, Entasis Therapeutics Holding Inc. (“Entasis”) and La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (“La Jolla”), and advancement of our therapeutics portfolio further changed the structure of our financials compared to prior years. Through these changes, we believe we are well-positioned to create significant long-term shareholder value.\n Our headquarters are located at 1350 Old Bayshore Highway, Suite 400, Burlingame, CA 94010. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in November 1996 under the name Advanced Medicine, Inc., and began operations in May 1997. It later changed its name to Theravance, Inc. in April 2002, and rebranded, changing its name to Innoviva, Inc. in January 2016.\n Our Strategy\n Our corporate strategy is currently focused on increasing stockholder value by, among other things, maximizing the potential value of our respiratory assets partnered with GSK, creating value through our critical care and infectious disease platform, optimizing our operations, and augmenting capital allocation. We continue to diversify our royalty management business through actively pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of promising companies and assets in the healthcare industry and enhancing the returns on our capital.\nOur Royalty Product Portfolio\n Our Relationship with GSK\n LABA Collaboration\n In November 2002, we entered into our LABA Collaboration Agreement with GSK to develop and commercialize once‑daily products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) and asthma. The collaboration has developed three combination products, two of which we still retain rights in. Those two are as follows:\n •RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (“FF/VI”) (BREO® ELLIPTA® is the proprietary name in the U.S. and Canada and RELVAR® ELLIPTA® is the proprietary name outside the U.S. and Canada), a once-daily combination medicine consisting of a LABA, vilanterol (“VI”), and an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), fluticasone furoate (“FF”), and,\n •ANORO® ELLIPTA® (“UMEC/VI”), a once-daily medicine combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), umeclidinium bromide (“UMEC”), with a LABA, VI.\n As a result of the launch and approval of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® in the U.S., Japan and Europe, in accordance with the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we paid milestone fees to GSK totaling $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The milestone fees paid to GSK were recognized as capitalized fees paid, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the products.\n Competition\n We anticipate that RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI) and ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI) will compete with a number of approved bronchodilator drugs alone or in combination, including each other and drug candidates under development that are designed to treat asthma and COPD. These include but are not limited to:\n •Advair®/Seretide™ Diskus®/HFA® (salmeterol and fluticasone propionate as a combination) marketed by GSK\n •Symbicort® (formoterol and budesonide as a combination) marketed by AstraZeneca\n •AirDuo Respiclick® (salmeterol and fluticasone propionate), a non-substitutable generic version of Advair, marketed by TEVA\n •Spiriva® Handihaler® and Spiriva® Respimat® (tiotropium) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim\n •Dulera® (formoterol and mometasone as a combination) marketed by Merck\n •Tudorza® Pressair® (aclidinium) marketed by AstraZeneca and Seebri® Breezehaler® (glycopyrronium) marketed by Novartis outside the U.S. and Sunovion in the U.S.\n •Incruse® Ellipta® (umeclidinium) and Arnuity® Ellipta® (fluticasone furoate) (Innoviva is not entitled to any royalties from either product)\n •Foradil® Aerolizer®/Oxis® Turbuhaler® (formoterol) marketed by a number of companies\n •Striverdi® Respimat® (olodaterol) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim\n •Onbrez® Breezehaler® (E.U.)/Arcapta® Neohaler® (U.S.) (indacaterol) marketed by Novartis\n •Ultibro® Breezehaler® (E.U.)/Utibron® Neohaler® (U.S.) (indacaterol combined with glycopyrronium bromide) developed by Novartis and approved and launched in Europe and Japan in the year ended December 31, 2013 as a once-daily treatment for COPD. In the U.S., the product was approved in October 2015 at a lower strength as a twice-daily COPD treatment, and was licensed to Sunovion in December 2016, and launched in May 2017\n •Stiolto (U.S.)/Spiolto (E.U.) Respimat® (tiotropium combined with olodaterol) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of COPD\n •Bevespi Aerosphere® (glycopyrronium bromide in combination with formoterol fumarate) marketed by AstraZeneca\n\n\n•Duaklir® Genuair® (aclidinium bromide in combination with formoterol fumarate) developed by AstraZeneca as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment for COPD and approved in November 2014 in the EU and March 2019 in the U.S.\n •Atectura® Breezhaler® (indacaterol in combination with mometasone) marketed by Novartis\n •Trimbow® (a fixed-dose, twice daily combination of formoterol, beclomethasone and glycopyrronium) manufactured by Chiesi and indicated for use in COPD in the E.U.\n •Foster (beclomethasone dipropionate in combination with formoterol fumarate) manufactured by Chiesi and indicated for use in asthma and COPD outside the U.S.\n •Enerzair® Breezehaler® (a fixed-dose combination of indacaterol, mometasone and glycopyrronium) developed by Novartis as a triple therapy/single inhaler for the treatment of asthma and approved in the E.U., Canada, and Japan\n •Breztri® Aerosphere® (fixed dose combination of formoterol, glycopyrronium and budesonide) developed by AstraZeneca as a triple therapy single inhaler twice-daily medication for COPD and approved in the U.S. in July 2020\n •Nucala® (mepolizumab; an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody) developed by GSK for add on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients 12 years and older and approved in the U.S. in June 2019\n •Xolair® (omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody) developed by Genentech for patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and approved in 2003. Single-dose pre-filled syringes were approved by the FDA in September 2018\n •Cinqair® (anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody for the add-on maintenance treatment of adults with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype) marketed by TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n •Dupixent® (dupilamab, an injectable IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor) developed by Sanofi Genzyme and approved by the FDA in October 2018 as an add-on maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma\n •Fasenra® (benralizumab, an injectable anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) for the treatment of severe asthma in patients 12 years of age and older marketed by AstraZeneca. Fasenra Pen pre-filled auto-injector was approved by the FDA for self-administration in November 2019\n •Singulair® (monteleukast), an orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist for the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma in patients 12 months of age and older marketed by Merck\n •Tezspire® (tezepelumab-ekko), an injectable monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cytokine thought to be critical in the initiation and persistence of airway inflammation. Co-developed by Astra Zeneca and Amgen for the treatment of severe asthma. The FDA approved the Tezspire solution for subcutaneous injection in December 2021; it is indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma \n •Ohtuvayre® (ensifentrine), an inhaled dual phosphodiesterase inhibitor indicated for the miantenace treatment of COPD in adults with moderate-to-severe symptoms.\n In addition, several firms have developed and launched new formulations of Advair/Seretide (salmeterol /fluticasone propionate) and Symbicort (formoterol fumerate/budesonide) which may be marketed as generics or branded generics relative to the existing products from GSK and AstraZeneca, respectively. All of these efforts represent potential competition for any of our partnered products. Efforts have intensified following the publication of FDA draft guidance for the approval of fully substitutable versions of Advair and Symbicort in late 2013 and mid-2015, respectively.\n\nIn general, these manufacturers are required to conduct a number of clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetic and device studies to demonstrate equivalence to branded products already approved by the FDA. These studies are designed to demonstrate that the generic product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, exposure and clinical efficacy as the branded product. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same exacting quality standards as branded products, may be significantly less costly to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product and products that may compete with such branded product is typically lost to the generic product. In addition, in April 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document covering Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Trifenatate (FF/VI), the active ingredients used in RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®.\n Our Integrated Critical Care / Infectious Disease Assets\n Commercial and Marketed Products\n Our critical care and infectious disease portfolio was formed through the 2022 acquisitions of Entasis and La Jolla, which we have continued to grow through our license agreement with Basilea. It comprises four differentiated commercial stage products and a pipeline. The following table summarizes our commercial and marketed products:\n![alt  img12876764_0.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_0.jpg)\n \n \n\n(1)For U.S. and European approval.\n (2)U.S.: GIAPREZA is a vasoconstrictor to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock.\n (3)European Union: GIAPREZA is indicated for the treatment of refractory hypotension in adults with septic or other distributive shock who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume restitution and application of catecholamines and other available vasopressor therapies.\n (4)U.S.: XERAVA is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (“cIAI”) in patients 18 years of age and older.\n (5)European Union: XERAVA is indicated for the treatment of cIAI in adults.\n (6)U.S.: XACDURO is a co-packaged product containing sulbactam, a beta-lactam antibacterial and beta lactamase inhibitor, and durlobactam, a beta lactamase inhibitor, indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex.\n (7)U.S.: ZEVTERA is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia) (SAB), including those with right-sided infective endocarditis, adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and adult and pediatric patients (3 months to less than 18 years old) with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).\n\n\n(8)European Union: ZEVTERA is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP, excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients 18 years of age and older.\n \nGIAPREZA® (angiotensin II)\n GIAPREZA®(angiotensin II) injection is approved by the U.S. FDA as a vasoconstrictor indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. GIAPREZA is approved by the European Commission (“EC”) and by the Great Britain Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) for the treatment of refractory hypotension in adults with septic or other distributive shock who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume restitution and application of catecholamines and other available vasopressor therapies. GIAPREZA mimics the body’s endogenous angiotensin II peptide, which is central to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (“RAAS”), which in turn regulates blood pressure. GIAPREZA is marketed in the U.S. by La Jolla and is marketed in Europe and Great Britain by PAION Deutschland GmbH, a subsidiary of the Humanwell Healthcare Group, on behalf of La Jolla.\nAngiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock (“ATHOS-3”)\n \nGIAPREZA was approved by the U.S. FDA, EC and MHRA based on the results of ATHOS-3, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2017. ATHOS-3 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 321 adults with septic or other distributive shock who remained hypotensive despite fluid and vasopressor therapy received either GIAPREZA or placebo, both in addition to background vasopressor therapy. The primary endpoint was mean arterial pressure (“MAP”) response, defined as a MAP of 75 mm Hg or higher or an increase in MAP from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors at Hour 3 (Khanna et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2017; 377:419–430).\n![alt  img12876764_1.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_1.jpg)\n ATHOS-3 Study Design(1)\n \n \nMAP=mean arterial pressure\n (1)Khanna et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2017; 377:419–430\n (2)Standard-of-care vasopressors included norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin\n \n\nGIAPREZA significantly improved blood pressure response. Specifically, the primary endpoint was achieved by 70% of GIAPREZA-treated patients compared to 23% of placebo-treated patients (p <0.0001).\n \n![alt  img12876764_2.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_2.jpg)\nATHOS-3 Primary Endpoint Results\n \n \n(1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)MAP response of 75 mm Hg or higher or an increase from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg at Hour 3 without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors\n \nGIAPREZA provides the ability to rapidly achieve and adjust therapeutic response. GIAPREZA rapidly increased MAP with a median time to MAP response of approximately 5 minutes. The plasma half-life of GIAPREZA is less than 1 minute.\n \n\nIn addition, a positive survival trend was observed. Mortality through Day 28 was 46% on GIAPREZA and 54% on placebo (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.57–1.07).\n \n![alt  img12876764_3.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_3.jpg)\n![alt  img12876764_4.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_4.jpg)\nPositive Survival Trend Observed (N=321)(1),(2)\n \n \n(1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)Khanna et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2017; 377:419–430\n (3)Patients were treated with either GIAPREZA or placebo, both in addition to background vasopressor therapy\n \nThe most common adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 10% of GIAPREZA-treated patients were thromboembolic events.\n \nAdverse Reactions Occurring in ≥4% of Patients Treated with GIAPREZA and ≥1.5% More Often than in Placebo-treated Patients(1)\n \n \n(1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)Including arterial and venous thrombotic events\n\n\n\nXERAVA® (eravacycline)\n XERAVA® (eravacycline) for injection is approved by the U.S. FDA and Singapore Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) as a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of cIAI due to susceptible microorganisms in patients 18 years of age and older. XERAVA is approved by the EC, MHRA, and the Hong Kong Department of Health (“DoH”) for the treatment of cIAI in adults. XERAVA is marketed in the U.S. by our wholly owned subsidiary, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Tetraphase”), and is marketed in Europe and Great Britain by PAION on behalf of Tetraphase and is marketed in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Singapore, the Malaysian Federation, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of Indonesia, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of the Philippines by Everest Medicines Limited (“Everest”).\n\ncIAIs are the second most common source of severe sepsis in the ICU cIAIs are defined as consequences of perforations of the gastrointestinal tract that result in contamination of the peritoneal space. In July 2024, XERAVA® was named as a recommended agent for empiric therapy in the updated 2024 SIS treatment guidelines for the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections. SIS also recommended XERAVA® be reserved for high-risk patients.\n\nInvestigating Gram-negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline (“IGNITE”)\n XERAVA was approved by the U.S. FDA, HSA, EC, MHRA, and DoH based on the results of IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, which were published in JAMA Surgery in March 2017 and Clinical Infectious Diseases in December 2018, respectively.\n \nIGNITE1 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 538 patients with clinical evidence of cIAIs requiring urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention who received either XERAVA or ertapenem. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection, at the test of cure (“TOC”) visit. The TOC visit was conducted 25 to 31 calendar days after the first dose of the study drug was administered.\n \nIGNITE4 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active controlled study in 499 patients with clinical evidence of cIAIs requiring urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention who received either XERAVA or meropenem. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection, at the TOC visit. The TOC visit was conducted 25 to 31 calendar days after the first dose of the study drug was administered.\n \n\n![alt  img12876764_5.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_5.jpg)\nIGNITE1 and IGNITE4 Study Design\n \n \n(1)Solomkin et al, JAMA Surgery 2017; 152(3):224-232\n (2)Solomkin et al, Clinical Infectious Diseases 2018; 69(6):921-9\n (3)TOC visit was conducted 25 to 31 calendar days after the first dose of the study drug was administered\n \nXERAVA demonstrated statistical noninferiority in clinical cure rate in the micro-ITT population, which included all randomized subjects who had baseline bacterial pathogens that caused cIAIs and against at least one of which the investigational drug has in vitro (in a test tube) antibacterial activity (N=846).\n![alt  img12876764_6.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_6.jpg)\n![alt  img12876764_7.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_7.jpg)\nIGNITE1 and IGNITE4 Primary Endpoint Results(1)\n \n \n(1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)Noninferiority margins of 10% and 12.5% were used for IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, respectively\n \n\nClinical cure rates across patients with gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens, including those with resistant strains, are shown in the following tables.\n \nClinical Cure Rates at TOC by Selected Baseline Pathogens in the Micro-ITT Population(1)\n \n \nN=Number of subjects in the micro-ITT Population; N1=Number of subjects with a specific pathogen; n=Number of subjects with a clinical cure at the TOC visit\n (1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)Comparators included ertapenem and meropenem for IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, respectively\n (3)Includes Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius\n (4)Includes Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, and Parabacteroides distasonis\n \nThe most common adverse reactions that were reported in XERAVA-treated patients in IGNITE1 and IGNITE4 were infusion site reactions.\n![alt  img12876764_8.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_8.jpg)\n Selected Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥1% of Patients Receiving XERAVA(1)\n \n \n(1)Charts, graphs and tables derived from FDA prescribing information\n (2)Comparators included ertapenem and meropenem for IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, respectively\n (3)Infusion site reactions include: catheter/vessel puncture site pain, infusion site extravasation, infusion site hypoaesthesia, infusion/injection site phlebitis, infusion site thrombosis, injection site/vessel puncture site erythema, phlebitis, phlebitis superficial, thrombophlebitis, and vessel puncture site swelling\nXACDURO®\n XACDURO® (sulbactam for injection; durlobactam for injection), co-packaged for intravenous use (formerly known as sulbactam-durlobactam or SUL-DUR), was approved by the FDA on May 23, 2023, and we commenced U.S. commercial sales of XACDURO® in the third quarter of 2023. In May 2024, XACDURO® was approved in China by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for use in Chinese patients 18 years of age and older. XACDURO® is a novel IV antibiotic. The product is a combination of sulbactam, a β-lactam antibiotic, and durlobactam, a novel β-lactamase inhibitor (“BLI”) with broad spectrum β-lactamase coverage including Classes A, C and D, that was specifically developed for the treatment of a variety of serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. In July 2024, XACDURO® was named as the preferred agent for the treatment of Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections, in combination with a carbapenem, in the updated 2024 IDSA treatment guidance.\nAcinetobacter\n Acinetobacter is a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen that predominantly infects critically ill patients often resulting in severe pneumonia and bloodstream infections but also capable of infecting other body sites as well. Once thought to be mostly benign, Acinetobacter is now considered a global threat in the healthcare setting due in part to its ability to acquire multidrug resistance at rates not previously seen in other bacteria. In addition, Acinetobacter can remain viable for up to 100 days in dry conditions and easily spreads via air or water droplets, which explains why the pathogen can often be found in many locations in the intensive care unit, or ICU, including bedrails, bedside tables, monitors of mechanical ventilators, intravenous pumps, door handles, stethoscopes and many other locations. Of significant concern, one study reported greater than 98% of Acinetobacter isolates in an ICU from non-clinical sources, such as bedrails and door handles, were determined to be multidrug resistant.\n Pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter can have mortality rates up to 50%. Antibiotic-resistance rates of Acinetobacter to current standard-of-care treatments are some of the highest reported, between 30% and 50% in the United States and greater than 90% in parts of Europe and Asia. Acinetobacter resistance to β-lactams is primarily driven by the expression of Class D β-lactamases, often in combination with Class A and/or Class C β-lactamases. There are currently no effective antibiotics specifically indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. Durlobactam is the first clinical-stage BLI with sufficient broad-spectrum activity against class A, C, and D β-lactamases to potentially restore the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter.\n Sulbactam, the β-lactam antibiotic used in XACDURO has superior microbiological potency against Acinetobacter compared to other β-lactam antibiotics based on in vitro and in vivo analyses. Historically, physicians used sulbactam to successfully treat Acinetobacter infections before development of broad β-lactamase mediated resistance rendered sulbactam on its own largely ineffective. We believe our data demonstrates that combining durlobactam with sulbactam can effectively restore the activity of sulbactam against multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter.\nAcinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin (“ATTACK”)\n We completed ATTACK, a Phase 3 registration trial of XACDURO for the treatment of patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections, with positive top-line data announced in October 2021 and published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in May 2023. ATTACK enrolled 207 patients at 95 clinical sites in 16 countries. This was a two-part trial with Part A being the randomized, comparative portion (XACDURO vs colistin) in patients with documented Acinetobacter hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VAPB), ventilated pneumonia (VP), or bacteremia, and Part B being an open-labeled portion including Acinetobacter infections resistant to, or having previously failed colistin or polymyxin B treatment. Baseline Acinetobacter isolates tested were greater than 95% carbapenem resistant.\n XACDURO met the primary efficacy endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality compared to colistin in the CRABC m-MITT population of Part A. XACDURO mortality was 19.0% (12/63) compared to 32.3% (20/62) in the colistin arm (treatment difference of -13.2%; 95% CI: -30.0, 3.5). Similar trends were demonstrated in 28-day and 14-day all-cause mortality favoring XACDURO across all study populations evaluated to date. A statistically significant difference in clinical cure at Test of Cure (TOC) was observed with 61.9% in the XACDURO arm compared to 40.3% in the colistin arm (95% CI 2.9-40.3). In Part B, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 17.9% (5/28) and consistent with that observed in Part A.\n\n\nSafety analyses from a total of 177 patients treated with XACDURO suggested that XACDURO was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to colistin. XACDURO met the primary safety objective with a statistically significant lower incidence of nephrotoxicity as measured by the RIFLE classification for acute kidney injury. XACDURO nephrotoxicity was 13.2% (12/91) versus 37.6% (32/85) in the colistin arm (p = 0. 0002). Overall adverse events (AEs) in the safety population were comparable between treatment groups with 87.9% (80/91) in the XACDURO arm vs. 94.2% (81/86) in the colistin arm in Part A, 89.3% (25/28) in Part B. Drug related AEs were 12.1% (10.7% in Part B) with XACDURO compared to 30.2% with colistin. The most common non-infectious AEs (≥10%) in the XACDURO arm were diarrhea (16.5%), allergic and hypersensitivity reactions (16.5%), anemia (13.2%) and hypokalemia (12.1%) in Part A. These AEs were also >10% in the colistin arm as was acute kidney injury.\n ![alt  img12876764_9.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_9.jpg)\nATTACK Study Design\n  \nIMI=Imipenem; TOC=Test of cure; HABP=hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia; VABP=ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia; VP=ventilated pneumonia; BSI=blood stream infection; ABC=Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex\n (1)2-part study, Part A being the randomized, controlled portion of the study in patients with ABC HABP / VABP or bacteremia.

ZEVTERA® is also approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP, excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients 18 years of age and older.\n![alt  img12876764_14.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_14.jpg)\n![alt  img12876764_15.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_15.jpg)\n![alt  img12876764_16.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_16.jpg)\n\n\nOn December 14, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an exclusive distribution and license agreement with Basilea, for the commercialization of ZEVTERA® in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we were granted exclusive marketing rights to ZEVTERA® in the U.S. in exchange for Basilea receiving a $4.0 million upfront payment in addition to tiered royalties and milestones on net sales in the U.S. if certain targets are met. We anticipate commercializing ZEVTERA® in mid-year 2025.\n The efficacy of ZEVTERA® in the treatment of adult patients with SAB, including right-sided infective endocarditis, was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter trial (NCT03138733). In this trial, adult patients were randomized to either ZEVTERA® 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 6 hours from study Day 1 to Day 8, and 667 mg IV every 8 hours from study Day 9 onwards) or daptomycin (6 mg/kg up to 10 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) plus optional aztreonam for coverage of gram-negative co-infections (the comparator).\nThe primary efficacy outcome in the study was overall success at the post-treatment evaluation (PTE) visit at 70 days post-randomization in the mITT population, as assessed by the independent DRC. Overall success rates at the PTE visit in the mITT population were 69.8% (132/189) in patients treated with ZEVTERA® and 68.7% (136/198) in patients treated with the comparator.\n \n \nThe efficacy of ZEVTERA® in the treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter trial (NCT03137173). Patients were randomized to either ZEVTERA® 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours or vancomycin plus aztreonam (vancomycin 1 gram or 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours, aztreonam 1 gram IV every 12 hours). Randomization was stratified by study site and type of ABSSSI. Treatment duration was 5 to 14 days. Patients could receive concomitant metronidazole for suspected anaerobic infection. A switch to oral therapy was not allowed.\nThe primary endpoint, assessed in the ITT population, was early clinical response 48–72 hours after start of treatment. Early clinical response required a reduction of the primary skin lesion by at least 20%, survival for at least 72 hours, and the absence of concomitant antibacterial treatment or additional unplanned surgery.\nThe primary and main secondary outcomes are shown below:\n  \n\nThe efficacy of ZEVTERA® in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA® 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.\n The results for clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit at Day 7 to 14 after end of treatment are shown below:\n  Competition\n GIAPREZA® competes with catecholamines (primarily norepinephrine), which are available as generics and inexpensive and typically used first line to treat distributive shock, and vasopressin, including Vasostrict® (Endo International plc) and vasopressin generic drugs, which are typically used hsecond line. In the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, GIAPREZA® demonstrated clinical benefit in patients who were not adequately responding to available vasopressors, including catecholamines and vasopressin. GIAPREZA®’s principal competition as a treatment in patients not adequately responding to available vasopressors is the use of these same vasopressors at increased doses. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA® will be limited, and our business may suffer.\n XERAVA® competes with a number of antibiotics that are currently marketed for the treatment of cIAI and other multidrug resistant infections, including: AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam, marketed by AbbVie Inc.); MERREM IV® (meropenem, marketed by AstraZeneca PLC); PRIMAXIN® (imipenem and cilastatin, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); RECARBRIO™ (imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); TYGACIL® (tigecycline, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); VABOMERE™ (meropenem and vaborbactam, marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.); ZERBAXA® (ceftolozane and tazobactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); ZOSYN® (piperacillin and tazobactam, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); and current and future generic versions of marketed antibiotics. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for XERAVA® will be limited, and our business may suffer.\n XACDURO® competes with a number of antibiotics that are used to treat carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections in the absence of other products indicated for these infections, including: FETROJA® (cefiderocol, marketed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), UNASYN® (ampicillin and sulbactam, marketed by Pfizer Inc.), colistin (polymyxin E), and other current and future generic versions of marketed antibiotics. There are at least two additional early-stage clinical programs developing investigational therapies for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for XACDURO® will be limited, and our business may suffer.\n ZEVTERA® competes with a wide range of generic and branded antibiotics that are used to treat the various infection types for which it is indicated, including: vancomycin, daptomycin, TEFLARO® (ceftaroline, marketed by Allergan Sales, LLC). If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for ZEVTERA® will be limited, and our business may suffer.\nRegulatory Exclusivity\n GIAPREZA®, XERAVA® and XACDURO® are New Chemical Entities (“NCEs”) approved by the U.S. FDA. In the U.S., NCEs approved by the FDA are eligible for market exclusivity under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which can prevent the approval of generic versions of the NCE for 5 to 7.5 years from the date of the initial approval of the NCE. Specifically, the FDCA provides a 5-year period of marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the applicant that gains approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all of the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted 4 years after the NDA approval of the NCE if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. Should the NDA holder commence litigation against the ANDA filer within 45 days of receipt of the certification notice, an automatic stay of the approval of any generic competition goes into effect until the earlier of: (i) 30 months from the receipt of the certification; or (ii) a court ruling of patent invalidity or non-infringement for the relevant patents. In the absence of a court ruling, the 30-month stay will be extended by such amount of time (if any) that is required for 7.5 years to have elapsed from the date of NDA approval of the NCE.\n ZEVTERA® was provided ten years of market exclusivity by the FDA from the date of its approval in April 2024.\nOn February 15, 2022, La Jolla received a paragraph IV notice of certification (the “Notice Letter”) from Gland Pharma Limited (“Gland”) advising that Gland had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of GIAPREZA® in the U.S. prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent Nos.: 9,220,745; 9,572,856; 9,867,863; 10,028,995; 10,335,451; 10,493,124; 10,500,247; 10,548,943; 11,096,983; and 11,219,662 (the “GIAPREZA® Patents”), which are listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”). The Notice Letter alleges that the GIAPREZA® Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Gland’s ANDA.\nOn March 29, 2022, La Jolla filed a complaint for patent infringement of the GIAPREZA® Patents against Gland and certain related entities in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to Gland’s ANDA filing. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, because GIAPREZA® is a new chemical entity and La Jolla filed a complaint for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of the Notice Letter, the FDA cannot approve Gland’s ANDA any earlier than 7.5 years from the approval of the GIAPREZA® NDA unless the District Court finds that all of the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed.\nOn February 22, 2023, La Jolla received a paragraph IV notice of certification (the “Second Notice Letter”) from Gland advising that Gland had amended its ANDA filing to include a paragraph IV certification alleging that all claims of the newly-issued and Orange Book-listed U.S. Patent No. 11,559,559 (“the ’559 Patent”), which covers GIAPREZA®, are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed.\n On March 22, 2023, La Jolla filed a First Amended Complaint in this litigation adding Gland’s marketing and distribution partners for its ANDA angiotensin II product, Fresenius Kabi USA LLC and Fresenius Kabi SwissBiosim GmbH (collectively, the “Fresenius Kabi Defendants”), as co-defendants. On April 7, 2023, La Jolla filed a Second Amended Complaint in response to the Second Notice Letter, adding claims that the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or import of Gland’s ANDA angiotensin II product will infringe the ’559 Patent. On November 14, 2023, La Jolla filed a Third Amended Complaint adding additional infringement claims against the Fresenius Kabi Defendants.\nOn February 18, 2025, La Jolla, as well as The George Washington University (collectively, with the La Jolla entities, the “Plaintiffs”) entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Gland and the Fresenius Kabi Defendants (collectively, “Defendants”) resolving the Hatch-Waxman Act concerning Gland’s ANDA filing. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs granted Defendants a perpetual, royalty-free and fully paid-up, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right and license solely to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and/or distribute the product that is subject to Gland’s ANDA in the United States commencing in the early 2030s, subject to certain exceptions as is customary in these type of agreements.\nAs required by law, the settlement is subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\nUnder the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (“GAIN”) provisions of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), the FDA may designate a product as a qualified infectious disease product (“QIDP”). In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections. We obtained a QIDP designation for the IV formulation of XERAVA® for cIAI in July 2013. Upon approving an application for a QIDP, the FDA will extend by an additional 5 years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a 5-year exclusivity period awarded for an NCE. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded. XERAVA® has been awarded this 5-year exclusivity under FDASIA.\n ![alt  img12876764_17.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_17.jpg)\nOur Pipeline\n The following table summarizes the status of our primary product candidate:\n  \n(1)Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (“GARDP”) fully funded the Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development activities and has commercial rights in WHO defined low-income and specified middle-income countries. We have retained commercial rights in major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific\nZoliflodacin\n Zoliflodacin is a late-stage product candidate, a potential single oral dose cure for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by the bacterial pathogen N. gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is an area of significant medical need and zoliflodacin is the only novel single dose treatment in development that provides a potential monotherapy oral alternative to intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhea, including infections caused by drug-resistant strains. Zoliflodacin targets the validated mechanism of action of the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics but does so in a novel manner to avoid existing fluoroquinolone resistance. In November 2023, we reported positive top-line data results of a pivotal Phase 3 trial. The study demonstrated statistical non-inferiority of microbiological cure at the urogenital site when compared to treatment with intramuscular infection of ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin, a current global standard of care regimen. We continue to advance zoliflodacin following its successful Phase 3 clinical trial results and expect to submit an NDA to the U.S. FDA in early 2025. This trial was initiated in 2019 in collaboration with GARDP, who funded all the Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs and in return received commercial rights for zoliflodacin in WHO-defined low-income and select middle-income countries. We retained commercial rights in all other countries, including the major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nGonorrhea\n Uncomplicated gonorrhea is an N. gonorrhoeae infection of the urethra, cervix, pharynx or rectum, and is more common than complicated gonorrhea, which includes spread of the infection to other tissues and potentially the bloodstream. Gonorrhea can be associated with serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, as well as an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Despite the continued use of effective antibiotics, it remains one of the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infections in the world with an estimated 82 million people worldwide infected each year, including over 1 million people each year in the United States. The occasional absence of symptoms, more frequent in women, is thought to be one reason for sustained levels of infection. Antibiotics remain the mainstay for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by N. gonorrhoeae.\n\nN. gonorrhoeae is the bacterial pathogen responsible for gonorrhea and has a strong propensity for uptake of chromosomal DNA from other genera of Neisseria which allows the bacteria to accumulate many mutations in chromosomal genes leading to frequent resistance of antibiotics. For example, penicillin was introduced for N. gonorrhoeae infections in 1943, and initial resistance was reported in 1945. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were first used to treat gonorrhea in 1949 and have been one of the most successful classes of antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae, but even so resistance was identified in 1969. One member of this class, ciprofloxacin, was introduced in 1980 and resistance was identified in 1990. More recently cephalosporin antibiotics, notably cefixime, had been widely used for the treatment of gonorrhea due to their oral administration along with a favorable efficacy and safety profile, although resistance by N. gonorrhoeae has been reported since 2007. As widespread use of these antibiotics drove the emergence of drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains, treatment guidelines have subsequently been amended. Ceftriaxone is currently the only CDC-recommended option for the treatment of gonorrhea and, until recently, was administered with azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, to provide coverage against other sexually transmitted diseases that tend to occur concurrently with gonorrhea. However, rising resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to azithromycin recently prompted the CDC to now recommend 500mg ceftriaxone monotherapy. Ceftriaxone is administered by intramuscular injection, which can be painful and may require patient monitoring by a healthcare administrator. Although ceftriaxone remains effective in most of the U.S., in Hawaii and Massachusetts as well as in several countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, France and Spain, N. gonorrhoeae strains with resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone have been reported, prompting concerns that multidrug-resistant gonorrhea may become a major community health issue.\n Market Opportunity\n N. gonorrhoeae is an immediate global public health threat with 82.4 million cases worldwide in 2020 (WHO estimate). Cases of gonorrhea in the United States have reached an estimated 1.6 million per year. The CDC estimates that the cases of gonorrhea in the United States have been increasing at least 10% per year since 2009.\nThe results of a 2017-2018 survey of countries reporting decreased susceptibility, DS, or resistance, R, of N. gonorrhoeae to current antibiotics are reflected in the table below.\n![alt  img12876764_18.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_18.jpg)\n  Historically, to reduce the risk of spreading drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, the CDC has changed treatment guidelines when resistance rates to recommended first-line treatments reach 5%. Since 2015, there has only been one recommended treatment on CDC guidelines for gonorrhea: 250mg intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone plus 1g of oral azithromycin. In 2020 the CDC once again updated its treatment guideline, now recommending a 500mg intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. This follows a 2019 update in the United Kingdom where recommended empirical treatment of gonorrhea is now 1g intramuscular ceftriaxone monotherapy.\nWe believe that as resistance to ceftriaxone continues to grow both in the US and around the world, there is an increasing unmet medical need for drugs effective against resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae and also for an oral therapy for those patients who cannot get an in-office intramuscular injection or prefer a more convenient option.\n Completed Clinical Trials\n Phase 3 registrational trial: We completed a global, multi-center Phase 3 registrational trial in collaboration with GARDP who conducted and funded all Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs. The Phase 3 trial enrolled a total of 930 patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea, including women, adolescents, and people living with HIV, making it the largest clinical trial ever conducted for a new treatment against gonorrhea infection, with 16 trial sites in regions with a high prevalence of gonorrhea across five countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand, and the U.S. The trial compared a single, oral, 3g dose of zoliflodacin to a globally recognized standard of care regimen (500mg ceftriaxone IM plus 1g oral azithromycin) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.\n![alt  img12876764_19.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_19.jpg)\n![alt  img12876764_21.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080014/000095017025027864/img12876764_21.jpg)\n\n\nZoliflodacin met the prespecified statistical test for non-inferiority when compared to ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin (5.31% (95%CI 1.38, 8.65%)). Non inferiority of zoliflodacin was demonstrated within the pre-specified margin of 12% and, furthermore, within the margin of 10% as specified in U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance.\nPhase 3 trial design\n \nTOC=Test of Cure; IM=intra-muscular; CRO-AZI=ceftriaxone and azithromycin\n \nEfficacy and safety results from Phase 3 trial(1)\n \n\nTEAE=Treatment emergent adverse event; CRO-AZI=ceftriaxone and azithromycin\n (1)Company data, published on November 6, 2023\n \nPhase 2 clinical proof-of-concept trial: We have completed a multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial comparing a single oral dose of 2.0g or 3.0g of zoliflodacin to 500mg intramuscular ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. In this trial, 179 randomized patients received treatment and zoliflodacin was generally well tolerated, with efficacy outcomes comparable to ceftriaxone. Microbiological eradication and clinical cure in urogenital infections with a single dose of zoliflodacin, the primary endpoint of the trial, was comparable to ceftriaxone, with 100% cure rate in both the 3.0g zoliflodacin and ceftriaxone groups in the per-protocol population. The results of this clinical trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2018.\n\n\nPhase 1 clinical trial: We evaluated zoliflodacin in two Phase 1 clinical trials studying 72 healthy volunteers in total. In one trial, we evaluated PKs and tolerability in 48 subjects and food effects in 18 subjects, and in the second trial, we evaluated absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in six subjects. Zoliflodacin was generally well tolerated in these trials at doses we would expect to be clinically active for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea. Administration of a high-fat meal was associated with an increase in zoliflodacin plasma concentration, suggesting that zoliflodacin could be administered with or without food.\n Preclinical Data\n We have generated biochemical, microbiological and in vivo data on zoliflodacin. The data suggest that zoliflodacin retains potent activity against contemporary clinical isolates in the U.S., Europe, China, Thailand and South Africa that are resistant to other antibiotic classes including fluroquinolones, which was expected given its novel mechanism of action. In addition, the data show significant resistance against two of the four standard antibiotics indicated for gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, and azithromycin, a macrolide.\nCompetition\n We are initially developing zoliflodacin as a single oral dose treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is commonly treated with 500mg intramuscular ceftriaxone, a generically available agent. Additional generic cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are also prescribed but not recommended as primary treatment options given current resistance rates. Gepotidacin, currently under development for a variety of infections by GlaxoSmithKline plc, is the only potentially competitive product candidate in late-stage clinical development that we are aware of that is being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. A Phase 3 clinical trial (EAGLE-1) was initiated by GlaxoSmithKline in October 2019. A prior Phase 2 clinical trial revealed the emergence of resistance to gepotidacin in 2 urogenital microbiological failures following administration of a single oral dose. In an attempt to overcome this resistance, gepotidacin will be given in two oral doses in the EAGLE-1 clinical trial; a 4-tablet 3000 milligram (mg) oral dose at the study site followed by another 4-tablet 3000mg oral dose as an outpatient.\nManufacturing\n Manufacturing of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® (FF/VI) and ANORO® ELLIPTA® (UMEC/VI) is performed by GSK.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce GIAPREZA®, XERAVA®, and XACDURO® and expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future to meet our development and commercial needs. In all of our manufacturing agreements, we require that contract manufacturers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) and drug products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers in order to protect our proprietary rights related to GIAPREZA®, XERAVA® and XACDURO®. The long-term commercial success of GIAPREZA®, XERAVA® and XACDURO® will depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers to supply cGMP-compliant API and drug product without interruption.\n We exclusively license ZEVTERA® (pre-packaging and labeling) from Basilea for the U.S. marketing rights. Our distribution and license agreement with Basilea requires that the drug product is manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. The long-term commercial success of ZEVTERA® will depend in part on the ability of Basilea to supply the drug product without interruption.\n With respect to our product candidates, we currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. Although we have contracts with these third parties to meet our current clinical supply needs, we do not have any current contractual relationships with these third parties for the manufacture of commercial supply of our product candidates after they are approved. As our product candidates approach potential approval by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing vendor relationships and processes.\n Government Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of our products and reimbursement. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nU.S. Government Regulation\n In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.\nApproval Processes\n In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:\n •refusal to approve pending applications;\n •withdrawal of an approval;\n •imposition of a clinical hold;\n •warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;\n •product seizures or recalls; or\n •total or partial suspension of production or distribution, or injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other \n The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;\n •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;\n •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices, or cGCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards and FDA requirements for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected;\n •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;\n •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity; and\n •FDA review and approval of the NDA.\n\n\nOnce a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical or nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include one or more protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.\n All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the informed consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n •Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as multidrug-resistant infections, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.\n •Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.\n •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.\n Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\n During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.\n The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for certain drugs and biologics. Specifically, PREA requires original NDAs, biologic license applications, or BLAs, and supplements thereto for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.\n\n\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.\nThe results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to completeness review before the FDA accepts it for filing.\n Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug that, if approved, would represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease or condition may receive priority review. Requests for priority review generally must be submitted at the time of NDA submission. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of new molecular entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider a major amendment to the application following the original submission.\n The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing complies with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendation.\n Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. In addition, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS (which may include requirements for, restricted distribution and use), enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval.\n On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the FDA ultimately decides that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval, the FDA will issue a complete response letter to indicate that the agency will not approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.\n\n\nExpedited Review and Approval\n The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and/or reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases with the potential, based on nonclinical or clinical data, to fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of treatment for a serious condition an expedited review within eight months from the completed submission (six months from filing) as compared to a standard review time of twelve months from the completed submission (10 months from filing) for a standard new molecular entity NDA. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.\n The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives for the development of new QIDPs. A new drug that is designated as a QIDP after a request by the sponsor that is made before an NDA is submitted will be eligible, if approved, for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have previously been eligible. In addition, a QIDP will receive priority review and qualify for a Fast Track designation. QIDPs are defined as antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen or qualifying pathogens identified by the FDA. XERAVA® and XACDURO® have been designated by the FDA as a QIDP. Zoliflodacin has also been designated as a QIDP by the FDA for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.\nPatent Term Restoration and Data Exclusivity\n Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. As noted above, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We have applied for restoration of patent term for one U.S. Patent covering XERAVA® and, in the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for other currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.\n  Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company using the drug entitled to data exclusivity as the reference listed drug, or RLD. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the use or conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other uses or conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies in support of its application or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\n In addition, as described above, under the GAIN Act a new drug that is designated as a QIDP is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain other exclusivity periods that the application may qualify for upon approval, specifically five-year exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and orphan exclusivity.\n\nPediatric Exclusivity\n The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to patent and exclusivity periods in effect at the time the pediatric exclusivity award is granted, if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. The FDA may request studies on approved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.\nPost-approval Requirements\n Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems, including safety issues, with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA and other authorities also strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. Under the FDCA the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including sanctions, civil and criminal fines and penalties, and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct.\n Moreover, any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:\n •record-keeping requirements;\n •reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;\n •providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;\n •drug sampling and distribution requirements;\n •notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;\n •complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and\n •complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.\n Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws.\n Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:\n •refusal to approve pending applications;\n •withdrawal of an approval;\n •imposition of a clinical hold;\n •warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;\n •product seizures or recalls;\n •total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or\n •injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and DOJ, or other governmental entities.\n\n\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\n Foreign Regulation\n In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\n Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under the centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, or under the purely national route of approval. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicines, and is optional for other medicines that are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states and, by extension (after national implementing measures), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In general, an initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure allows marketing authorization applications to be submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states, whereas the mutual recognition procedure must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state. Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures provide for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the “reference” member state.\n Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must approve the assessment report and related materials, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the concerned member states have the same 90-day period to recognize the marketing authorization in the reference member state. In either case, concerns about serious risks to public health escalate through the relevant EMA scientific committees, and the disputed points may eventually result in a consensus opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that is referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. The purely national procedure results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state.\n Following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020, and as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom and EU operate separate regulatory regimes. The UK and EU announced on December 24, 2020, that they had agreed a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, to govern their future relationship. The TCA remains provisional until formally ratified by the EU. The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and medical devices, which aims to ensure goods continue to flow between the EU and the UK and also has implications for product regulation and mutual recognition.\n As a result of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU, if a company wishes to sell its products in the United Kingdom, it will need to seek and maintain appropriate national marketing authorizations. The TCA does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of the regulatory regimes and so products exported from the UK to the EU must comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. In the pharmaceutical context, this has had a number of implications. From January 31, 2020, the UK no longer participated in EU institutions and their decision-making, including approval decisions under the centralized procedure. Moreover, the movement of finished pharmaceutical products into the EU from the UK is treated as an import from a third country. Since the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of batch testing and release, products must be quality control tested and released in the EU. However, the UK has unilaterally waived batch testing requirements for UK imports from the EU for products placed on the market prior to January 2023. It remains to be seen how these developments will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nReimbursement\n Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the approved products for a particular indication. For example, in the U.S. and most major foreign markets, drugs like GIAPREZA®, XERAVA® and XACDURO® that are administered in the hospital must be purchased by the hospital and generally are not reimbursed by third-party payors. Hospitals instead are reimbursed for patient cases based on patients’ diagnosed conditions under the U.S. Medicare diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) system or other like systems for non-Medicare patients in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Adoption of new drugs that are administered in the hospital generally occurs more slowly than adoption of new drugs that are taken on an outpatient basis, which generally are paid for by third-party payors.\n To secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\n Health Care Laws Governing Interactions with Healthcare Providers\n In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.\n The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescriptions, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim for payment for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\n Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, have also been alleged to violate false claims laws.\n\n\n The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal requirements that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.\n In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations promulgated by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on covered entities (i.e., certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HIPAA’s security standards apply directly to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA's civil and criminal penalties also directly apply to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\n What is more, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the children’s health insurance program (with certain exceptions) to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to covered recipients, including physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals’ covered recipients and information related to certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\n The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. In addition, some state laws require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing. Further, some state and local laws require the licensure of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n Finally, outside the United States, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (“GDPR”) contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information. The GDPR provides for potentially significant sanctions and contains extraterritoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. In addition, many countries around the world have enacted similar data privacy legislation. This legislation imposes increased compliance obligations and regulatory risk, including the potential for significant fines for noncompliance.\n Healthcare and Other Reform\n In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the first Trump administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the ACA for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. In December 2019, the federal appellate court upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which did not make a decision on the issue of severability as it determined the state attorney generals did not have standing.\n\n\nThere were other reform initiatives under the first Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70% starting in 2019. As another example, in 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the HHS, released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, has implemented others under its existing authority. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule through the CMS Innovation Center whereby Medicare Part B reimbursement for “certain high-cost prescriptions drugs” would be no more than most-favored-nation price (i.e., the lowest price) after adjustments, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, it is not yet clear what steps the Trump Administration will take or whether such steps will be successful.\n There have also been state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices and address price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nIn 2019, the DISARM Act of 2019 was introduced in Congress as new legislation to provide financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics. This new legislation was guided by input from the IDSA and will help to ensure that patients can access new antibiotics when they are clinically appropriate, require hospitals to establish antibiotic stewardship programs, and spur improved reporting of antibiotic use and resistance to more rapidly identify challenges and inform best practices. More recently, this legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in June 2021 which aims to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to encourage the development and use of DISARM antimicrobial drugs, and for other purposes.\n General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare, but not Medicaid, payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. There was a temporary suspension of the 2% reduction during the pandemic; that temporary suspension is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2021. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n Legislation was introduced to the U.S. Senate in September 2020 which aims to reinvigorate innovation for the development of new antibiotics through a subscription contract program managed by HHS. The PASTEUR Act was introduced to provide a mechanism for funding designated ‘critical need antimicrobial’ drugs post FDA approval. In return, patients covered by federal insurance programs will receive these drugs at no cost. These Contracts under the PASTEUR Act could range from $750 million to $3 billion in value. It is unclear when or if the PASTEUR Act or similar incentive programs will become law. In October 2021, the PACCARB authored a letter to the Honorable Xavier Becerra, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services recommending the passage of both DISARM and PASTEUR and the antimicrobial stewardship provisions contained within each act.\n Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.\n Other Laws and Regulations\n We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the Nasdaq Capital Market, on which our shares of common stock are traded. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.\nIntellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates, our core technologies, and other know-how. To accomplish this we rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. We file patent applications directed to our key product candidates to establish intellectual property positions. These patent applications are intended to protect new chemical entities relating to these product candidates as well as their manufacturing processes, intermediates and uses in the treatment of diseases.\n The intellectual property portfolios for our commercial products, advanced product candidates, and various compounds are summarized below.\n GIAPREZA®\n As of February 14, 2025, the licensed intellectual property portfolio relating to GIAPREZA® included 12 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 9 issued foreign patents and 13 pending foreign patent applications. The issued U.S. patents, and patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications, will expire between 2029 and 2034, absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term. The foreign patents, and patents that may issue from the pending foreign patent applications, will expire in 2034, absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term.\n As of February 14, 2025, the intellectual property portfolio relating to GIAPREZA® also included 4 issued U.S. patents, 7 pending U.S. patent applications, 8 issued foreign patents and 11 pending foreign patent applications.

Issued U.S. and foreign patents and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications have expiration dates of October 2029, January 2034 and May 2035.\n Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Know-How\n Our trademark portfolio currently consists of various registered trademark and service mark rights in several jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, Japan, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, Norway, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom, and pending applications in other jurisdictions. In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we routinely seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patents and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\n Our Strategic Partnership with Sarissa Capital\n Strategic Advisory Agreement\n On December 11, 2020, we entered into a Strategic Advisory Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Sarissa Capital Management LP (“Sarissa Capital”), pursuant to which Sarissa Capital provides a variety of strategic services to us in order to assist us in the development and execution of our acquisition strategy intended to diversify our assets and the potential sources of revenue. Sarissa Capital is considered to be a related party due to its investment in Innoviva and its representation on our board of directors.\nPartnership Agreement\n On December 11, 2020, Innoviva Strategic Partners LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Strategic Partners”), entered into a subscription agreement and an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the “Partnership Agreement”) pursuant to which Strategic Partners became a limited partner of ISP Fund LP (the “Partnership”). The general partner of the Partnership is an affiliate of Sarissa Capital and, pursuant to an investment management agreement, Sarissa Capital acts as the investment adviser to the Partnership. Strategic Partners made a $300 million initial contribution to the Partnership. The Partnership was formed for the purposes of investing in equity securities in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\n In May 2021, Strategic Partners received a distribution of $110.0 million from the Partnership to provide funding to us for a strategic repurchase of shares held by GSK. Pursuant to the letter agreement entered into between Strategic Partners, the Partnership, and Sarissa Capital Fund GP LP on May 20, 2021, Strategic Partners agreed to make additional capital contributions to the Partnership in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the May 2021 distribution prior to March 31, 2022. A $110.0 million contribution was made during the first quarter of 2022.\n 36\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2024, we made an election to unwind the capital accounts in the Partnership in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement and we expect to receive distributions of our capital accounts through April 2026.\nHuman Capital\n As of December 31, 2024, we had 127 employees, all of whom were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also hire consultants and contract with third parties, as needed, to provide additional resources to support our business activities.\n Our key human capital management objectives are to identify, recruit, integrate, retain and motivate our new and existing employees. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. Employees receive an annual base salary and are eligible to earn performance-based cash bonuses. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the physical and mental health and wellness of all of our employees and their families and flexible working arrangements. Additionally, we grant equity awards in order to allow employees to share in the performance of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer regularly updates our board of directors and our committees on the operation and status of these human capital trends and activities.\n We have created an environment that fosters individual development while maintaining consistency in our corporate values and code of conduct. We offer seminars from external resources and promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people in our workplace.\n The management team and Board of Directors are keenly aware of the importance of the Company’s need to conduct business with high standards. Our mission as an organization is to be patient-centric and develop innovative treatments to find solutions for patients suffering from rare and underserved diseases.\nOur employees, partners, and investors expect us to honor our values and take action to promote a more equitable and sustainable world for future generations.\n As we further build our organization behind our portfolio of royalties and innovative healthcare assets, we intend to strive to understand the perspectives of the clients and communities we will serve, and as such, we are intensifying our efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout our organization. We will strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and policies concerning environmental protection in all our business activities and in the selection of partners we choose to work with. We are committed to strengthening our local community by contributing through volunteerism and will continue, as we have been doing, to provide donations to parties we believe will support our goal of improving patient health and well-being. We are also committed to good corporate governance. All of our employees, officers and directors must conduct themselves according to the language and spirit of our Code of Conduct, and our Board of Directors is dedicated to providing effective corporate oversight including through oversight committees such as the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. As our Company grows, we will continue to integrate policies and programs that further foster this effort.\n Health, Safety and Wellness\n We strive to provide pay, benefits and other employee services that are competitive to market in the life sciences industry and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, stock options and restrictive stock units, bonuses, employee spot awards, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. We utilize third party consultants to review and update our compensation practices annually.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\n The Company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and access to liquidity materially. The Company’s business is subject to uncertainties and risks including:\n •RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® face substantial competition for their intended uses in the targeted markets from products discovered, developed, launched and commercialized both by GSK and by other pharmaceutical companies, which could cause the royalties payable to us pursuant to the GSK Agreements to be less than expected, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n •We are dependent on GSK for the successful commercialization and development of the products developed under the GSK Agreements. If GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization and development of these products, is unsuccessful in its efforts, or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business would be materially harmed.\n •Our debt including our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior notes are senior in capital structure and cash flow, respectively, to our common stockholders. Satisfying the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect our liquidity or the amount or timing of potential distributions to our stockholders.\n •GSK has indicated to us that it believes its consent may be required before we can engage in certain royalty monetization transactions with third parties, which may inhibit our ability to engage in these transactions.\n\n\n•If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of that product candidate.\n \n•We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of both our product and commercial candidates, and we may seek additional collaborations in the future. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product or commercial candidates.\n •Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, such product candidate may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n •Our operations could be disrupted by failure of our information systems or cyber-attacks.\n •If we engage in future acquisitions or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\n •Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any future collaborators from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which territories, we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product candidate.\n \nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\n Currently, we derive most of our revenues from GSK and our near-term success depends in large part on GSK’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize the products in the respiratory programs partnered with GSK.\n Pursuant to the GSK Agreements, GSK is responsible for the development and commercialization of products in the partnered respiratory programs. Royalty revenues from RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® are expected to represent the majority of our foreseeable future revenues from GSK. The amount and timing of revenue from such royalties are unknown and highly uncertain. Our near-term success depends in large part upon the performance by GSK of its commercial obligations under the GSK Agreements and the commercial success of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®. We have no control over GSK’s marketing and sales efforts, and GSK might not be successful, which would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n Our quarterly royalty revenues may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The amount of royalties and milestone payments, if any, we receive will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n •the extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support GSK provides to our partnered products;\n •market acceptance and demand for our partnered products;\n •changes in the treatment paradigm or standard of care for COPD or asthma, for instance through changes to the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines;\n •the competitive landscape of generic and branded products and developing therapies that compete with our products owned by GSK (such as Advair®) but which are not partnered with us and pricing pressure in the respiratory markets targeted by our partnered products;\n •the size of the market for our partnered products;\n •the mix of sales of our partnered products;\n •decisions as to the timing of product launches, pricing and discounts;\n •reprioritization of GSK’s commercial efforts on other products owned by GSK, which are not partnered with us;\n\n\n•GSK’s ability to expand the indications for which our partnered products can be marketed;\n •a satisfactory efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in a broad patient population;\n •acceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our partnered products by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors;\n •timing and amounts of payor rebate adjustments and prior period rebate adjustments;\n •seasonal fluctuations of demand;\n •the ability of patients to be able to afford our partnered products or obtain health care coverage that covers our partnered products;\n •safety concerns in the marketplace for respiratory therapies in general and with our partnered products in particular;\n •regulatory developments relating to the manufacture or continued use of our partnered products;\n •the requirement to conduct additional post‑approval studies or trials for our partnered products;\n •GSK’s ability to obtain regulatory approval of our partnered products in additional countries;\n •the unfavorable outcome of any potential litigation relating to our partnered products;\n •general economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our partnered products are sold, including microeconomic disruptions or slowdowns; or\n •if our royalty revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\n When the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products, including but not limited to generic forms of Advair, that compete with RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® or a generic form of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, the royalties payable to us pursuant to the GSK Agreements will be less than anticipated, which in turn would harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\nOnce an NDA or marketing authorization application outside the United States is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a “listed drug” that can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA in the United States. Agency regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes in the United States and in nearly every pharmaceutical market around the world. Numerous companies have brought to market generic forms of the ICS/LABA drug Advair® since certain patents covering the Advair® delivery device expired in 2016. In general, these manufactures are required to conduct a number of clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetic and device studies to demonstrate equivalence to Advair, per FDA’s September 2013 draft guidance document. These studies are designed to demonstrate that the generic product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, exposure and clinical efficacy as the branded product. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same exacting quality standards as branded products, may be significantly less costly to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product and products that may compete with such branded product is typically lost to the generic product.\n In January 2019, Mylan announced that the FDA approved Wixela™ Inhu™ (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, USP), the first generic of ADVAIR DISKUS®. In that same month, Teva announced that the FDA approved two of their products for adolescent and adult patients with asthma, one of which is AirDuo™ RespiClick® (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder), a non-AB substitutable generic version of Advair®. In January 2020, Astra Zeneca launched an authorized generic version of Symbicort. In December 2020, Hikma/Vectura announced that it received FDA approval and launched its generic version of GSK’s Advair Diskus®.\n\n\nIn April 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance documents covering Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Trifenatate (FF/VI), the active ingredients used in RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®. Introduction of generic products that compete against ICS/LABA products, like RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, would materially adversely impact our future royalty revenue, profitability and cash flows. We cannot yet ascertain what impact these generic products and any future approved generic products will have on any sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® or ANORO® ELLIPTA®, if approved.\n Reduced prices and reimbursement rates due to the actions of governments, payors, or competition or other healthcare cost containment initiatives such as restrictions on use, may negatively impact royalties generated under the GSK Agreements.\n The continuing efforts of governments, pharmaceutical benefit management organizations (“PBMs”), insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care has adversely affected the price, market access, and total revenues of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® and may continue to adversely affect them in the future. These organizations, together with governments, have increasingly imposed utilization management tools favoring the use of generic products. As these practices expand, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competitive activity, which has resulted in lower overall prices for our products.\n The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, “PPACA”) and other legislative or regulatory requirements or potential legislative or regulatory actions regarding healthcare and insurance matters, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., could adversely influence the purchase of healthcare products and reduce demand and prices for our partnered products. This could harm GSK’s ability to market our partnered products and significantly reduce future revenues. For example, when GSK launched RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® for the treatment of COPD in the U.S. in October 2013, GSK experienced significant challenges gaining coverage at some of the largest PBMs, healthcare payors, and providers and lower overall prices than expected. Recent actions by U.S. PBMs in particular have increased discount levels for respiratory products resulting in lower net sales pricing realized for products in our collaboration. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures will continue and may increase. This may make it difficult for GSK to sell our partnered products at a price acceptable to us or GSK or to generate revenues in line with our analysts’ or investors’ expectations, which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nMore recently, the presidential administration and the U.S. Congress have and may continue to take actions in an effort to modify or replace PPACA and to implement or pass other reforms to the healthcare system, including proposed legislation related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals. There is uncertainty with respect to any potential changes that may be proposed and what the impact, if any, will be on our business, including the impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by PPACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\n We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be considered and potentially adopted, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures and may adversely affect our operating results.\n A portion of our current revenues are from royalties derived from sales of our respiratory products partnered with GSK, RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®. If the treatment paradigm for the indications our partnered products are approved for change or if GSK is unable to, or does not devote sufficient resources to, maintain or continue increasing sales of these products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe currently depend, in part, on royalties from sales of our products partnered with GSK to support our existing operations. The treatment paradigm for COPD and asthma constantly evolves. For instance, in November 2018, the GOLD guidelines were revised to favorably position bronchodilator monotherapy and LABA/LAMA treatment ahead of ICS/LABA for the treatment of COPD unless the patient has frequent exacerbations, or an eosinophil count greater than 300 per cubic microliter. The use of ICS in COPD is also recommended for patients requiring triple therapy (LABA, LAMA, ICS). If the treatment paradigms were to change further, causing our partnered products to fall out of favor, or if GSK were unable, or did not devote sufficient resources, to maintain or continue increasing RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® sales, our results of operations would likely suffer, and the price of our securities could fall.\n\nIf the commercialization of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® in the countries in which they have received regulatory approval encounters any delays or adverse developments, or perceived delays or adverse developments, or if sales or payor coverage does not meet investors’, analysts’, or our expectations, our business will be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\n Under our agreements with our collaborative partner GSK, GSK has full responsibility for commercialization of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®. GSK has launched RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among others. The commercialization of the products in countries where they are already launched and the commercialization launch in new countries are still subject to fluctuating overall pricing levels and uncertain timeframes to obtain payor coverage. Any delays or adverse developments or perceived additional delays or adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® including if sales or payor coverage does not meet investors’, analysts’, or our expectations, would significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\n We are dependent on GSK for the successful commercialization and development of products under the GSK Agreements. If GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization or development of these products, is unsuccessful in its efforts, or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business would be materially harmed.\nGSK is responsible for all clinical and other product development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for products developed under the GSK Agreements, including RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®. Our royalty revenues under the GSK Agreements may not meet our, analysts’, or investors’ expectations, due to a number of important factors. GSK has a substantial respiratory product portfolio in addition to the partnered products that are covered by the GSK Agreements. GSK may make respiratory product portfolio decisions or statements about its portfolio which may be, or may be perceived to be, harmful to the respiratory products partnered with us. For instance, GSK has wide discretion in determining the efforts and resources that it will apply to the development and commercialization of our partnered products. In addition, GSK may determine to focus its commercialization efforts on its own products. For example, in January 2015, GSK launched Incruse® (UMEC) in the U.S., which is a LAMA for the treatment of COPD. GSK may determine to focus its marketing efforts on Incruse, which could have the effect of decreasing the potential market share of ANORO® ELLIPTA® and lowering the royalties we may receive for such product. Alternatively, GSK may decide to market to eventually compete directly against sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®. In the event GSK does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our partnered products or chooses to reprioritize its commercial programs, our business, operations and stock price would be negatively affected.\nAny adverse change in FDA policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma could significantly harm our royalty revenues and the price of our securities could fall.\n On February 18, 2010, the FDA announced that LABAs should not be used alone in the treatment of asthma and it will require manufacturers to include this warning in the product labels of these drugs, along with taking other steps to reduce the overall use of these medicines. The FDA now requires that the product labels for LABA medicines reflect, among other things, that the use of LABAs is contraindicated without the use of an asthma controller medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid, that LABAs should only be used long term in patients whose asthma cannot be adequately controlled on asthma controller medications, and that LABAs should be used for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved. In addition, in March 2010, the FDA held an Advisory Committee to discuss the design of medical research studies (known as “clinical trial design”) to evaluate serious asthma outcomes (such as hospitalizations, a procedure using a breathing tube known as intubation, or death) with the use of LABAs in the treatment of asthma in adults, adolescents, and children. Further, in April 2011, the FDA announced that to further evaluate the safety of LABAs, it required the manufacturers of currently marketed LABAs to conduct additional randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trials comparing the addition of LABAs to inhaled corticosteroids versus inhaled corticosteroids alone. These post‑marketing studies have been completed and the FDA stated that treating asthma with LABAs in combination with ICS did not result in significantly more serious asthma-related side effects than treatment with ICS alone. The FDA subsequently removed the black box warning from the ICS/LABA package inserts. Although this concern appears to be resolved, it is unknown at this time what, if any, future concerns could impact the use of ICS/LABA and its potential impact on the prospects for FF/VI. Any adverse change in FDA policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma could significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\n\n\nAny adverse developments to the regulatory status of either RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® or ANORO® ELLIPTA® in the countries in which they have received regulatory approval, including labeling restrictions, safety findings, or any other limitation to usage, would harm our business and may cause the price of our securities to fall.\n Although RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® are approved and marketed in a number of countries, it is possible that adverse changes to the regulatory status of these products could occur in the event new safety issues are identified, treatment guidelines are changed, or new studies fail to demonstrate product benefits. A number of notable pharmaceutical products have experienced adverse developments during commercialization that have resulted in the product being withdrawn, approved uses being limited, or new warnings being included. In the event that any adverse regulatory changes were to occur to any of our products, our business would be harmed, and the price of our securities could fall.\n Any adverse developments or results or perceived adverse developments or results with respect to the ongoing studies for FF/VI in asthma or COPD, for UMEC/VI in COPD, or any future studies would significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall, and if regulatory authorities in those countries in which approval has not yet been granted determine that the ongoing studies for FF/VI in asthma or COPD or the ongoing studies for UMEC/VI for COPD do not demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy, the continued development of FF/VI or UMEC/VI or both could be significantly delayed, they might not be approved by these regulatory authorities, and even if approved they may be subject to restrictive labeling, any of which might harm our business, and the price of our securities could fall.\n Although we have announced the completion of, and reported certain top‑line data from, the Phase 3 registrational program for FF/VI in COPD and asthma, additional studies of FF/VI are underway or may commence in the future. Any adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to any prior, current or future studies in these programs could significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\n Although the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and Health Canada and other jurisdictions have approved ANORO® ELLIPTA®, it has not yet been approved in all jurisdictions.\n Any adverse developments or results or perceived adverse developments or results with respect to other pending or future regulatory submissions for the FF/VI program or the UMEC/VI program might significantly harm our business and the price of our securities could fall. Examples of such adverse developments include, but are not limited to:\n •not every study, nor every dose in every study, in the Phase 3 programs for FF/VI achieved its primary endpoint and regulatory authorities may determine that additional clinical studies are required;\n •safety, efficacy or other concerns arising from clinical or non‑clinical studies in these programs having to do with the LABA VI, which is a component of FF/VI and UMEC/VI;\n •analysts adjusting their sales forecasts downward from previous projections based on results or interpretations of results of prior, current or future studies;\n •safety, efficacy or other concerns arising from clinical or non‑clinical studies in these programs;\n •regulatory authorities determining that the Phase 3 programs in asthma or in COPD raise safety concerns or do not demonstrate adequate efficacy; or\n •any change in FDA (or comparable foreign regulatory agency) policy or guidance regarding the use of LABAs to treat asthma or the use of LABAs combined with a LAMA to treat COPD.\n\n\nRELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® face substantial competition for their intended uses in the targeted markets from products discovered, developed, launched and commercialized both by GSK and by other pharmaceutical companies, which could cause the royalties payable to us pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement to be less than expected, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n GSK has responsibility for obtaining regulatory approval, launching and commercializing RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® for their intended uses in the targeted markets around the world. While these products have received regulatory approval and have been launched and commercialized in the U.S. and certain other targeted markets, the products face substantial competition from existing products previously developed and commercialized both by GSK and by other competing pharmaceutical companies and can expect to face additional competition from new products that are discovered, developed and commercialized by the same pharmaceutical companies and other competitors going forward. For example, sales of generic Advair®, GSK’s approved medicine for both COPD and asthma, continue to have a negative impact on sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®.\n Many of the pharmaceutical companies competing in respiratory markets are international in scope with substantial financial, technical and personnel resources that permit them to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize new products in a highly efficient and low-cost manner at competitive prices to consumers. In addition, many of these competitors have substantial commercial infrastructure that facilitates commercializing their products in a highly efficient and low-cost manner at competitive prices to consumers. The market for products developed for treatment of COPD and asthma continues to experience significant innovation and reduced cost in bringing products to market over time. There can be no assurance that RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® will not be replaced by new products that are deemed more effective at lower cost to consumers. The ability of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, and ANORO® ELLIPTA® to succeed and achieve the anticipated level of sales depends on the commercial and development performance of GSK to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage over other products with the same intended use in the targeted markets.\n If sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA® are less than anticipated because of existing or future competition in the markets in which they are commercialized, including competition from existing and new products that are perceived as lower cost or more effective, our royalty payments could be less than anticipated, which in turn would harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n We may not be able to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards.\n We have net operating loss carryforwards and other significant U.S. tax attributes that we believe could offset otherwise taxable income in the U.S. The net operating loss carryforwards available in any year to offset our net taxable income will be reduced following a more than 50% change in ownership during any period of 36 consecutive months (an “ownership change”) as determined under the Code. Transactions involving our common stock, even those outside our control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. We have conducted an analysis to determine whether an ownership change had occurred since inception through December 31, 2024 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company did not experience an ownership change during the testing period. Subsequent changes in our ownership or sale of our stock could have the effect of limiting the use of our net operating losses in the future. There may be certain annual limitations for utilization based on the above-described ownership change provisions. In addition, we may not be able to have sufficient future taxable income prior to their expiration because certain net operating losses have carryforward periods. Future changes in federal and state tax laws pertaining to net operating loss carryforwards may also cause limitations or restrictions from us claiming such net operating losses. If the net operating loss carryforwards become unavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future taxable income will not be shielded from federal and state income taxation absent certain U.S. federal and state tax credits, and the funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes would be reduced.\n\n\nIf any product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK were not approved by regulatory authorities or are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans, our business would be adversely affected and the price of our securities could fall.\n The FDA must approve any new medicine before it can be marketed and sold in the U.S. Our partner GSK must provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with data from preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate that the product candidates are safe and effective for a defined indication before they can be approved for commercial distribution. GSK will not obtain this approval for a partnered product candidate unless and until the FDA approves an NDA. The processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the FDA to market and sell a new product are complex, require a number of years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. In order to market medicines in foreign countries, separate regulatory approvals must be obtained in each country. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Conversely, failure to obtain approval in one or more country may make approval in other countries more difficult.\n Clinical studies involving product candidates partnered with GSK may reveal that those candidates are ineffective, inferior to existing approved medicines, unacceptably toxic, or that they have other unacceptable side effects. In addition, the results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later‑stage clinical studies may not produce the same results as earlier‑stage clinical studies.\n Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early preclinical or clinical studies have subsequently suffered significant setbacks or failed in later clinical or non‑clinical studies. In addition, clinical and non‑clinical studies of potential products often reveal that it is not possible or practical to continue development efforts for these product candidates. If these studies are substantially delayed or fail to prove the safety and effectiveness of product candidates in development partnered with GSK, GSK may not receive regulatory approval for such product candidates and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed and the price of our securities might fall.\n Several well‑publicized Complete Response letters issued by the FDA and safety‑related product withdrawals, suspensions, post‑approval labeling revisions to include boxed warnings and changes in approved indications over the last several years, as well as growing public and governmental scrutiny of safety issues, have created a conservative regulatory environment. The implementation of new laws and regulations and revisions to FDA clinical trial design guidance have increased uncertainty regarding the approvability of a new drug. Further, there are additional requirements for approval of new drugs, including advisory committee meetings for new chemical entities, and formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy at the FDA’s discretion. These laws, regulations, additional requirements and changes in interpretation could cause non‑approval or further delays in the FDA’s review and approval of any product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK.\n Even if product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK receive regulatory approval, as is the case with RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA® and ANORO® ELLIPTA®, commercialization of such products may be adversely affected by regulatory actions and oversight.\n Even if GSK receives regulatory approval for product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK, this approval may include limitations on the indicated uses for which GSK can market the medicines or the patient population that may utilize the medicines, which may limit the market for the medicines or put GSK at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. These restrictions make it more difficult to market the approved products.\n For example, at the joint meeting of the Pulmonary‑Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA regarding the sNDA for BREO® ELLIPTA® as a treatment for asthma, the advisory committee recommended that a large LABA safety trial with BREO® ELLIPTA® should be required in adults and in children ages 12‑17, similar to the ongoing LABA safety trials being conducted as an FDA Post‑Marketing Requirement by each of the manufacturers of LABA containing asthma treatments. The FDA did not concur with the recommendation. A pediatric program including patients 5‑17 years of age is currently ongoing.\n\n\nIn addition, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the approved product remain subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. If we or GSK become aware of previously unknown problems with an approved product in the U.S. or overseas or at contract manufacturers’ facilities, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on the product, the contract manufacturers or on GSK, including requiring it to reformulate the product, conduct additional clinical studies, change the labeling of the product, withdraw the product from the market or require the contract manufacturer to implement changes to its facilities. GSK is also subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which any of the product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK are approved for commercialization. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including non‑clinical and clinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post‑market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion. Any failure to maintain regulatory approval would limit GSK’s ability to commercialize the product candidates in any respiratory program partnered with GSK, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition, and which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\n Pharmaceutical research and development are very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products.\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our product.\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discovery and development. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. New product candidates that appear promising in development or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of newer better, or more cost-effective competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiveness in reaching healthcare professionals, including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and development resources efficiently, fail to pursue or invest sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may have been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inventories, and other negative impacts. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of, or variability in demand for, new products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficult meeting product demand or, on the other hand, excess inventory and related financial charges.\n We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFailure to successfully develop and market new products in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.\n Acquisitions or strategic investments we have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful.\n As part of our strategy, we frequently monitor and analyze acquisition or investment opportunities that we believe will create value for our shareholders.\n Existing or future acquisitions and investments could involve numerous risks that may prevent us from fully realizing the benefits that we anticipated as a result of the transaction. These risks include the failure to derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectual property including as a result of the failure to obtain regulatory approval or to monetize products once approved, as well as risks from lengthy product development and high upfront development costs without guarantee of successful results. Patents and other intellectual property rights covering acquired technology and/or intellectual property may not be obtained, and if obtained, may not be sufficient to fully protect the technology or intellectual property. We may be subject to liabilities, including unanticipated litigation costs, that are not covered by indemnification protection we may obtain. As we pursue or consummate a strategic acquisition or investment, we may value the acquired or funded company incorrectly, fail to successfully manage our operations as our asset diversity increases, expend unforeseen costs during the acquisition or integration process, or encounter other unanticipated risks or challenges. Once an investment is made, we may fail to value it accurately, properly account for it in our consolidated financial statements, or successfully divest it or otherwise realize the value which we originally invested or have subsequently reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Any failure by us to effectively limit such risks as we implement our acquisitions or strategic investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may negatively impact our net income and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n We have a significant amount of debt including our convertible subordinated notes and convertible senior notes that are senior in capital structure and cash flow, respectively, to our common stockholders. Satisfying the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect our liquidity or the amount or timing of potential distributions to our stockholders.\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $453.5 million in total debt outstanding, comprised primarily of $192.5 million in principal outstanding under our convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and $261.0 million in principal outstanding under our convertible notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) (the 2025 Notes and 2028 Notes, hereinafter, the “Notes”). The Notes are unsecured debt and, with the exception of the 2028 Notes, are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date. Holders of the Notes may require us to purchase all or any portion of their Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any unpaid interest, upon a fundamental change. A fundamental change is generally defined to include a merger involving us, an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock. In addition, to the extent we pursue and complete a monetization transaction or a transaction that modifies our corporate structure, the structure of such transaction may qualify as a fundamental change under the Notes, which could trigger the put rights of the holders of the Notes, in which case we would be required to use a portion of the net proceeds from such transaction to repurchase any Notes put to us.\n Satisfying the obligations of this debt could adversely affect the amount or timing of any distributions to our stockholders. We may choose to satisfy, repurchase, or refinance this debt through public or private equity or debt financings if we deem such financings available on favorable terms. If any or all of the Notes are not converted into shares of our common stock before the maturity date, we will have to pay the holders the full aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Any of the above payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash position. If we fail to satisfy these obligations, it may result in a default under the indenture, which could result in a default under certain of our other debt instruments, if any. Any such default would harm our business and the price of our securities could fall.\n If we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to retain our key employees, our ability to manage our business may be impaired.\n Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of our management team, who have extensive experience and specialized expertise in our business. None of our employees have employment commitments for any fixed period of time and all may leave our employment at will. If we fail to retain our qualified personnel or to replace them when they leave, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, which may cause the price of our securities to fall.\n To continue to commercialize our products, and advance the research, development, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product candidates, we have expanded, and may need to further expand, our workforce. Our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future approved products, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\n\n\nUneven economic growth or downturns or international trade and other global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n Economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales. Declining tax revenues and increased government spending on other programs attributable to uneven economic growth or downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending, leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Also, if our customers, suppliers, or business partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or business partners. Similarly, uneven economic growth or downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.\n In addition, trade and other global disputes and interruptions, including related to tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments, international tension and conflicts, as well as cost inflation, strains on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, and public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, affect our ability to do business. For example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and inflation due, in part, to geopolitical and economic disruptions, has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers.\nIn addition to developments related to our business or financial results, or those of our competitors, uneven economic growth, downturns, or other negative global developments, could also undermine our growth or result in significant and sudden declines in the trading price of our common stock and market capitalization.\n In addition, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or partners. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n \nOur success in preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results in current or future clinical trials.\n Our success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Certain product candidates may fail to show the necessary safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials.\n  In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologic products proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections because of many factors, including to changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Any such delays could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of that product candidate.\n We, or our potential collaborators, may not commercialize, market, promote, or sell any product candidate without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority, and we may never receive such approvals. Even if our product candidates appear sufficiently effective and/or safe in patients in well-controlled clinical trials, it is impossible to predict if or when these product candidates will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\n  We may experience numerous unforeseen events prior to, during, or because of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including but not limited to:\n •the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority may change from the views they have expressed to us as to the design, implementation, and/or interpretation of our clinical trials;\n •the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program;\n •regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n •we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n •clinical trials of product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n •we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n •we may not be able to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner, if at all, for example because the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate;\n •enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate, or we may fail to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n •we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to them, to the FDA’s or other comparable regulatory authority’s, satisfaction;\n •third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n •regulators may issue a clinical hold, or regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n •the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n •the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\n\n•the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n •our product candidates, once exposed to greater numbers of patients, may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the clinical trials or cause regulatory authorities to refuse to approve our product candidates or approve them only with significant restrictions on distribution or use;\n •even if our clinical trials are successful, the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may determine that the overall risk-benefit profiles of our product candidates are insufficient to support marketing authorization; and\n •the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\n If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other testing of those product candidates, or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n •be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n •not obtain marketing approval at all;\n •obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n •obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, such as black box warnings or a REMS program;\n •be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n •be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\n Our product development costs may also increase if we experience delays in testing and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, delays of clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\n If we are not successful in discovering, developing, and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\n We have chosen to devote a substantial amount of our effort on the continued clinical testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. However, an element of our strategy may include the development of novel product candidates in other therapeutic areas. Our efforts to identify and develop product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n •the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n •competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n •product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;\n •a product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n •a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\n\n•a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable; and\n •the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not approve or agree with the intended use of a new product candidate.\n If we fail to develop and successfully generate revenue from other current and future product candidates, our future prospects may be harmed, and we will be more vulnerable to any problems that we or potential collaborators may encounter in developing and commercializing our current product candidates.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n We may not be able to initiate, continue or complete clinical trials of our product candidates that we develop if we and our collaborators are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authority. We have limited experience enrolling patients in our clinical trials and cannot predict how successful we will be in enrolling patients in future clinical trials.\n For instance, patients involved in our clinical trials are often in the hospital setting and the decision to participate can be made by the caregiver or doctor. Accordingly, seeking consent for patient participation may become difficult when the family and/or the patient may not be available to consider participation in a clinical trial and the providers/investigators seeking the consent often have no established relationship with the family or patient. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials to treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors. If we are not successful at enrolling patients in one clinical trial, it may affect when we are able to initiate the next clinical trial, which could result in significant delays in our efforts to pursue regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including but not limited to:\n •the size and nature of the patient population;\n •the severity of the disease under investigation;\n •the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n •the eligibility criteria for participation in the clinical trial;\n •the design of the clinical trial;\n •the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n •our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with appropriate experience;\n •the availability of drugs approved to treat the diseases under study;\n •the patient referral practices of physicians;\n •our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n •the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n •the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n •the impact of public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would reduce the capital we have available to support current and future product candidates and may result in the need to raise additional capital earlier than planned and could cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\n\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\n During the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts (generally referred to as adverse events), to their doctor. We are required to report adverse events to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Often, it is not possible to determine whether the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm or refute these observations, if they occur. In addition, it is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our current product candidates or any future product candidates, have side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\n Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue through their sale may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\n Additionally, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a “black box” warning or a contraindication, or the adoption of a REMS program to ensure that the benefits outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the drug for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners, and/or significant restrictions on distribution or use of the drug. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n •regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate;\n •regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions;\n •we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials, including one or more post-market studies;\n •we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n •we may be required to implement a REMS, including the creation of a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n •we may need to conduct a recall; and\n •our reputation may suffer.\n Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nInterim “top-line” and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n From time to time, we may announce interim top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\n\nOur operations could be disrupted by failure of our information systems or cyber-attacks.\n  Our operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail, if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades, or if we are subject to cyber-attacks. Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and networks, hardware and software systems and our other information technology. We collect and maintain information, which includes confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our employees and business contacts, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, viruses, worms, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. As discussed below in Item 1C, our systems have been subject to security incidents, none of which have been material. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. A failure of our systems, or an inability to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or an inability to successfully integrate new technologies into our existing systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n  The Company and its vendors’ sophisticated information technology operations are spread across multiple, sometimes inconsistent, platforms, which pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity across systems. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional or improper dissemination or destruction of confidential information stored in the Company’s systems.\n Any breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n The use or anticipated use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies, including generative AI, by us or third parties, may increase or create new operational risks.\n\nAI technologies offer numerous potential benefits, such as creating or increasing operational efficiencies, and we expect the use of AI and generative AI by us, third parties on our behalf, and other market actors, including our competitors, to increase. However, the deployment of such technologies also poses certain risks, including that the algorithms may be flawed, misused or otherwise function in an unexpected manner; data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information; and inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users could impair results. The relative newness of the technology, the speed at which it is being adopted, and the paucity of laws, regulations or standards expressly and specifically governing its use increases these risks. If the analyses that AI-based applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. Our competitors may also adopt AI or generative AI more quickly or more effectively than we do, which could cause competitive harm. Furthermore, use of AI-based software may lead to the release of confidential information which may impact our ability to realize the benefits of our intellectual property.\n \nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\n Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\n\n\nIf we fail to comply with applicable data protection, privacy, and similar consumer protection laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties, or incur other costs that could harm our business.\n Numerous federal and state laws and regulations in the U.S. address consumer privacy, regulating the collection, use, disclosure, and security of personal information. Such laws are evolving, many are recently enacted, and all are subject to potentially differing interpretations. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which initially came into effect on January 1, 2020, created new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA was then amended, and those amendments, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, included new rights and established a new agency in California, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”), to implement and enforce the CCPA. Today, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches, among other things. The CPPA is currently considering rules that would potentially broaden the scope of the requirements in areas such as cybersecurity and so-called automated decision-making technologies. The CCPA may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs that adversely affect business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. We cannot predict what new regulations CPPA might adopt, or what amendments the California legislature may enact. And while some states have already enacted very similar privacy laws, we cannot predict what other states may enact their own privacy laws, what the scope and requirements of such laws may be, or how they will affect our business.\n Increased scrutiny of our corporate citizenship and sustainability will likely result in additional costs and risks and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n There is an increasing focus from certain customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning matters relating to corporate citizenship and sustainability. If our practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, support for local communities, human capital management, employee health and safety practices and corporate governance and transparency, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us.\n The standards for tracking and reporting on corporate citizenship and sustainability matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. The disclosure frameworks we choose to align with, if any, may change from time-to-time and may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period. Ensuring there are systems and processes in place to comply with various tracking and reporting obligations will require management time and expense. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\n If we fail to adopt corporate citizenship and sustainability standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire, fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Our business could be negatively impacted by such matters. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n \nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n We rely on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\n We have engaged contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials. We also expect to engage CROs for any of our other product candidates that may progress to clinical development. We expect to rely on CROs, as well as other third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. Agreements with such third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities would be delayed.\n Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is\n\nconducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulatory standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Similar regulatory requirements apply outside the United States, including the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH.\n We are also required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on government-sponsored, publicly accessible databases, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so by us or by third parties can result in FDA refusal to approve applications based on the clinical data, enforcement actions, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\n Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\n In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the results of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA of any NDA we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\n We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure or regulatory noncompliance on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, resulting in additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\n We depend on information technology and a failure of, or significant disruption to, those systems, or a failure to adequately adopt emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems (including cloud services) to operate our business, which are inherently vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Certain of these applications and systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties. Data privacy or security breaches of our internal systems or those of our information technology vendors may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers, employees or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, neither our business nor operations have been materially impacted by such incidents, however, the healthcare industry remains a target of cyber‐attacks. Cybersecurity attacks and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity and, due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. Our investments in the protection of our data and information technology and our efforts to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis may be insufficient to prevent compromises in our information technology systems that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from our or third-party providers’ databases or information technology systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to us and potentially substantial remediation costs. In addition, our cyber insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems or those of our third‐party vendors. Additionally, we utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies in select applications to support our operations. These technologies may present opportunities for our business but may also entail risks, including that AI‐generated analyses utilized by us could be deficient or exacerbate regulatory, cybersecurity or other significant risks. Further, our failure to effectively implement these technologies could hinder our ability to compete, as competitors’ advancements in AI may lead to more efficient operations.\n\n\nWe rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of both our product and commercial candidates, and we may seek additional collaborations in the future. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product or commercial candidates.\n We have limited capabilities for drug development, and our product development programs and the commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. As a result of these factors, we are, and expect to continue to be, dependent on collaborations relating to the development of our existing and future product candidates. We have had and will continue to have discussions on potential partnering opportunities with various pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we may seek third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, particularly for the commercialization of our product candidates outside the United States. Likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies and we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. If we fail to enter into or maintain collaborations on reasonable terms or at all, our ability to develop our existing or future product candidates could be delayed, the commercial potential of our products could change, and our costs of development and commercialization could increase. If we enter into any future collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\n Our collaborations and any future collaborations we might enter into may pose a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n •collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n •collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or contractually obligated;\n •collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n •collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n •product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n •a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such products;\n •disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n •collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n •collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n •collaborators may be subject to geo-political actions, natural disasters or other occurrences, including public health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\n\n•collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\n •collaborators’ decisions may limit the availability of the product supplies required for development, clinical and commercial activities.\n Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or successful commercialization of product or commercial candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\n Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial supplies of the product candidates that we are developing or evaluating. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of our product candidates, and our strategy is to outsource all manufacturing of our product candidates and approved products, if any, to third parties.\n To conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we will need to identify suitable manufacturers with the capabilities to manufacture our compounds in large quantities in a manner consistent with existing regulations. Our third-party manufacturers may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up activities and at any other time. If our manufacturers are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing and clinical trials of that product candidate may be delayed, or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business.\n Even if we can establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including but not limited to:\n •reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n •the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n •the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n •the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and\n •supply chain disruptions due to geo-political actions, natural disasters or public healthy crises, including epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\n Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\n\n\nWe may not be able to win government or non-profit contracts or grants to fund our product development activities.\n Historically, we have relied in part on funding from contracts or grants from government agencies and non-profit entities and it is part of our strategy to continue to do so. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the ongoing development of our product candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible to receive certain contracts or grants that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants will be awarded, and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we can satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that we will be selected to receive any contract or grant. If we are not successful in achieving this form of funding for our clinical trials, we will need to seek alternative means of funding which may not be available to the same extent, if at all.\n Our reliance on government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research, development and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of the research, development and commercialization of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs.\n Aspects of certain of our development programs are currently being supported, in part, with funding from the NIH, NIAID, CARB-X and the DOD. Contracts and grants awarded by the U.S. government, its agencies and its partners, including our awards from the NIH, NIAID, CARB-X, and the DOD, include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n •terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason at all;\n •provide grant support to potential competitor programs;\n •reduce or modify the government’s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n •claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n •audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n •suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n •impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n •suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n •control and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n •pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n •limit the government’s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\n We may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\n In addition, government contracts and grants, and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants, normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n •specialized accounting systems unique to government awards;\n\n\n•mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n •adhering to stewardship principles imposed by CARB-X as a condition of the award;\n •public disclosures of certain award information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n •mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\n As an organization, we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails. If we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and termination of our contracts.\n As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance on our contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts. Based on the results of its audits, the government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\n Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\n Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, such product candidate may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n Even if we obtain approvals from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies and can initiate commercialization of a product candidate we develop, the product candidate may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, including pharmacy directors, and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including but not limited to:\n •the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n •the potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the product candidates, including cost and clinical benefit relative to alternative treatments;\n •the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n •the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n •acceptance by physicians, patients, operators of hospitals, including in-hospital formularies, and treatment facilities and parties responsible for coverage and reimbursement of the product;\n •the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n •the ability to manufacture our product in sufficient quantities and yields;\n •the strength and effectiveness of marketing and distribution support;\n •the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n •limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product’s approved labeling or an approved REMS;\n •whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;\n •the approval of other new products for the same indications;\n •the timing of market introduction of the approved product as well as competitive products;\n\n\n•the emergence of bacterial resistance to the product; and\n •the rate at which resistance to other drugs in the target infections grow.\n Any failure by any of our product candidates that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\n We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing, or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\n The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major multi-national pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies with respect to our current and future product candidates. There are several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, more effectively marketed and sold or less costly than our product candidates, which could render our product candidates non-competitive and obsolete.\n If our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than we do, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\n Regulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars, health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less burdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. In the U.S., the FDA has issued several “interchangeability” designations for biosimilar products and is expected to continue doing so in the future. These designations could – subject to state law requirements – enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products.\n Many of such our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do as an organization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\n Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory agencies for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in product approval delays if a competitor obtains market exclusivity from the FDA or the EMA, or our competitors establish a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. Additional drugs may become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic drugs.\n Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are\n\nmanufactured - often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites - as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\n The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\n Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our current or any future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell profitably, if approved.\n Market acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we or our collaborators commercialize will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health care programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each payor determines whether it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its list of covered drugs, or formulary, it will be placed. The position on a payor’s formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our drugs, and providers are unlikely to prescribe our drugs, unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drugs and their administration.\n A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain marketing approval for. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our current and any future product candidates that we develop.\n Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\n We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any drugs that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n •reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n •decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n •injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n •withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n •initiation of investigations by regulators;\n •product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n •significant costs to defend the resulting litigation;\n •substantial monetary awards paid to clinical trial participants or patients;\n •loss of revenue; and\n\n\n•the inability to commercialize any drugs that we may develop.\n We currently hold product liability insurance coverage in an amount that may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\n There are a variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally, which could affect our business.\n We or our collaborators may seek regulatory approval for our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including but not limited to:\n •differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n •the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally;\n •unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n •economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets;\n •compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n •foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n •foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n •difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n •workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n •reduced level of reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes compared to the United States;\n •potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n •challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n •production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n •business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, fires, and public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n These and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\n Risks Related to Managing Our Growth\n We have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions. Acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and impair our financial results.\n As part of our business strategy, we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services or technologies that we believe could accelerate our ability to compete in our existing markets or allow us to enter new markets. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to properly evaluate or integrate acquisitions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may\n\nincur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results.\n Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments which could harm our financial results. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results.\n If we engage in future acquisitions or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\n From time to time, we may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary drugs, intellectual property rights, technologies or businesses, as deemed appropriate to carry out our business plan. Any potential acquisition or strategic collaboration may entail numerous risks, including but not limited to:\n •increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n •the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n •assimilation of operations, intellectual property and drugs of an acquired company, including challenges associated with integrating new personnel;\n •the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing drug programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic partnership, merger or acquisition;\n •retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n •risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing drugs or drug candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n •our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or drugs sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\n Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be adversely affected.\n Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technology and product candidates. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage that we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. To protect our proprietary positions, we file patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business.\n The patent application and prosecution process are expensive and time-consuming. We, our current licensees, or any future licensors and licensees may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We or our current licensees, or any future licensors or licensees may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\n Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with our best interests. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensees, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised, and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our\n\npatents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and/or unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.\n The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. For example, European patent law currently restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. In addition, the determination of patent rights with respect to pharmaceutical compounds and technologies commonly involves complex legal and factual questions, which has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Furthermore, recent changes in patent laws in the United States, including the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights.\n We may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our current and future product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Similarly, should we own any patents or patent applications in the future, we may not be certain that we were the first to file for patent protection for the inventions claimed in such patents or patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in derivation, ex-parte reexamination, or inter partes review proceedings in the USPTO or similar proceedings elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\n Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic versions of any approved products by submitting abbreviated new drug applications to the FDA in which they claim that patents owned or licensed by us are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable.\n The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate, a patent being held unenforceable, and/or in one or more or in patent claims being narrowed or invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\n Patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest filing date of a non-provisional application to which the patent claims priority. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product\n\ncandidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours.\n In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our candidates might expire before or shortly after our candidates are commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union, as discussed above. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\n We may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n A third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we could be forced to accept unfavorable contractual terms. If we are unable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.\n If we are unable to obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected technology and product candidates, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\n Competitors and other third parties may infringe our issued patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable or that one or more claims of a patent are invalid, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent’s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the basis that our patents do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\n In any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive because of the proceedings.\n\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\n Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could significantly harm our business.\n There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Intellectual property disputes arise in several areas including with respect to patents, use of other proprietary rights and the contractual terms of license arrangements. Third parties may assert claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance.\n If we are found to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative effect on our business.\n We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. In some cases, we may not be able to obtain patent protection for certain licensed technology outside the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we do pursue patent protection or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions.\n Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and preclinical programs and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if pursued and obtained, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\n\n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n In addition to seeking patent and trademark protection for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Despite these efforts and the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information due to our reliance on third parties, increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.\n Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\n Moreover, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products and replicate some or all the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\n Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\n Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or any future collaborators from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if, and in which territories, we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a product candidate.\n Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, export, and reporting of safety and other post-market information, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us or a potential collaborator from commercializing the product candidate. We will rely on third parties to assist us in the process of filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. We may not be able to successfully manufacture our products in compliance with applicable requirements such as GMPs. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit its approved use more narrowly than we anticipate, which could limit sales of the product.\n The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\n\n\nIn addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Any marketing approval that we, or any future collaborators, ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\n If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be impaired.\n Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent certain of our product candidates from being marketed in these territories. Any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\n To market and sell our products in the European Union, or EU, and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain approval from the FDA. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all the risks associated with obtaining approval from the FDA. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, denial of approval in one jurisdiction may impact the ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\n Even if we obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we or our collaborators manufacture and market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\n Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the potential requirements to implement a REMS or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements, among other things. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP. We must also comply with FDA requirements for adverse event reporting for commercial products.\n Accordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. We could also be subject to other civil or criminal penalties. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\n The FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the U.S. DOJ, closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use and if we market our products for indications other than their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws.\n Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including but not limited to:\n •litigation involving patients taking our products;\n •restrictions on our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n •restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n •restrictions on product distribution or use;\n •requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n •warning or untitled letters;\n •withdrawal of the products from the market;\n •refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approve applications that we submit;\n •recall of products;\n •fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n •suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n •damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n •unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n •refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n •product seizure; or\n •injunctions or imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\n Non-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\n Non-compliance with U.K. and EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, also can result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the U.K.’s or EU’s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\n\n\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties.\n Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n •federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n •the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n •HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n •HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which created annual reporting requirements for manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to covered recipients, including physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\n\n•analogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the licensure of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n Further, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\n Efforts to ensure that our future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our strategy. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including future collaborators, are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also affect our business.\n Future legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA, the EMA or comparable regulatory authorities, may increase the time and cost required for us or our collaborators to conduct and complete clinical trials of our current and future product candidates.\n The FDA and the EMA have each established regulations to govern the product development and approval process, as have other foreign regulatory authorities. The policies of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities may change. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation, but not all its provisions have yet been implemented. Additionally, in August 2017, the FDA issued final guidance setting forth its current thinking with respect to development programs and clinical trial designs for antibacterial drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need. We cannot predict what if any effect the Cures Act or any existing or future guidance from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will have on the development of our product candidates.\n Recently enacted and future legislation, including relevant provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, may increase the difficulty and cost for us and our collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\n In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\n Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.\n\n\nOther federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 ended the use of the statutory formula for clinician payment and established a quality payment incentive program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians with two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. It is unclear how payment reductions or the introduction of the Quality Payment Program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. It is also unclear if changes in Medicare payments to providers would impact such providers’ willingness to prescribe and administer our products, if approved.\n Heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products and the practices of pharmacy benefit managers and other supply chain entities has also resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, require advance notice of list price increases, establish upper payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards, allow the importation of drugs from other countries, address pharmacy benefit manager practices, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act contains provisions designed to limit the prices paid by Medicare for various prescription drugs.\n \nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us or our collaborators from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\n Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\n Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.\nPublic and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our consolidated results of operations. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical value from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated value. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S., state level transparency initiatives, importation rules, reporting requirements, and mandated programs, including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans, may also increase administrative costs, in some cases, compromise confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impact our business.\nOutside of the United States, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed.\n Further, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers, including in relation to the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, reference pricing, and compulsory licensing, may adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and require ongoing assessment of the methods by\n\nwhich we calculate and report pricing. Calculation methodologies are inherently subjective and are subject to review and challenge by government agencies. If agencies disagree with our calculations, or the methodologies and assumptions underlying them, we may need to restate previously reported data and could be subject to financial and legal liability, which may be significant. In addition, changes to calculation methodologies could adversely affect our financial position or consolidated results of operations in any given period.\n Risks Related to our Alliance with GSK\n Because a portion of our current revenues and near-term projected revenues have historically been derived from products under the GSK Agreements, disputes with GSK could harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall.\n Historically, all of our current and near-term projected revenues have been derived from products under the GSK Agreements. We expect royalties from such products will likely continue to comprise a portion of our revenues in the future. Any action or inaction by either GSK or us that results in a material dispute, allegation of breach, litigation, arbitration, or significant disagreement between the parties may be interpreted negatively by the market or by our investors, could harm our business and cause the price of our securities to fall. Examples of these kinds of issues include but are not limited to non‑performance of contractual obligations and allegations of non‑performance, disagreements over the relative marketing and sales efforts for our partnered products and other GSK respiratory products, disputes over public statements, and similar matters.\nBecause GSK is a strategic partner, it may take actions that in certain cases are materially harmful to our business or to our stockholders.\n GSK is a strategic partner with rights and obligations under the GSK Agreements that cause its interests to differ from our interests and those of our stockholders. In particular, GSK has a substantial respiratory product portfolio in addition to the partnered products that are covered by the GSK Agreements. GSK may make respiratory product portfolio decisions or statements about its portfolio which may be, or may be perceived to be, harmful to the respiratory products partnered with us. For example, GSK could promote its non‑GSK/Innoviva respiratory products or a partnered product for which we are entitled to receive a lower percentage of royalties, delay or terminate the development or commercialization of the respiratory programs covered by the GSK Agreements, or take other actions, such as making public statements, that have a negative effect on our stock price. In this regard and by way of example, sales of Advair®, GSK’s approved medicine for both COPD and asthma, continue to be significantly greater than sales of RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, and GSK has indicated publicly that it intends to continue commercializing Advair®. Also, given the potential future royalty payments which GSK may be obligated to pay under the GSK Agreements, GSK may seek to acquire us in order to reduce those payment obligations. The timing of when GSK may seek to acquire us could potentially be when it possesses information regarding the status of drug programs covered by the GSK Agreements that has not been publicly disclosed and is not otherwise known to us. As a result of these differing interests, GSK may take actions that it believes are in its best interest but which might not be in our best interest or the best interest of our stockholders.\n\nGSK has also indicated to us that it believes its consent may be required before we can engage in certain royalty monetization transactions with third parties, which may inhibit our ability to engage in these transactions.\n GSK indicated to us that it believes that its consent may be required before we can engage in certain transactions designed to monetize the future value of royalties that may be payable to us from GSK under the GSK Agreements. GSK has informed us that it believes that there may be certain covenants included in these types of transactions that might violate certain provisions of the GSK Agreements. Although we believe that we can structure royalty monetization transactions in a manner that fully complies with the requirements of the GSK Agreements without GSK’s consent, a third party in a proposed monetization transaction may nonetheless insist that we obtain GSK’s consent for the transaction or restructure the transaction on less favorable terms. We have obtained GSK’s agreement that (i) we may grant certain pre‑agreed covenants in connection with monetization of our interests in RELVAR®/BREO® ELLIPTA®, ANORO® ELLIPTA® and vilanterol monotherapy, and (ii) it will not unreasonably withhold its consent to our requests to grant other covenants, provided among other conditions, that in each case, the covenants are not granted in favor of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with a product either being developed or commercialized for the treatment of respiratory disease. If we seek GSK’s consent to grant covenants other than pre‑agreed covenants, we may not be able to obtain GSK’s consent on reasonable terms, or at all. If we proceed with a royalty monetization transaction that is not otherwise covered by the GSK Agreement without GSK’s consent, GSK could request that its consent be obtained or seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge the transaction as violating or allowing it to terminate the GSK Agreements. Regardless of the merit of any claims by GSK, we would incur significant cost and diversion of resources in defending against GSK’s claims or asserting our own claims and GSK may seek concessions from us in order to provide its consent. Any uncertainty about whether or when we could engage in a royalty monetization transaction, the potential impact on the enforceability of the GSK Agreements or the loss of potential royalties from the respiratory programs partnered with GSK, could impair our ability to pursue a return of capital strategy for our stockholders ahead of our receipt of significant royalties from GSK, result in significant reduction in the market price of our securities and cause other material harm to our business.\n General Risks Factors\n Unfavorable global economic conditions, whether brought about by material global crises, health epidemics, military conflicts or war, geopolitical and trade disputes or other factors, may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n Our business is sensitive to global economic conditions, which can be adversely affected by epidemics and other public health crises, political and military conflict, trade and other international disputes, significant natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) or other events that disrupt macroeconomic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy or government budget dynamics (particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotech areas), tighter credit, higher interest rates, volatility in financial markets, high unemployment, labor availability constraints, currency fluctuations and other challenges in the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, us and our business partners and suppliers.\n Further, military conflicts or wars (such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East) can cause exacerbated volatility and disruptions to various aspects of the global economy. The uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from such conflicts, including the potential effects of sanctions and counter-sanctions, or retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, have contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic factors that affect our business and operations, such as worldwide supply chain issues. It is not possible to predict the short and long-term implications of military conflicts or wars or geopolitical tensions which could include further sanctions, uncertainty about economic and political stability, increases in inflation rate and energy prices, cyber-attacks, supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency exchange rates and financial markets.\n Additionally, the operations of our suppliers and manufacturers may be located in areas that are prone to earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters. Such operations and facilities are also subject to the risk of interruption by drought, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health crises, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can create delays or interruptions to the Company’s development efforts and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain. Significant delays in our development efforts could materially impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval and to commercialize our products.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:\n •delays in receiving authorization from regulatory authorities to initiate any planned clinical trials, inspections, reviews and approvals of products;\n\n\n•delays or difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n •delays in or disruptions to the conduct of preclinical programs and clinical trials;\n •constraints on the movement of products and supplies through the supply chain, which can disrupt our ability to conduct clinical trials and develop our products;\n •price increases in raw materials and capital equipment, as well as increasing price competition in our markets;\n •adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees; and\n •increased risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting or if the interpretations, estimates or judgments utilized in preparing our financial statements prove to be incorrect, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\n The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under the SEC’s current rules, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing and our independent registered public accounting firm’s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. We have and expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and to expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404. If we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the SEC, FINRA, The Nasdaq Global Select Market or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct any material weaknesses that may be identified or to respond to any regulatory investigations or proceedings.\n We are also subject to complex tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and interpretations thereof. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to interpret accounting principles and guidance and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our interpretations, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the preparation of our financial statements. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) presentation is subject to interpretation by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. In the event that one of these bodies disagrees with our accounting recognition, measurement or disclosure or any of our accounting interpretations, estimates or assumptions, it may have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. The need to restate our financial results could, among other potential adverse effects, result in our incurring substantial costs, affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports until such restatement is completed, divert the attention of our management and employees from managing our business, result in material changes to our historical and future financial results, result in investors losing confidence in our operating results, subject us to securities class action litigation, and cause our stock price to decline.\n\n\nOur employees or third-party providers, or employees or third-party providers of our portfolio companies may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\n We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third-party providers of our portfolio companies. Misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third-party providers of our portfolio companies could include intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the health care industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, third party providers, or employees or third party providers of our portfolio companies, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\n We have incurred litigation and may incur additional litigation.\n We have been subject to various legal proceedings, and, in the future, we may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation, claims and proceedings incident to the ordinary course of, or otherwise in connection with, our business. In addition, agreements entered into by us sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\n Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase our operating expenses.\n If one or more legal matters were resolved against us or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n While we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or “FCPA”, as well as the anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\n We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls. In addition, we are subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Our employees or other agents may engage in prohibited conduct without our knowledge under our policies and procedures and the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws that we may be subject to for which we may be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n We are subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities and affect our results of operations.\n We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions, and in the course of our business, we make judgments about the expected tax treatment of various transactions and events. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, disclosure obligations, and interpretations, as well as events that differ from our expectations, have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates, cash flows, and/or results of operations. In addition, tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of cross-border tax issues, which could unfavorably impact our results of operations. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the\n\nEuropean Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate, such as the recent enactments by both the EU and non-EU countries of a global minimum tax. Modifications to key elements of the U.S. or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows.\n \nThe widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted and may in the future impact our business, operations and financial condition and results. Related risks and challenges for our business include, among others: uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of a pandemic; impacts to business operations; decreased demand for certain of our products; increased costs of doing business; manufacturing disruptions and delays; supply chain disruptions and shortages, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers resulting in reduced availability of materials or components used in the development, manufacturing, distribution or administration of our products; evolving macroeconomic factors and conditions, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures; changes in labor markets, including challenges related to our human capital and talent development; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to any potential pandemic response; increased difficulty and uncertainty regarding predicting or estimating future performance; pace of post-pandemic recovery, disruption and volatility within the financial or credit markets; and our financial performance in general.\n \nUnder the Services Agreement with Sarissa Capital, we may rely on Sarissa Capital to assist in our strategic investing activity.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, we entered into the Services Agreement pursuant to which Sarissa Capital provides substantial assistance to us in connection with our acquisition strategy. Pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, Sarissa Capital will, among other things: (i) assist Innoviva in the development of an overall acquisition and investment process and strategy; (ii) advise Innoviva on market trends, market dynamics and merger and acquisition activity; (iii) identify potential transaction targets; (iv) assist in due diligence of transaction targets and the negotiation and execution of transactions; (v) advise on the growth and operational plans, performance and integration of target companies once an investment or acquisition is made; and (vi) assist in the identification of director and officer candidates for target companies. The services are provided by Sarissa Capital personnel and we have limited or no ability to control the manner upon which the services are provided. In the event that Sarissa Capital fails to adequately perform the required services, our investment activity operations and financial performance may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur investment into the Partnership, managed by Sarissa Capital, could subject us to various risks and uncertainties, any of which could impact our investment results and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nHistorically, we have invested our cash reserves in short-term investments and marketable securities, primarily corporate notes, government securities, government agencies, and commercial papers. On December 11, 2020, we entered into the Partnership Agreement and invested $300 million of our cash reserves to be managed by Sarissa Capital as the investment manager to the Partnership.\n\nWhile we expect that a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from our royalty management business and the sales of our products, as a result of this investment, we may derive a material portion of our income from assets managed by Sarissa Capital. The investment strategy of Sarissa Capital will focus on a concentrated portfolio of “long” positions in publicly or privately traded securities (debt or equity) and derivatives of, and other financial instruments related to, each of the foregoing, specifically in the areas of healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The risks associated with this investment strategy may be substantially greater than the risks associated with traditional fixed-income investment strategies or other low-yield strategies.\n\nWe have limited rights to remove the general partner of the Partnership and do not have any right to participate in the management of the Partnership or the investment activity of Sarissa Capital. We are solely dependent on Sarissa Capital’s management of our investment in the Partnership. We cannot provide assurance that Sarissa Capital will be successful in meeting our investment objectives. Unexpected market volatility or losses in the Partnership’s securities portfolio could significantly and negatively affect our investment in the Partnership and therefore our investment results, financial condition or results of operations.\n \nIn October 2024, we made an election to unwind the capital accounts in the Partnership in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement and we expect to receive distributions of our capital accounts through April 2026.\n \n\nThe price of our securities has been volatile and may continue to be so, and purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses.\n \nThe price of our securities has been volatile and may continue to be so. Between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024, the high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market varied between $14.33 and $21.28 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the companies’ operating performance, in particular during the last several years.\n\nWe may be unable to or elect not to return capital to our stockholders.\n \nThe payment of, or continuation of, capital returns to stockholders is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, execution of our strategic initiatives, general business conditions, tax treatment of capital returns, potential future contractual restrictions contained in our credit agreement and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Future capital returns may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and our working capital and debt maintenance requirements; legal risks; stock or debt repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. Our capital return programs may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to provide any particular amounts. Our announcement of future capital return programs does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount of debt or equity or number of shares of common stock. A reduction, suspension or change in our capital return programs could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n \nAnti‑takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\n \nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions include:\n •requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws;\n •restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n •prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n •establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings.\n \nIn addition, some provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.",
