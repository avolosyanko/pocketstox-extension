      "text": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nRoblox operates a free to use immersive platform for connection and communication (the “Roblox Platform” or “Platform”), where every day, millions of users come to create, play, work, learn, and connect with each other in experiences built by our global community of creators. Our vision is to reimagine the way people come together – in a world that is safe, civil, and optimistic. To achieve this vision, we are building an innovative company that, together with the Roblox community, has the ability to strengthen our social fabric and support economic growth for people around the world.\nOur Platform consists of the Roblox Client, the Roblox Studio, and the Roblox Cloud. Roblox Client is the application that allows users to seamlessly explore 3D immersive experiences. Roblox Studio is the free toolset that allows developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D immersive experiences and other content accessed with the Roblox Client. Roblox Cloud includes the services and infrastructure that power our Platform.\nOur mission is to connect a billion users with optimism and civility. We are constantly improving the ways in which our Platform supports shared experiences, ranging from how these experiences are built by an engaged community of developers and creators to how they are enjoyed and safely accessed by users across the globe.\n![alt  two_network_effect_Roblox_2025.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000131509825000033/rblx-20241231_g1.jpg)\nGrowth at Roblox has been driven primarily by a significant investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social.\nFirst, user-generated content, built by our community of developers and creators, powers our Platform. As developers and creators build increasingly high-quality content, more users are attracted to our Platform. With more users on our Platform, greater engagement and monetization opportunities exist, which in turn, makes Roblox more attractive to developers and creators, incentivizing them to design increasingly engaging content and encouraging new developers and creators to start building on our Platform.\nSecond, our Platform is social. When users join, they typically interact with friends, which inspires them to invite more friends, who in turn, invite their friends, driving organic growth. The more friends that each of our users have interacting on the Platform, the more valuable and engaging the Platform becomes. This drives more users to our Platform through word of mouth from their existing friends on the Platform.\nOur User and Creator Community\nRoblox is powered by content from our community of developers and creators who build immersive and engaging experiences found only on Roblox, as well as the vast majority of the items for customizing avatars. This content attracts our users to immerse themselves in the millions of experiences found on the Platform. Many of our users may also eventually become developers and creators, and nearly all developers and creators started as users. \n8\n\n\n![alt  10-K_Annual_Report_DAU_Breakdown.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000131509825000033/rblx-20241231_g2.jpg)\nOur Users\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, 82.9 million average DAUs across over 180 countries enjoyed experiences on Roblox across mobile, desktop, and console platforms, of which on average, approximately 1.0 million were daily unique paying users. Our users are diversified across multiple dimensions, including age, geography, platform, and gender. Each day, users express themselves through their avatars, explore different worlds, and engage with others in the Roblox community. During the year ended December 31, 2024, users spent 73.5 billion hours engaged on our Platform, or an average of 2.4 hours per DAU each day. Over the same period, our users explored an average of over 21 different experiences on the Roblox Platform per month.\nGlobal DAU = 82.9 million(1)\n(1)Represents the average during the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to “Special Note Regarding Operating Metrics” for details on operating metrics used. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in thousands and may not add to their respective totals due to rounding.\n![alt  1488](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000131509825000033/rblx-20241231_g3.jpg)\nOur Developers and Creators\nWe offer developers and creators the ability to build engaging, immersive experiences and marketplace items that they can easily share with the Roblox community. We refer to users who create experiences and marketplace items as creators, while developers represent a subset of the creator community that create experiences on the Platform or build and sell custom tools to help other developers create experiences. In this way, our developers and creators enable us to offer a wide variety of experiences and avatar items and cost-effectively crowd-source our experiences, marketplace content, and developer tool ecosystem. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we had millions of active developers with hours engaged in their experiences across more than 170 countries on the Roblox Platform. Our developer and creator community includes individuals with a wide spectrum of professional capabilities and team sizes, ranging from young students and independent hobbyists, all the way to full-time studios.\nWe measure the health and success of our developer and creator community based on their earnings and the user engagement in their experiences. As our Platform has scaled, our monetizing developers and creators have enjoyed meaningful earnings expansion over time, reflecting the increasing popularity and opportunities for monetization of our Platform and driving a growing incentive for our developers and creators to continue to build high-quality content.\nWe offer our creator and developer community several economic models to help support their goals. Specifically, developers and creators can generate earnings (either in Robux or in some circumstances, directly in fiat currency) through the following methods:\n![alt  2024-Engagement-Distribution-Chart.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000131509825000033/rblx-20241231_g4.jpg)\n1.Monetizing a developed experience: Developers qualified for our Developer Exchange Program can earn Robux through:\na.In-experience purchases, which consist of microtransactions generated from the sale of in-experience virtual items, subscription-based offerings (including access to private servers), access to certain experiences (referred to as paid access), and/or passes granting special in-experience privileges.\nb.Engagement-Based Payouts, which allows developers to earn Robux based on the share of time that Roblox Premium subscribers engage in their experience.\nc.Advertisements (“ads”), which include a range of high-quality, programmatically served ad units through which developers can earn Robux from impressions and/or teleports generated.\n2.Creating and selling or reselling avatar items: Creators can create and sell entire avatars, accessories, clothes, bodies, and heads for avatars in the Marketplace or inside experiences. \n3.Creating and selling Roblox Studio plugins: Through the Creator Store, developers and creators can sell Roblox Studio plugins in fiat currency, which are extensions that add additional features or functionality to Roblox Studio and help improve creator workflows.\n4.Affiliate Programs: Influencers and creators can earn a share of Robux from purchases made by users they direct to Roblox.\nAs of December 31, 2024, over 24,500 developers and creators qualified for and were registered in our Developer Exchange Program, of which over 7,500 were newly qualified and registered during 2024. In order to be qualified for our Developer Exchange Program and eligible to exchange earned Robux for fiat currency, developers and creators must meet certain conditions, such as having earned the minimum amount of Robux required to qualify for the program, a verified developer account, and an account in good standing. On January 31, 2022, we reduced the minimum amount of earned Robux required to qualify for the program from 100,000 Robux to 50,000 Robux and subsequently on January 31, 2023, we further reduced the minimum requirement from 50,000 Robux to 30,000 Robux. We believe these reductions in the minimum amounts required incentivize our developer and creator community, and promote the long term growth and health of such community. For the year ended December 31, 2024, over 17,000 developers and creators actually exchanged their earned Robux for fiat currency through our Developer Exchange Program.\nWe invest in our developers and creators by providing a comprehensive set of free tools and services through Roblox Studio, the Roblox Open Cloud, and a range of other creator resources that enable them to easily build, publish, analyze, grow, and monetize experiences. We empower developers and creators to get started with minimal upfront costs as we cover hosting, storage, customer support, localization, certain regulatory requirements, payment processing, and platform fees. We provide appropriate support for all developers and creators to promote engagement and growth in our developer and creator community. This includes managing and moderating our online developer and creator forums and operating special programs for aspiring and top developers and creators such as our annual Roblox Developers Conference. With Roblox Open Cloud, developers and creators can leverage a suite of backend APIs to seamlessly build and scale their experiences.\nThe investment in our developer community has resulted in an ever-changing offering of diverse content for our users to explore and engage in. The chart below provides detail on the diversity of content our users engage in within experiences. Specifically, this chart reflects the distribution of in-experience hours engaged within the top 1,000 experiences by month from January to December 2024.\nOur Products and Technology\nThe Roblox Platform is the underlying technology and infrastructure that supports shared experiences and is composed of three elements:\n•Roblox Client—The free application that allows users to explore 3D immersive experiences.\n•Roblox Studio—The free toolset that allows developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D immersive experiences and other content accessed with the Roblox Client.\n•Roblox Cloud—The services and infrastructure that power the Roblox Client and Roblox Studio.\nSince our founding, we have invested heavily in building the Roblox Platform, and as of December 31, 2024, 77% of our employees were dedicated to maintaining, improving, and expanding it. Our technology supports the following key characteristics of the Roblox Platform: Identity, Connection and Communication, Immersive, Low Friction, Variety of Content, Anywhere, Economy, and Safety.\nIdentity\nThe Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. Our avatar technology supports a wide variety of character styles, ranging from classic avatars with blocky body shapes, to ones with more human proportions, from anime characters, to fantasy avatars, and more. Avatars can also be animated and mirror a user’s movements and facial expressions on the avatar in real time, allowing more interactive and authentic communication. Creators can also build avatar creation tools in their experiences, allowing users to create more personalized avatars.\nThe Roblox Client features the Avatar Editor, which enables users to manipulate the size and body shape of their avatars as well as equip their avatar with clothing, gear, animations, simulated gestures, or emotes, and other accessories from the Marketplace. Our avatar system allows users to attach practically any accessory to any avatar maximizing the combinatorial variety of avatar configurations supported by the Platform. Users manipulate their avatar through a consistent set of controls for emotes, basic movement, and tap-to-move functionality which adapts to dynamically changing virtual environments. The Roblox Client normalizes camera and avatar control inputs from different device form factors, including mobile, tablet, desktop, and game console, to simplify the process of building multi-user, multi-platform, and avatar-based experiences.\nWithin most experiences, avatars appear exactly how they were configured in the Avatar Editor, creating a sense of persistent identity. However, developers, when designing experiences, have the freedom to dynamically reconfigure all or part of the participating avatars to meet the specific needs of the developer’s experience.\nConnection and Communication\nThe Roblox Client allows users to easily connect with real life friends (through features such as contact importer) and meet new friends (by matching users with similar characteristics, such as country location, for example). The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud and requires mutual opt-in to avoid unwanted communications.\nThe social graph is central to human connection and communication. When a user chooses to join an experience, the Roblox Cloud is designed to automatically place that user into the same virtual environment as others connected through the social graph. In addition, most developers allow users to purchase private servers that allow groups of friends to share an exclusive, invite-only instance of a 3D immersive experience.\nAdditionally, the Roblox Platform facilitates communication with in-experience text-based chat amongst users of all ages joining the same 3D immersive experience. For safety, every text message passes through filters that block content which violates applicable Roblox Community Standards (e.g. personally identifiable information or directing users off platform). Using advanced pattern matching and machine learning, our chat filters are constantly evolving and process billions of messages per day.\nWe have also expanded our communication features through voice chat, now available in over 30 countries around the world and in several supported languages, allowing users aged 13 and over to communicate using their voice in Roblox experiences. This proximity-based feature simulates realistic communication through lip sync and is based on how close users are in an experience to other users who are speaking in that experience. In addition, avatar animation allows all users to use their camera to animate their avatar with their movement, allowing them to communicate and express themselves in more natural, real-time, and immersive ways.\nRecently, we launched Party, a new way to connect and coordinate with friends. With Party, up to six friends can easily join the same instance of an experience and even move together from one experience to another. Users aged 13 and older can also use Party chat to text chat with one another.\nImmersive\nThe Roblox Platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share synchronous experiences with others, independent of where they may be physically. The Roblox Client provides users with intuitive camera and input controls that are tuned for each device’s form factor. By abstracting these controls from developers, the process of building cross platform 3D immersive experiences is greatly simplified.\nDevelopers use Roblox Studio to easily build 3D immersive experiences that are then rendered and simulated on the Roblox Platform. The Roblox Client leverages efficient low-level hardware-specific device APIs, such as Vulkan for Android devices and Metal for Apple devices, to efficiently render those experiences. Each experience combines thousands of meshes, textures, 3D models, and animations. Using Roblox Studio, developers can also insert immersive ads into their experiences, which are native and 3D ad units that can programmatically serve ads in image, video, and portal ad formats.\nEach 3D immersive experience is simulated in the Roblox Cloud with a custom physics engine built for rigid body and constraint-based physics. Using a combination of novel mathematical formulations and aggressive optimization, the engine can simulate a large number of complex mechanisms at high levels of fidelity. To achieve an optimal balance between latency, scale, and consistency, computations for the simulation are distributed across Roblox Clients and the Roblox Cloud.\nAssets that make up the 3D immersive experience are stored in a persistent tree hierarchy that is the foundation for collaborative editing and interactive multi-user experiences. The hierarchy can be modified through APIs which serve as a powerful abstraction layer making it easy to create experiences that are consistent across all Roblox Clients, regardless of device type. During simulation, this data is dynamically replicated within the Roblox Cloud and selectively transmitted to Roblox Clients. The Roblox Client then constructs and renders its own view of the 3D immersive experience.\nLow Friction\nThe Roblox Platform gives users the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. As of December 31, 2024, the Roblox Client operates on iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation, and virtual reality (“VR”) hardware such as Meta Quest, and supports VR experiences on PC. With the Roblox Platform, developers can build an experience once and then expect that experience to operate consistently on all supported devices to both take advantage of the capabilities of high end systems and also scale down the experience to work on lower end devices. We continually focus on improving frame rates, increasing stability, and enhancing graphics quality.\nThe Roblox Client is designed for the rapid movement of users between experiences. Almost immediately upon launching a new experience, the Roblox Client will begin simulating and rendering the virtual world using a partial representation of the environment at a low level of detail. As more and higher fidelity assets are received by the Roblox Client, the fidelity of the experience automatically improves.\nAssets are delivered to the Roblox Client through geographically distributed content delivery networks. The Roblox Cloud determines the format, level of detail, and priority of each asset sent in order to optimize for the capabilities and bandwidth available to the client device. The Roblox Client can dynamically load and unload instances and assets as the player moves throughout the experience without waiting for long content preloads, in a process otherwise referred to as streaming. All else being equal, streaming enables faster join times and larger, more complex experiences that can be joined synchronously on different devices regardless of device memory capacity.\nThe Roblox Cloud enables low-latency, responsive interactivity between millions of concurrent users within 3D environments. When a user joins a 3D immersive experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on, among other considerations, the user’s social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. Roblox Cloud is designed to automatically scale up and down the number and size of server instances to effectively serve the current user demand for an experience, thereby allowing the Platform to scale up to handle the most popular experiences while also scaling down when demand reduces. Developers can choose to allow up to 200 users within an instance, but may choose fewer to optimize their experience.\nDevelopers have access to high-speed data stores in the Roblox Cloud where information about users and each simulated environment can be persisted. This, along with other services hosted in the Roblox Cloud, make it possible for a developer to build, launch, scale and monetize a 3D immersive experience without any additional tools or services.\nThe majority of services operated by the Roblox Cloud are hosted in Roblox managed data centers. For some of our high-speed databases, scalable object storage, and message queuing services we leverage Amazon Web Services. Nearly all of the servers tasked with simulating the virtual environment and optimizing assets for Roblox Clients are owned by Roblox and operate from data centers and regional edge data centers widely distributed across 23 cities in North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. As of December 31, 2024, the Roblox Cloud uses over 140,000 servers. The Roblox Cloud is designed to be fault tolerant and prepared for disaster recovery and we continue to expand into multiple data centers within and across geographic regions to improve reliability and fault tolerance.\nData centers in the Roblox Cloud are linked through a high-performance dedicated backbone network bypassing the public internet for traffic within and between our data centers and we operate under an open peering policy where we have direct interconnection with Internet providers globally. Operating our own network maximizes performance, security, and increases the immersiveness experienced by our users.\nVariety of Content\nDevelopers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform, including a variety of experiences from gaming, to education, to entertainment, and beyond. Their efforts contribute to an expanding content library that included over 14 million active experiences and millions of available Marketplace items during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDevelopers build, publish, and operate 3D immersive experiences with Roblox Studio, a free suite of tools accessible to all skill levels. Teams can work together using built-in access control management and collaborative editing. Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences, giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates.\nIn addition to constructing 3D objects and environments, developers can script complex behaviors into their experience with Roblox Luau. Based on Lua, an interpreted light-weight programming language popular in the gaming industry, Roblox Luau adds an optional static type system and a highly optimized interpreter that maximizes performance on Roblox Clients and in the Roblox Cloud. Using scripts, developers can modify the environment, control object behavior, and create new ways for users to interact with the virtual environment. Within Roblox Studio, developers have access to a powerful script editor which supports autocomplete, debugging, and the ability to emulate the Roblox Client running on supported devices.\nRoblox Studio also leverages artificial intelligence (“AI”) to help reduce friction for creators and developers, making it easier to build content on the Platform. These AI tools help developers and creators with varying levels of experience. For example, AI tools such as Assistant help beginner developers and creators by answering common questions, while AI tools such as Code Assist or Materials Generator help developers and creators with some coding experience learn how to write and improve code and easily create more complex materials. Finally, AI tools like Avatar Auto-Setup save creators time by turning 3D avatar models into animated avatar technology.\nCreators can share their work with other creators through the Creator Store. The Creator Store drives collaboration within our developer community, accelerates creation of new experiences, and provides additional ways for creators to monetize their work. As of December 31, 2024, the Creator Store contained millions of models, meshes, textures, scripts, audio clips, developer tools, and packaged combinations of these items.\nWe provide developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. Creator Hub includes reference material, API documentation, and tutorials for developers. Developer Forum is a private forum for qualified developers which provides insight on new features, community initiatives, recruitment opportunities, bug reporting, and direct engagement with our employees. Edu Hub provides content for educators, students, and parents who are using Roblox as a tool to learn coding, 3D design, and digital civility. All developers on the Roblox Platform have access to dashboards that show daily visits to their experience, as well as earned Robux generated from their experience and Marketplace items.\nWithin the Roblox Client, users find experiences through personalized content recommendations, curated homepage sorts and search. Personalized AI-driven content recommendations are based on past user behavior, the social graph, and demographic information collected at signup. An emphasis is always placed on experiences where someone you are connected with is present. Additionally, we curate our homepage to highlight experiences from up-and-coming creators, recently updated experiences and new genres helping our users to try more experiences and increasing the diversity of the content with which they engage. The search engine automatically learns user intent, accounting for misspellings, slang, and multilingual queries.\nAnywhere\nThe Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the year ended December 31, 2024, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed our Platform.\nLocalization systems embedded within the Roblox Client and Roblox Cloud help to lower cultural barriers and enable our developers to meet certain regional requirements with little to no additional effort.\nDevelopers can build experiences in their native language and then, using machine translation and advanced pattern recognition, the Roblox Cloud automatically translates those experiences into 16 languages including simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese. Developers also have the ability to customize all or part of their translations if needed.\nThe Roblox Client can adjust a user’s experience and available content based on their age, device type, current location and where the client application was obtained. This allows Roblox to dynamically apply relevant content filters, anti-addiction rules, payment limits, parental consent requirements, and certain other regional requirements.\nEconomy\nRoblox has a vibrant economy built on a virtual currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and Roblox website or through prepaid cards purchased via online and physical retailers. Roblox works with multiple payment and prepaid card processors including Apple, Blackhawk, Google, Incomm, and Stripe, amongst others. Roblox relies on payment processor partners to store account information.\nUsers can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox Premium. With a subscription, users receive discounted Robux along with access to exclusive or discounted items in the Marketplace. Developers may also choose to offer additional benefits to active Roblox Premium subscribers in the form of discounted virtual merchandise or access to exclusive in-experience features.\nDevelopers and creators earn Robux by selling virtual content or access to virtual content (including through subscriptions), as well as through the incorporation of immersive ads into their experiences, which are ad units that developers can insert into their experience for Roblox to programmatically serve ad content from advertisers.\nDevelopers can also earn Robux through Engagement-Based Payouts based on the share of time that Roblox Premium users engage in their experiences. Engagement-Based Payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. The payout system is designed to protect against fraud and computes a developer’s earnings potential on a daily basis.\nRoblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the fiat currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program. All Developer Exchange Program requests are reviewed on a risk-based approach to mitigate fraud and money laundering. Developers and creators participating in the program are required to create an account with our third party vendor which collects tax information, conducts certain “know your customer” related diligence, and executes the payouts. Their systems are designed to comply with various global regulatory requirements for monetary transactions. Additionally, developers and creators aged 13 and up can convert earned Robux into ad credits to purchase ads on the Platform.\nSafety\nMultiple systems are integrated into the Roblox Platform to promote the safety and civility of our users. These systems are designed to enforce our policies, protect users’ personal information, and abide by local laws. We leverage text-filtering, voice moderation, content moderation, and other automated systems that proactively identify content and behaviors that may violate our policies.\nContent submitted by developers and creators, including images, audio, and video, goes through a multi-step review process before appearing on the Platform. Images and videos are evaluated for Child Sexual Abuse Material using PhotoDNA and Google’s Content Safety API with flagged content automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children upon review. Audio files are scanned for IP infringement. Finally, all assets are subject to review by humans or AI trained on our Community Standards. During the year ended December 31, 2024, including automated reviews, we evaluated over 400 million assets. Assets refer to images, audio files, and video files that developers upload to the Roblox Platform to include in their experiences and in the Marketplace.\nWhen experiences are published or updated on the Roblox Platform, they are evaluated by a suite of AI driven tools that identify problematic language, potential bypasses to our safety systems, and content that falls outside our policies. A human review team is continuously operating to evaluate flagged experiences. The Roblox Platform includes a suite of anti-intruder technology leveraging machine learning, throttles, and circuit breakers designed to block automated bot attacks and mitigate the impact of humans who attempt to spam users and disrupt the service. We also leverage targeted penetration testing, a bug bounty program, code reviews, secure by design principles, targeted security testing, and vulnerability scanning to promote the security of the Platform.\nRoblox operates a customer service portal that provides self-help information along with ways to contact Roblox via email or from within the Roblox Client. In the year ended December 31, 2024, Roblox responded to millions of customer inquiries and had a human respond to actionable safety issues on average within 18 minutes of their submission.\nSafety and Digital Civility\nOur highest priority is to create a safe and civil online environment for our users. Because our Platform includes children aged 5 and over, our safety and civility policies are purpose-built to be strict. We have a multi-layered moderation system that is designed to assess all content uploaded to Roblox for potential safety and civility issues. Our safety and civility policies, which include our Community Standards, define acceptable content and communication, and coupled with user behavior, inform a wide range of AI algorithms that automatically moderate content. Those algorithms are backed up by a team of thousands of moderators focused on improving quality and handling the most difficult decisions. On top of that, we have robust user reporting that provide additional coverage. We have no tolerance on our Platform for content or behavior that violates our Community Standards.\nWe work closely with regulators, authorities, and safety groups in many countries. We endeavor to promptly report any suspected child exploitation or abuse materials to the relevant authorities. Our Platform is designed to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and we regularly monitor and evaluate compliance with other U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).\nWe partner with leading global organizations focused on child and internet safety, including the WeProtect Global Alliance, Digital Wellness Lab, Family Online Safety Institute, UK Safer Internet Centre, Internet Matters, the Internet Watch Foundation, and kidSAFE, among others. We are also a member of various organizations, such as the Association for United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment and the Technology Coalition, with a goal of cross-industry collaboration, knowledge and technology exchange in areas of user safety, and child safety. As a member of the Technology Coalition and a founding member of its cross-platform signal sharing Lantern program, we are committed to providing transparency and promoting child safety online. We also nominate the board chair position of the Family Online Safety Institute where we educate and provide balanced perspectives to policy makers to help draft thoughtful online safety legislation. We continue to work diligently with other digital platforms to report bad actors and inappropriate content so that they can also take appropriate actions on their platforms.\nOur Trust & Safety Systems\nWe use AI and a dedicated team of human moderators to review content, including images, audio, and video, uploaded into our Platform. Our scanning algorithms also review and monitor communications that flow through Roblox to proactively block and protect users from inappropriate behavior, such as questions about personal information and instructions on how to connect on less protective third-party chat applications. The algorithms in our chat filters are age-sensitive: they monitor both what users can say and see based on their ages.\nThroughout our site and in-experience, we provide our users with the ability to report activity that they find objectionable. Users can also block or mute other users with whom they do not want to interact. We also provide parents with customizable parental controls, which allow them to limit access to features like chat, control screen time, and view their child’s friends list. In addition, parents can restrict access to experiences based on their content maturity levels. In 2024, we introduced significant updates to our safety systems and parental controls. As part of this launch, we introduced remote management, which allows parents and caregivers to adjust controls and review their child’s activity even if they aren’t physically together. We also updated the naming of our content labels to give parents greater clarity and restricted access to certain experiences for our youngest users based on user behavior sometimes found in those experiences.\nWe have a dedicated team and thousands of trust & safety agents whose role is to protect our users by focusing on detecting inappropriate content and behavior 24/7 through a combination of AI and human moderation. We take swift action to address any content, developer, creator, or user that violates our terms of use once detected. We have a Safety Advisory Board, made up of global industry experts that advise on the best practices to protect our community.\nWe continue to innovate and release new safety features and policies and invest in technology and people to combat bad actors who attempt to undermine our efforts to connect millions of people. Our priority remains the safety and digital civility of our community.\nThe Roblox Economy\nWe support our developer and creator community by providing the tools to build, publish, operate, drive discovery, and monetize content. Our economy enables developers and creators to generate income through Roblox. As of December 31, 2024, over 24,500 developers qualified for and were registered in our Developer Exchange Program and therefore met certain conditions, such as having earned the minimum amount of Robux required to qualify, having a verified developer account, and having an account in good standing, and were therefore eligible to exchange their earned Robux for fiat currency. Of such developers and creators, for the year ended December 31, 2024, over 17,000 developers and creators actually exchanged their earned Robux for fiat currency through our Developer Exchange Program.\nBusiness Model\nWhen users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of our experiences for free, although the business model for any given experience is ultimately up to its developer. Most free experiences allow users to spend Robux by purchasing experience-specific enhancements. Users can also use Robux to obtain items such as clothing, accessories, and emotes from our Marketplace or within an experience. Roblox retains a portion of every Robux transaction and distributes the rest to developers and creators. Robux can only be purchased from us at a price set by us, and can only be spent within our Platform. Robux have no monetary or intrinsic value outside of our Platform and can only be converted to fiat currency through our Developer Exchange Program. We are aware that some users seek to use unauthorized third-party websites to exchange Robux for fiat currency which is not permitted under our terms of use. We regularly monitor and screen usage of our Platform with the aim of identifying and preventing these activities, as well as regularly send cease-and desist letters to operators of third-party websites offering fraudulent Robux or digital goods offers.\nConsistent with our free to use business model, a small portion of our users have historically been payers. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2024, of our average 82.9 million DAUs, only approximately 1.0 million represented our average daily unique paying users. Similarly, in the year ended December 31, 2024, our average daily bookings per DAU was $0.14, whereas our average daily bookings per daily unique paying user was $11.48. We believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of users, including the number of users who may not purchase and spend Robux, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of users who choose to purchase and spend Robux will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall users.\nRoblox also allows developers, creators, and brands to reach their audiences by purchasing ads. Further, Roblox offers sponsored experiences and sponsored items, whereby developers and creators can pay to purchase ads to increase discoverability of their creations, which appear where experiences and items are discovered, including through search.\nHow Users Purchase Robux\nUsers can generally purchase Robux in two ways: as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service that is billed monthly and includes discounted Robux, access to exclusive in-experience benefits, exclusive and discounted marketplace items and the ability to buy, sell, and trade certain Avatar items. Roblox accepts payments through app stores, credit cards, and prepaid cards. The average price for a Robux for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.01.\nHow Developers and Creators Earn Robux\nRobux are considered “earned” if a developer or creator receives them as payments for a bona fide third-party transaction through the Roblox Platform. We offer developers and creators the following mechanisms to earn Robux:\n•sale of access to their experiences and enhancements in their experiences, which may be one-time or recurring;\n•Engagement-Based Payouts, which reward developers for the amount of time that Roblox Premium subscribers spend in their experiences;\n•generating impressions for ad units within their experiences and teleporting users to other experiences through ad portals; and\n•sale of Avatar items to users (through the Marketplace or directly within experiences).\nGenerally, as users purchase and subsequently spend Robux on Roblox, creators of the virtual item receive 30% of the Robux, the seller or distributor of the virtual item receives 40% of the Robux, and the Platform receives 30% of the Robux. Oftentimes, the creator of the virtual item is also the seller of that item. Creators that sell their own creations within their experiences receive 70% of the Robux spent, as they are acting both as the creator and the seller. Creators that make their virtual items available through the Marketplace receive 30% of the Robux spent, as Roblox is both the seller and the Platform for these transactions. As it relates to generating impressions for ads units and portals, developers earn Robux based on the number of impressions and teleports that occur within their experience.\nEarned Robux are deposited into the virtual accounts of the developers and creators, who can convert Robux into fiat currency at an exchange rate which is determined by Roblox in its sole discretion of 1 Robux to $0.0035 as of December 31, 2024, if they qualify for and are registered in our Developer Exchange Program. In order to be qualified for our Developer Exchange Program and eligible to exchange earned Robux for fiat currency, developers and creators must meet certain conditions, such as having earned the minimum amount of Robux required to qualify for the program, a verified developer account, and an account in good standing. On January 31, 2022, we reduced the minimum amount of earned Robux required to qualify for the program from 100,000 Robux to 50,000 Robux and subsequently on January 31, 2023, we further reduced the minimum requirement from 50,000 Robux to 30,000 Robux. We believe these reductions in the minimum amounts required incentivize our developer and creator community, and promote the long term growth and health of such community. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, over 24,500 and 16,500 developers and creators were qualified and registered in our Developer Exchange Program, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, developers and creators earned $922.8 million and $740.8 million, respectively.\nOur developers and creators do not always exchange their Robux into fiat currency. Some choose to purchase ad credits to promote their experiences on the Platform or spend the Robux as any other user would.\nOur Growth Strategies\nWe are continually innovating the Roblox Platform, including making significant investments in high fidelity avatars, more realistic experiences, AI tools, and other social features, as well as more diverse opportunities for monetization. We believe that these innovations have the potential to transform how people express themselves, socialize, communicate, play, learn, work, and transact together around the world. We are focused on the following key growth strategies:\n•Roblox Everywhere: We want to give users the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly across the most popular client devices. As of December 31, 2024, the Roblox Client operates on iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation, and VR hardware, such as Meta Quest, and supports VR experiences on PC. We believe the investments we are making will facilitate a high quality, intuitive experience for users across all devices, and enable developers and creators to publish once and instantly on all supported devices across a global audience.\n•Platform for Everyone: As we expand the diversity of content, experiences, and communications that people can have on Roblox, we believe there is significant potential to increase our penetration and engagement across all demographics. We ultimately aim to be a brand that serves everyone. We also look to continue expanding new verticals such as brand partnerships, education, and communication.\n•International Expansion: We believe there is significant potential for us to grow the global reach of our Platform. We believe some of that will occur by the same organic, word of mouth user, creator, and developer growth that we have seen in markets like the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we are investing in technology that will also enhance our growth around the world. For example, we believe that features such as automated translation and built-in regional compliance will enable us to scale usage in global markets, allowing developers to publish in multiple languages and allowing users to communicate with each other even when they speak different languages.\n•Vibrant Economy: We believe there is significant potential to increase monetization on our Platform and we are constantly investing in new ways to empower our developer and creator community. We are actively working on empowering our creator community through initiatives such as User-Generated Content (“UGC”) for all and dynamic price floors in the avatar marketplace. We are also supporting our developer community’s monetization efforts through in-experience price optimization recommendations, higher revenue shares for paid access experiences, and our Creator Affiliate Program. At the platform-level, we are continuously investing in our Search and Discovery algorithms to advance personalization and drive engagement and spending. Finally, we expect to continue working with leading brands to build unique commerce opportunities and help them reach their audiences at scale within Roblox experiences through immersive ads. Our immersive ads system is designed to be native to the experience in which it is placed and will provide unique commerce opportunities for brands on the Platform. Immersive ads also provide developers and creators with another monetization method on the Platform.\n•Gaming Market Expansion: We believe there is a strong potential to capture a greater percentage of global gaming revenue within the Roblox ecosystem. According to Newzoo’s 2024 Global Games Market Report, it is estimated that 3 billion people will have played games in 2024. We believe our UGC approach, combined with several key differentiators like personalized expressive avatars, a vibrant social graph, and immersive 3D communication provide a unique value proposition to make traditional gaming experiences more social and support new experiences unique to our Platform. Additionally, we continue to innovate behind the scenes to improve the raw performance, quality, and cost-to-serve efficiency of our core Platform, with the goal of making it as easy as possible for creators to build better experiences, including games, and reach more users. Within the traditional gaming ecosystem, we also have a tremendous opportunity to expand content into new genres. Today, genres such as Avatar Roleplay, Simulation, and Survival are popular on our Platform, and we want to help our creators grow into untapped areas of demand such as Shooter, Sports & Racing and RPG experiences.\nBrand and Marketing\nOur go-to-market approach is driven by the strength and continued enhancement of our brand, organic adoption across our user, creator and developer communities, and an influencer-based marketing strategy, with a goal to demonstrate the Platform’s wide-ranging appeal across demographics, geographies, and interests.\nUsers build a direct relationship with the Roblox brand by establishing an identity and creating their social graph. Users are able to navigate across an integrated universe of experiences on our Platform and engage on the Platform with other users in their social graph. We believe this approach helps to create a flywheel that brings new users to the Platform, and promotes loyalty and engagement.\nWe have millions of experiences to choose from on Roblox, and developers continue to build new experiences on the Platform and publish them daily. As experiences on the Platform grow in popularity, this success accrues to the Roblox brand and serves to draw in new audiences. Our approach is to amplify these experiences on both earned and owned channels which builds awareness and affinity for Roblox. This approach includes educating our creators, users, and brands on the Platform’s capabilities and innovations, all of which elevates each stakeholder’s experience.\nWe operate a highly efficient marketing model. Our approach is highly organic, with our user, creator and developer adoption driven by mutually reinforcing content and social network effects. We also leverage our influencer community to increase brand awareness and our reach across all age demographics. In 2024, we launched an Affiliate Program whereby influencers and creators can earn a share of Robux from purchases made by users they direct to Roblox.\nWe believe safety and civility is an integral and differentiating part of our brand. We have invested heavily in creating a safe and civil platform, which has allowed us to both grow and retain our user base.\nCompetition\nWe compete for both users, developers, and creators. We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention on the basis of our content and user experiences. We compete for users and their engagement hours with global technology leaders such as Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent, global entertainment companies such as Comcast, Disney, ViacomCBS, and Warner Bros Discovery, global gaming companies such as Activision Blizzard (now owned by Microsoft), Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Epic Games, Krafton, and Valve, online content platforms including Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, as well as social platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, X (formerly known as Twitter), Reddit, Discord, and Snap. We are able to compete for these users based on our variety of content, personalized user experience, and various engaging and social features.\nWe rely on developers and creators to create the content that leads to and maintains user engagement (including maintaining the quality of experiences). We compete to attract and retain developers and creators by providing them with the free tools to easily build, publish, operate, and monetize content. We compete for developers and creators and engineering talent with gaming platforms such as Epic Games, Unity, Meta Platforms, and Valve Corporation, who provide developers and creators the ability to create or distribute interactive content. We are able to compete for these developers and creators because of our comprehensive offering to build, publish, and operate experiences on our Platform, our free and easy-to-use technology, our broad user reach, our economic rewards system, our brand, our reputation for innovation, our developer and creator-centric culture, and our mission.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in monetization on our Platform and tend to generate higher levels of bookings in the fourth quarter of the year primarily due to the end-of-year holiday season. We also typically see higher levels of engagement in the months of June, July, and August, which are summer periods in the northern hemisphere, and lower levels of engagement in the post-summer months of September, October, and November. Other periods of seasonality include holidays such as Lunar New Year, Easter, and Ramadan, each of which may differ in timing year-over-year. While bookings are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, this trend may not be reflected in the revenue recognized in the same period due to the timing of our revenue recognition (see section “Revenue Recognition” within Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, for further discussion on the Company’s revenue recognition policy). These seasonal impacts may be more or less pronounced in the future or different altogether.\nSecurity, Privacy, Data Protection and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, security, rights of publicity, content regulation, intellectual property, use of AI, online safety, gambling, loot boxes, ratings, competition, protection of minors, including verified parental consent, consumer protection, communication, credit card processing, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country or state to state and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope expands. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. It is imperative that we secure the creative assets, performance and user data that are critical to our business. We devote considerable resources to our security program with the intent to continually improve our services and how we securely store and separate user assets. Our intent is to make it easy for our developers and creators to securely build and distribute their content on our Platform.\nWe rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act, and the fair-use doctrine in the U.S., and the Digital Services Act in the European Union (“EU”). However, each of these statutes and regulations are subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation, regulatory guidance and enforcement, and legislative amendments. In addition, pending or recently adopted legislation globally imposes additional obligations or liability on us associated with user behavior and content uploaded by users to our Platform, requires us to publish transparency reports, and requires us to carry out risk assessments and mitigate risks we identify. If the rules, doctrines or currently available defenses change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply protections similar to those that are currently available, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our service, we could be required to expend significant resources to try to comply with the new rules or incur liability, and our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed.\nWe are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including with respect to the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of the sale of personal information. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) became effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. California has also enacted the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act (“ADCA”), which originally was scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2024. The ADCA would have implemented into law certain principles taken from the U.K.’s Age Appropriate Design Code (“AADC”), which went into effect in September 2021, and imposed substantial new obligations upon companies that offer online services, products, or features “likely to be accessed” by children, defined under the ADCA as anyone under 18 years of age. Due to legal challenges, the ADCA has not yet gone into effect.\nIn addition, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, communication, content regulation, and other laws and regulations may be more restrictive and burdensome. For example, GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. Under GDPR, fines up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. In addition, the EU’s Digital Services Act (“DSA”), which became fully applicable on February 17, 2024 imposes new content moderation obligations, notice and transparency obligations, advertising restrictions and other requirements on digital platforms to protect consumers and their rights online. Noncompliance with the DSA could result in fines of up to 6% of annual global revenues, which are in addition to the ability of civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations to lodge class action lawsuits. The United Kingdom’s Online Safety Act (“OSA”) was enacted in October 2023 and will gradually be fully implemented as Ofcom publishes its guidance and codes of practice with the first set of obligations in force in March 2025. The OSA introduces, among other things, duties to protect children online, complete risk assessments, and remove illegal content. Noncompliance with the OSA could lead to investigations and other proceedings, substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of global revenues of the previous year and possible criminal liability on senior managers and company officers, and the imposition of business disruption measures such as access restriction orders. The evolving regulatory landscape internationally results in uncertainty and could require us to incur additional costs and expenses to comply.\nChildren’s privacy and online safety has also been a focus of recent enforcement activity and subjects our business to potential liability that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in the U.S. have in recent years increased enforcement of relevant legal frameworks, including COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. The FTC released final amendments to its Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA Rule”) on January 16, 2025, that, among other things, expand the scope of covered information, provide for revised notices, and impose new data retention and information security obligations. Following an executive order that froze all then-pending federal regulations as of January 20, 2025, the amended COPPA Rule is pending further review and may be subject to additional modifications. In addition, GDPR prohibits certain processing of personal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on the country) without parental consent. The CCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California under the age of 16 (or parental consent for children under the age of 13) before selling their personal information. Also, actual or perceived noncompliance with the AADC may result in audits or other proceedings by the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner Office, the body set up to uphold information rights in the United Kingdom, and other regulators in the EEA or Switzerland, as noncompliance with the AADC may indicate noncompliance with applicable data protection law. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, we may in the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ADCA, the AADC, DSA and OSA or other laws or actual or asserted obligations relating to children’s privacy. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us if enacted in the future.\nWe take a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other measures designed to protect our data, including data pertaining to our users, employees and business partners. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data.\nNon-compliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident or as the result of a regulatory investigation. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGovernment authorities outside the U.S. may also seek to restrict access to or block our Platform, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our Platform or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our Platform in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content. Our privacy policy and terms and conditions of use describe our practices concerning, the use, transmission, and disclosure of user information and are posted on our website.\nFor additional information, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If the security of our Platform is compromised, it could compromise our and our developers’, creators’, and users’ private information, disrupt our internal operations, and harm public perception of our Platform, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Some developers, creators, and users on our Platform may make unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal use of Robux and other digital goods or experiences on our Platform, including through unauthorized third-party websites or “cheating” programs,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulations—Because we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could significantly harm our business.”\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our success depends in part on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, contractual provisions, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our intellectual property.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned more than 180 U.S. patents relating to aspects of our actual or contemplated operations and technologies. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2043. We also had more than 260 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. There can be no assurance that each of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. In addition, any resulting issued patents may have claims narrower than those in our patent applications. We seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection; however, we are not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business.\nWe have registered “Roblox,” “Robux,” and our corporate logo as trademarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In total (including our subsidiary entities), we are the owner of over 460 trademark filings and have over 20 trademark applications in the U.S. and foreign countries as of December 31, 2024. There can be no assurance that each of our trademark applications will result in the issuance of a trademark or that each resulting trademark registration will be able to be maintained. As of December 31, 2024, we were the registered holder of over 790 domestic and international domain names. We continually monitor the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and in certain locations outside the U.S.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient protection for or successfully enforce our intellectual property. Any current and future patents, trademarks and other intellectual property or other proprietary rights we own or license, or otherwise have a right to use, may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid. Our existing and future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages, distinguish our products from those of our competitors or prevent competitors from launching comparable products. We may also be dependent on third-party content, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business. Further, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting or otherwise misappropriating or violating our intellectual property rights, and we may face challenges to the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We cannot guarantee that our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the rights of third parties. We expect to continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors and “non-practicing entities,” that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. While we do not anticipate that these allegations, if they were to result in litigation against us, would have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results, there can be no guarantee that such lawsuits would not have a materially adverse impact on us. Further, certain federal statutes in the U.S. may apply to us with respect to various activities of our users, including the DMCA, provide immunity from monetary damages for online service providers such as us from, among other things, infringing content uploaded to our Platform by our users provided we comply with certain statutory requirements. The immunity is part of a statutory safe harbor. To enjoy the benefits of the safe harbor and be immune from monetary damages for infringing content uploaded by our users, we have to register a designated agent with the U.S. Copyright Office and maintain that filing on a periodic basis with the U.S. Copyright Office. We must also expeditiously remove any infringing content upon acquiring actual knowledge of such infringement or, in the absence of actual knowledge, if we become aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. We must also adopt, reasonably implement, and inform users of our Platform about a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of users who are repeat infringers of the copyrights of third parties. If we fail to comply with the conditions for qualifying for safe harbor protection, we may be subject to monetary damages for infringing content on our Platform. The damages for copyright infringement can range from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed and, in the case of willful infringement, up to $150,000 per work infringed. Alternatively, copyright owners could seek to recover their actual damages and our profits. As we host millions of user uploaded works, we could be subject to significant damages claims if we are determined not to comply with the DMCA safe harbors. Intellectual property disputes are common in our sector, and, as we face increasing competition or grow our business, there is an ongoing risk that we may become involved in legal disputes involving intellectual property claims. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our intellectual property.\nFor additional information on risks relating to intellectual property, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, the activities of our users, or the content of the experiences on our Platform could subject us to liability and harm our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement would harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—We use open source software as part of, and in connection with certain experiences on, our Platform, which may pose particular intellectual property and security risks to and could have a negative impact on our business.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed 2,474 full time employees. In addition, we had thousands of trust & safety agents across the globe. In order to continue to evolve the Roblox Platform, we must continue to invest in attracting and retaining key talent, especially those focused on product and engineering. We monitor our progress with human capital metrics such as turnover, time to fill open roles, ratio of internally developed talent to external hires, ratio of technical talent to overall employees, and employee engagement. Our brand, market position, reputation for innovation, and developer and creator-centric culture support our ability to recruit best-in-class engineering talent. As of December 31, 2024, we had over 1,800 employees in product and engineering functions, accounting for approximately 77% of our total full time employees, and over 100 of our full time employees were located outside of the U.S.\nWe completed the Company’s return-to-office (“RTO”) plan in the summer of 2024, which required a subset of the Company’s remote employees to begin working from our San Mateo headquarters for three days a week in an effort to further promote engaging, collaborative, and productive team environments.\nWe have embraced four core values since we founded Roblox and focus on incorporating them into our daily actions:\n•Respect the Community. We consider our impact on the world, strive to respect everyone’s best interests, and communicate authentically. We prioritize community before company, company before team, and team before individual.\n•We are Responsible. We are responsible for both the intended and unintended consequences of our actions.\n•Take the Long View. We set a long term vision, even when making short term decisions. Challenge the status quo, think big, and look for innovation in whatever we do.\n•Get Stuff Done. We drive execution by taking initiative and relentlessly iterating towards the long term goal.\nTo help focus our core values and to promote and support fairness, belonging and diversity, we have established several affinity groups. Our affinity groups are inclusive, voluntary, and employee-led whose aim is to promote inclusion at the Company and allow networking, mentorships, and other opportunities for professional and personal development. They include groups for women, racial and ethnic minorities, and people who identify as LGBTQIA+.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in 2004.

You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nRisk Factors Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our Class A common stock speculative or risky:\n•We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n•Our business is affected by seasonal demands, and our financial condition and results of operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our financial results difficult to predict and may not fully reflect our underlying performance.\n•If our business becomes constrained by changing legal and regulatory requirements, including with respect to online safety, privacy, cybersecurity and data protection, AI, online platform liability, communication, verifiable parental consent and user-generated content, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees in the US or other jurisdictions in which we operate, our operating results will suffer.\n•We experienced rapid growth in prior periods and our prior growth may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.\n•We depend on effectively operating with third-party operating systems, hardware, and networks that we do not control; changes to any of these or our Platform may significantly harm our user retention, growth, engagement, and monetization, or require us to change our data collection and privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection practices, business models, operations, practices, advertising activities or application content, which could restrict our ability to maintain our Platform through these systems, hardware, and networks and would adversely impact our business.\n•The success of our business model is contingent upon our ability to provide a safe online environment for our users, many of whom are children, to experience and if we are not able to provide such an environment, our business will suffer dramatically.\n•If we are not able to provide sufficiently reliable services to our developers, creators, and users and maintain the performance of our Platform in the event of outages, constraints, disruptions, degradations or regulatory actions in our services and our Platform, our business and reputation will suffer.\n•If the security of our Platform is compromised, it could compromise our and our developers’, creators’, and users’ private information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our Platform, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n•Because we recognize revenue from bookings over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user or as the virtual items are consumed, changes in our business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\n•We may incur liability as a result of content published using our Platform or as a result of claims related to content generated by our developers, creators, and users, including copyright infringement, and legislation regulating content on our Platform may require us to change our Platform or business practices.\n•We must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in very competitive markets to support out growth, and the loss of one or more of the members of our senior management team or other key personnel (or the inability to attract senior management or other key personnel) could significantly harm our business.\n•The public trading price of our Class A common stock is volatile and may decline.\n•The dual class stock structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control in our Founder, which may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction.\n•Securities or industry analysts or other third parties may publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market which may cause the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of $935.4 million, $1,151.9 million and $924.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,995.6 million. We also expect our operating expenses to continue to increase, and if our growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. We expect our costs and investments to continue to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make investments to grow our business, including an expected increase in infrastructure and stock-based compensation expenses. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a public company. Compliance with these rules and regulations continues to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and demand on our systems, and requires significant attention from our senior management that could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nOur business is affected by seasonal demands, and our financial condition and results of operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our financial results difficult to predict and may not fully reflect our underlying performance.\nHistorically, our business has been highly seasonal, with the highest percentage of our bookings occurring in the fourth quarter when holidays permit our users to spend increased time on our Platform and lead to increased spend on pre-paid Robux gift cards, and we expect this trend to continue. We also typically see higher levels of engagement in the months of June, July, and August, which are summer periods in the northern hemisphere, and lower levels of engagement in the post-summer months of September, October, and November. Other periods of seasonality include holidays such as Lunar New Year, Easter, and Ramadan, each of which may differ in timing year over year and therefore have impacted and may continue to impact our quarterly results. We may also experience fluctuations due to factors that may be outside of our control that affect user, developer, or creator engagement with our Platform.\nAccordingly, our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future, both based on the seasonality of our business as well as external factors impacting the global economy, our industry and our company. Our results of operations and financial condition in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including, but not limited to: our ability to maintain and grow our user base, user engagement, developer base and developer engagement; the level of demand for our Platform; the ability of our developers to monetize their experiences; increased competition; our pricing model including any discounts that we offer; the maturation of our business; our ability to introduce new revenue streams such as advertising; legislative or regulatory changes; macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments, and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to maintain operating margins, cash used in operating activities, and free cash flow; system failures or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents relating to privacy or cybersecurity; adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation and dispute-related costs; adverse media coverage or unfavorable publicity; the effectiveness of our internal control over financial metric reporting; the amount and timing of our stock-based compensation expenses; changes in our effective tax rate; and changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles. As a result, you should not rely on our past quarterly results of operations as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving market segments.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, many of which are unsettled and still developing, which could increase our costs or adversely affect our business, including preventing our ability to operate our Platform in certain jurisdictions.\nAs a global platform with users, developers and creators in over 170 countries, we are subject to a myriad of laws and regulations that affect our business, including but not limited to, laws and regulations regarding online gaming, online safety, online platform liability, content moderation, intellectual property ownership and infringement, consumer protection, protection of minors, including the use of verifiable parental consent, privacy, biometrics, cybersecurity, data protection and data localization requirements, the use of prepaid cards, subscriptions, advertising, electronic marketing, AI, anti-competition, freedom of speech, labor, real estate, taxation, escheatment, export and national security, tariffs, anti-corruption, campaign finance, gambling, loot boxes, ratings and telecommunications, all of which are continuously evolving and developing. We have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot assure you that we will not experience violations of such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nThe widespread availability of 3D user-generated content online is relatively new, and the regulatory framework is new and continuously evolving with increased legislative initiatives and agency focus on areas including the protection of minors online and users’ personal information, among other areas. The scope and interpretation of these laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and compliance with laws, regulations and similar requirements may be burdensome and expensive. Moreover, in some cases these new regulations can be enforced by private parties in addition to governmental agencies. \nThere are a suite of global laws focusing on the area of online safety and content moderation, including notice and transparency obligations. The United Kingdom’s Online Safety Act (“OSA”) will gradually be fully implemented as the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”) publishes its guidance and codes of practice with the first set of obligations in force in March 2025. The OSA introduces, among other things, duties to protect children and other users online, complete risk assessments, and remove illegal content. Noncompliance with the OSA could lead to investigations and other proceedings, substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of the prior year’s global revenues and possible imposition of criminal liability on senior managers and company officers, and the imposition of business disruption measures such as access restriction orders. The EU’s Digital Services Act (“DSA”) imposes new content moderation obligations, notice and transparency obligations, advertising restrictions and other requirements on digital platforms to protect consumers and their rights online. Noncompliance with the DSA could result in fines of up to 6% of annual global revenues, which are in addition to the ability of civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations to commence class action lawsuits. Australia’s Online Safety Act of 2021 has recently been amended to require certain social media platforms, which may include our Platform, take reasonable steps by the end of 2025 to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from having accounts.\nAdditionally, we are subject to regulations with respect to advertising, in particular, advertising to minors, and advertising regulations could differ based on the jurisdiction of a user. For example, in the U.S. the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other regulators restrict deceptive or unfair commercial activities, including in relation to targeted advertising and advertising to minors. As we evolve our advertising products, we may not be able to implement an advertising model that is compliant with regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate, and advertising regulations could differ based on the jurisdiction of our users.\nIn the U.S. we are subject to both federal and state legislative initiatives and regulations, such as the proposed Kids Online Safety Act and various state safety regulations, which have and may continue to vary significantly. For example, in 2024 the State of Texas enacted new restrictions on purchasing by minors, including requiring verified parental consent for minors to purchase digital items, including on our Platform. These additional restrictions will likely have an adverse impact on our revenue and bookings from users in Texas in the near term.\nIn addition, there are ongoing academic, political, and regulatory discussions in the U.S., Canada, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia and other jurisdictions regarding whether certain mechanisms that may be included in experiences on our Platform, such as features commonly referred to as “loot boxes,” and certain genres of experiences, such as social casino, that may reward gambling-like behavior, should be subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other genres of experiences to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction, and, if so, what such regulation should include. In some countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, “loot box” mechanics may be considered gambling, and are restricted as a result. In Australia gaming content containing “loot boxes” requires a mature age rating (age 15+). Other jurisdictions are considering similar limitations or bans on “loot boxes.”\nGovernmental agencies in any of the countries in which we, our users, developers, or creators are located from time to time have sought and continue to seek to and could in the future seek to impose restrictions on our Platform, our website, operating system platforms, application stores or the internet generally. Compliance with these existing and new regulations, uncertainty over changes in laws and regulations, uncertainty over the scope and interpretation of laws and regulations that may be applicable to us, and conflicting laws and obligations, have led to, and will continue to lead to increases in the cost of compliance, moderation and doing business and exposes us to possible litigation, fines or other injunctive and monetary penalties. We have been required to and could in the future be required to modify or remove certain content in the experiences on our Platform, change the default settings of our Platform, and modify or disable certain features on our Platform in various jurisdictions. These requirements may impact user engagement, the functionality and effectiveness of our Platform, our ability to operate across demographics and geographies, our developer’s ability to monetize their experiences in some geographies and reduce the overall use or demand for our Platform, which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have been required to and could in the future be required to change our business model for specific jurisdictions or subsets of our users, take on more onerous obligations, including, but not limited to, applying for government-issued licenses to operate, establishing a local presence in certain jurisdictions, developing localized product offerings, and storing user information on servers in a country within which we operate. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these laws, regulations, standards, and obligations, could be prohibitively expensive. Requirements to change age ratings of our Platform or of specific content on our Platform may make our Platform less attractive for the younger users and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any inability to adequately address these burdens, has led to, and in the future could lead to suspension of our Platform in certain jurisdictions. Restrictions on our ability to offer our Platform or on users’ ability to engage with others on our Platform may have a significant adverse impact on the revenue and bookings that we derive from those jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and our business. We may be required to expend substantial resources or to modify our Platform substantially to comply with evolving laws and regulations, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nMoreover, the adoption of any laws or regulations adversely affecting the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our Platform and increase our operating costs. The legislative and regulatory landscape regarding the regulation of the internet and, in particular, internet neutrality, in the U.S and internationally is subject to uncertainty. Users generally need to access the internet, including in geographically diverse areas, and also mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, to engage with experiences on our Platform. If governmental or other entities block, limit or otherwise restrict developers, creators, and users from accessing our Platform, or users from engaging with experiences on our Platform, we may need to take on more onerous obligations, limit the functionality of our Platform, and/or establish certain local entities, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations or subject us to additional fines and penalties.\nWe experienced rapid growth in prior periods, and our prior growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.\nWe experienced rapid growth in prior periods relative to our quarterly forecast and historic trends, which may not be indicative of our financial and operating results in future periods. The activity levels experienced in prior periods were attributed in part to the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2022, which led to increased demand for our business, were not sustainable, and our growth rates have moderated in most markets. The long-term impact to our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020, while our bookings increased 24% from the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2024. Our revenue, bookings, and user base growth rates have slowed and may continue to slow, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against historical periods. We believe our overall market acceptance, revenue growth, and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, some of which are not within our control. There can be no assurance that users will not reduce their usage or engagement with our Platform or reduce their discretionary spending on our Platform, which would adversely impact our revenue and financial condition. If we are unable to continue to maintain the attractiveness of our Platform to developers, creators, and users, they may no longer seek new experiences in our Platform, which would result in decreased market acceptance, fewer bookings, and lower revenue and could harm our operations.\nWe depend on effectively operating with third-party operating systems, hardware, and networks that may make changes affecting our operating costs, as well as our ability to maintain our Platform which would hurt our ability to operate our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, 30% of our revenue was attributable to Robux sales through the Apple App Store and 16% of our revenue was attributable to Robux sales through the Google Play Store. Because of the significant use of our Platform on mobile devices, our application must remain interoperable with these and other popular mobile app stores and platforms, and related hardware. We are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of these operating systems, as well as policies and terms of service of the various software application stores that make our application and experiences available to our developers, creators, and users. These policies and terms of service govern the availability, promotion, distribution, content, and operation of applications and experiences on such operating systems and stores. Each provider of these operating systems and stores has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and policies with respect to our Platform and those changes may be unfavorable to us and our developers’, creators’, and users’ use of our Platform. If an operating system provider or application store limits or discontinues access to, or changes the terms governing, its operating system or store for any reason, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, an operating system provider or application store could also limit or discontinue our access to its operating system or store if it establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors, launches a competing product itself, or it otherwise determines that it is in its business interests to do so. If competitors control the operating systems and related hardware our application runs on, they could make interoperability of our Platform more difficult or display their competitive offerings more prominently than ours. There is no guarantee that new devices, platforms, systems and software application stores will continue to support our Platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these new systems. If it becomes more difficult for our users, developers or creators to access and engage with our Platform, our business and user retention, growth, and engagement could be significantly harmed.\nSimilarly, at any time, our operating system providers or application stores can change their policies on how we operate on their operating system or in their application stores by, for example, applying content moderation for applications and advertising or imposing technical or code requirements. These actions by operating system providers or application stores may affect our ability to collect, process, and use data as desired and could negatively impact our ability to leverage data about the experiences our developers create which in turn could impact our resource planning and feature development planning for our Platform.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels and third-party payment processors to facilitate purchases by our Platform users. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such providers, if their terms and conditions change, or fail to process or ensure the safety of users’ payments, our business will suffer.\nPurchases of Robux and other products (e.g., prepaid gift cards) or services on our Platform are facilitated through third-party online distribution channels and third-party payment processors. We utilize these distribution channels, such as Amazon, Apple, Blackhawk, ePay, Google, Incomm, PayPal, Stripe, Microsoft, Sony’s PlayStation Network and Xsolla, to receive cash proceeds from purchases of Robux. For our experiences accessed through mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and consoles, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from in-game sales with the platform and console providers. For operations through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, we are obligated to pay up to 30% of any money paid by users on our Platform to Apple and Google and this amount could increase. For operations through console providers, such as Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation, we are obligated to pay around 30% of any money paid by users on our Platform, and these amounts could also increase. These costs are expected to remain a significant operating expense for the foreseeable future. If the amount these platform providers charge increases, it could have a material impact on our ability to pay developers and our results of operations. Each provider of an operating system, application store or console may also change its fee structure or add fees associated with access to and use of its operating system, which could have an adverse impact on our business. There has been litigation, as well as governmental inquiries over application store fees, and Apple or Google could modify their platform in response to such litigation and inquiries in a manner that may harm us. Any scheduled or unscheduled interruption in the ability of our users to transact with these distribution channels could adversely affect our payment collection and, in turn, our revenue and bookings.\nAdditionally, we do not directly process purchases made on our Platform or the exchange of earned Robux for fiat currency through our Developer Exchange Program. Information on those purchases or exchanges (e.g., debit and credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information, and billing addresses) is disclosed to the third-party online platform and service providers facilitating purchases or exchanges of Robux for fiat currency by users (such as Stripe, Xsolla, and Tipalti). We do not have control over the security measures of those providers, and their security measures may not be adequate. We could be exposed to litigation and possible liability if our users’ (including our developers’) transaction information involving their purchases or exchanges for fiat currency are compromised, which could harm our reputation and our ability to attract users and may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe also rely on the stability of such distribution channels and their payment transmissions, and third-party payment processors for the continued payment services provided to our users. If any of these providers fail to process or ensure the security of users’ payments for any reason, our reputation may be damaged and we may lose our paying users and developers interested in our Developer Exchange Program, developers may be discouraged from creating on our Platform, and users may be discouraged from making purchases on our Platform in the future, which, in turn, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nIn addition, from time to time, we or our partners encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our Platform services. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our users’ card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business. Further, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has issued a regulation to exercise authority to conduct supervisory examinations over large nonbank technology companies offering digital funds transfer and payment wallet apps. Accordingly, the third-party online distribution channels and third-party payment processors on which we rely, to the extent they are covered by the CFPB’s regulation, may face external pressures that could impose additional compliance costs, impact their ability to offer digital payment services, and affect our relationships with them over time or have other adverse impacts upon our business and our ability to serve users and developers.\nThe success of our business model is contingent upon maintaining a strong reputation and brand, including our ability to provide a safe online environment for our users, many of whom are children, to experience, and if we are not able to provide such an environment, our business will suffer dramatically.\nOur Platform hosts a number of experiences intended for audiences of varying ages, a significant percentage of which are designed to be experienced by children. As a user-generated content platform, it is relatively easy for developers, creators, and users to upload content that can be viewed broadly. We continue to make significant efforts to provide a safe, civil and enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Although illicit activities are in violation of our terms and policies, and we attempt to block objectionable material and ban bad actors from our Platform, we are unable to prevent all such violations from occurring and banned actors have, at times, been able to evade our detection systems and regain access to our Platform through alternative accounts. \nWe invest significant technical and human resources to prevent inappropriate content on our Platform by using a range of tools and policies, including several designed to review all images, audio, and video at the time of upload in order to block inappropriate content before users have a chance to encounter it on our Platform. Notwithstanding our efforts, from time to time, inappropriate content is successfully uploaded onto our Platform and can be viewed by others prior to being identified and removed by us. Additionally, in some of our experiences users are able to generate in-experience content which may not be detectable by our automated moderation systems.\nMoreover, measures intended to make our Platform more attractive to an older, age verified audience, such as less highly moderated or unmoderated chat and the introduction of experiences with mature content, and new methods of communication could fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by its intended audience and may create the perception that our Platform is not safe for younger users. This in turn has caused and may continue to cause some operating system providers, application stores, or regulatory agencies to require a higher age rating for our Platform, which could cause us to become less available to younger users and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, USK, who are responsible for game ratings in Germany, increased our age rating from USK12 to USK16 in January 2025. We have at times experienced negative media coverage related to content that is age-restricted on our Platform but is mischaracterized in the media as being accessible to younger users and therefore has impacted our reputation as a safe online environment for children. At times, content that is age-restricted, but not violative of our terms for teenagers, may still be in poor taste or considered crude, and therefore lead to negative media attention.\nFurther, children may attempt to evade our age verification system, which could lead them to be exposed to inappropriate content or behavior by participating in experiences that are not age-appropriate or gaining access to features we have restricted to older users. While we have introduced Content Maturity Labels that enable users to make informed decisions about the experiences they interact with and we have introduced additional parental controls that help parents and caregivers manage their child’s experience on our Platform, users from time to time, notwithstanding our efforts, have been able to evade our systems, and have been exposed to content that may not be age-appropriate. In addition, as more of our brand partners, developers, and creators offer physical products for sale through our Platform, younger users may be able to purchase products that may not be age-appropriate. Unintentional access to content or physical products could cause harm to our audience and to our reputation of providing a safe environment for younger users. If we are unable to sufficiently limit, or are perceived as not being able to sufficiently limit, all or substantially all age-inappropriate content and physical products to only users who have been verified as being the appropriate age for such content or goods, then parents and children could lose their trust in the safety of our Platform, which would harm our overall acceptance by these audiences and would likely result in significantly reduced revenue, bookings, profitability, and ultimately, our ability to continue to successfully operate our Platform.\nIn addition to limiting content to age-appropriate audiences and blocking other inappropriate content, we have statutory obligations under U.S. federal law to block or remove child pornography and report apparent offenses to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. While we have dedicated technology and trained human moderator staff that can detect and remove sexual content involving children, there have been instances where such content has been uploaded, and any unforeseen future non-compliance by us or allegations of non-compliance by us with respect to U.S. federal laws on child pornography or the sexual exploitation of children could significantly harm our reputation, create criminal liability, and could be costly and time consuming to address or defend. We may also be subject to additional criminal liability related to child pornography or child sexual exploitation under other domestic and international laws and regulations.\nWe believe that maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand is critical to grow the number of developers, creators, and users on our Platform, especially given the safe and civil atmosphere that we strive to achieve for our users, many of whom are children. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide reliable high-quality, engaging, and shared experiences on our Platform. If users, developers, or creators do not perceive our Platform to be reliable or of high quality, the value of our brand could diminish, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our Platform. Further, we have faced and are currently defending allegations that our Platform has been used by criminal offenders to identify and communicate with children and to possibly entice them to interact off-Platform, outside of the restrictions of our moderated chat, content blockers, and other on-Platform safety measures. While we devote considerable resources to prevent this from occurring, we are unable to prevent all such interactions from taking place. We have also received and expect to continue to receive a high degree of media coverage alleging the use of our Platform for illicit or objectionable ends. For example, we have experienced negative media publicity from traditional media sources and self-described short seller investors, related to the age of some of our developers, the content that developers produce, our operating metrics and disclosures, the strength of our moderation practices, and the conduct of users on our Platform that may be deemed illicit, explicit, profane, or otherwise objectionable. Additional unfavorable publicity has covered our privacy, cybersecurity or data protection practices, terms of service, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, our use of generative AI, the actions of our users, and the actions of our developers or creators whose products are integrated with our Platform.\nOur reputation and brand could also be negatively affected by the actions of developers, contractors and users that are hostile, inappropriate, or illegal, whether on or off our Platform. Actual or perceived incidents or misuses of user data or other privacy or security incidents, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, the quality, integrity, characterization and age-appropriateness of content shared on our Platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, have and could adversely affect our reputation and lead to scrutiny and inquiries from governments and regulators. Any criminal incidents or allegations involving Roblox, whether or not we are directly responsible, could adversely affect our reputation as a safe place for children and hurt our business. Any negative publicity could create the perception that we do not provide a safe online environment and may have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our developer, creator, and user community, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful.\nIf we fail to retain users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our Platform, revenue, bookings, and operating results will be harmed.\nWe view DAUs as a critical measure of our user engagement, and adding, maintaining, and engaging users has been and will continue to be necessary to our continued growth. Our DAU growth rate has fluctuated in the past and may slow in the future due to various factors including: the introduction of new or updated experiences or virtual items on our Platform; our ability to personalize and feature relevant experiences to our users; performance issues with our Platform; the removal of popular experiences or virtual items on our Platform including due to copyright or other legal violations that may or may not be within our control; the availability of our Platform across markets and user demographics, which may be impacted by regulatory or legal requirements, including the use of verifiable parental consent; changes to the default settings on our Platform overall or for specific user groups; higher market penetration rates and competition from a variety of entertainment sources for our users and their time. In addition, our strategy seeks to expand the age groups and geographic markets that make up our users. If and when we achieve maximum market penetration rates among any particular user cohort overall and in particular geographic markets, future growth in DAUs will need to come from other age or geographic cohorts, which may be difficult, costly, or time consuming for us to achieve. Accessibility to the internet and bandwidth or connectivity limitations as well as regulatory requirements, may also affect our ability to further expand our user base in a variety of geographies. If the growth rate in our key metrics such as DAUs or hours engaged slows or becomes stagnant, or we have a decline in one of our key metrics such as DAUs or hours engaged, or we fail to effectively monetize new or existing users, our financial performance could be significantly harmed.\nOur business plan assumes that the demand for interactive entertainment offerings will increase for the foreseeable future. However, if this market shrinks or grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for our Platform does not grow as quickly as we anticipate, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, budgetary constraints of our developers, creators, and users, technological changes, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical or regulatory environments or other factors, we may not be able to increase our revenue and bookings sufficiently to ever achieve profitability and our stock price would decline.\nMoreover, a large number of our users are under the age of 13. This demographic may be less brand loyal and more likely to follow trends, including viral trends, than other demographics. These and other factors may lead users to switch to another entertainment option rapidly, which can interfere with our ability to forecast usage or DAUs and would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement. We also may not be able to penetrate other demographics in a meaningful manner to compensate for the loss of DAUs in this age group. Falling user retention, growth, or engagement rates could seriously harm our business.\nWe depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and if we fail to properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop and monetize content, our business will suffer.\nOur Platform relies on our developers and creators to create experiences and virtual items on our Platform for our users, and we believe the interactions between and within the developer, creator, and user communities on our Platform create a thriving and organic ecosystem, and this network effect drives our growth. To facilitate and incentivize the creation of experiences and virtual items by developers, our Platform offers developers an opportunity to earn Robux, a virtual currency on our Platform, which, as described in our terms of use, is a license to engage in experiences and/or obtain virtual items. When virtual items are acquired on our Platform, the originating developer or creator earns a portion of the Robux paid for the item. Developers are able to exchange their accumulated earned Robux for fiat currency under certain conditions outlined in our Developer Exchange Program. In addition, we have paid access experiences where developers can offer access to their experiences to users for a set price in fiat currency and in exchange earn a higher revenue share of these user purchases. While we have millions of developers and creators on our Platform, 50% of in-experience hours engaged in experiences were spent in the top 50 experiences in the month ending December 31, 2024. We continuously review and revise our Platform policies to enhance regulatory compliance and the trust and safety of our Platform. Changes to our Platform policies may reduce the ability of developers to monetize their experience. The loss of any of our top developers could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operations. If we fail to provide a sufficient return to developers, they may elect to develop user-generated content on other platforms, which would result in a loss of revenue.\nWe spend substantial amounts of time and money to research, develop, and enhance versions of our Platform to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or other enhancements and prioritize user safety and security in order to meet the rapidly evolving demands of our developers, creators, and users. Developments and innovations on our Platform may rely on new or evolving technologies which may at times be still in development and may never be fully developed. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. Despite our efforts, users, developers, or creators may become dissatisfied with our Platform technology, billing or payment policies, our handling of personal data, or other aspects of our Platform. If we fail to adequately address these or other user, developer, or creator complaints, negative publicity about us or our Platform could diminish confidence in and the use of our Platform. If we do not provide the right technologies, education or financial incentives to our developers and creators, they may develop fewer experiences or virtual items or be unable to or choose not to monetize their experiences, and our users may elect to not participate in the experiences or acquire the virtual items, and, thus, our Platform, revenue, and bookings could be adversely affected. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate developers’ and creators’ needs, the quality of the content they create may not attract users to engage with experiences and result in a decline of users on our Platform. When we develop new or enhanced features for our Platform, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to develop, market, promote, and sell new features, and we may not be able to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of these investments.\nIf we experience outages, constraints, disruptions, or degradations in our services, Platform support and/or technological infrastructure, our ability to provide sufficiently reliable services to our customers and maintain the performance of our Platform could be negatively impacted, which could harm our relationships with our developers, creators, and users, and, consequently, our business.\nOur users expect fast, reliable, and resilient systems to enhance their experience and support their activity on our Platform, which depends on the continuing operation and availability of our Platform from our global network of data centers controlled and operated by us and our external service providers, including third-party “cloud” computing services. We also provide services to our developer and creator community through our Platform, including DevForum and Creator Hub for tutorials, hosting, customer service, regulatory compliance, and translation, among many others. The experiences and technologies on our Platform are complex software products and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these experiences and technologies is expensive and complex. The reliable delivery and stability of our Platform has been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by outages, disruptions, failures, or degradations in our network and related infrastructure or those of our partners or service providers, including those stemming from vulnerabilities in authentication mechanism, service spoofing, or the complexities of managing micro-systems architecture.\nWe have experienced outages from time to time since our inception when the Platform is unavailable for all or some of our users, developers, and creators, including in October 2024, May 2022, October 2021, and at other times during our history. In addition, there may be times when access to our Platform for users, developers, and creators may be temporarily unavailable or limited. This could be due to proactive actions we take while we provide critical updates or as an unexpected outcome of routine maintenance, which most recently occurred in July 2023. Outages can be caused by a number of factors, including a move to a new technology or security vulnerabilities in new or existing technologies, the demand on our Platform exceeding the capabilities of our technological infrastructure, delays or failures resulting from natural disasters, manmade disasters, or other catastrophic events, the migration of data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments, a cyber event or act of terrorism, and issues relating to our reliance on third-party software, third-party application stores, and third parties that host our Platform in areas where we do not operate our own data centers. The unavailability of our Platform, particularly if outages should become more frequent or longer in duration, could cause our users to seek other entertainment options, including those provided by our competitors, which may adversely affect our financial results. If we or our partners or third party service providers experience outages and our Platform is unavailable or if our developers, creators, and users are unable to access our Platform within a reasonable amount of time or at all, as a result of any such events, our reputation and brand may be harmed, developer, creator and user engagement with our Platform may be reduced, and our revenue, bookings and profitability could be, and has been in the past, negatively impacted. We may also experience a negative impact to our financial results as a result of decreased usage on our Platform or decrease of payouts to developers and creators. We may not have full redundancy for all of our systems at all times and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by technological exploitation used by threat actors and to address all aspects of any consequence or incident or allow us to maintain business continuity at profitable levels or at all. Further, in the event of damage or service interruption, our business interruption insurance policies will not adequately compensate us for losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenues, subject us to liability, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition to the events described above, our data and our technological infrastructure may also be subject to government laws, administrative actions or regulations, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and litigation that could stop, limit, or delay operations. Despite a reliability program focused on anticipating and solving issues that may impact the availability of our Platform and precautions taken at our data centers, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a cyber event or act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, our inability to secure additional or replacement data center capacity as needed, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in interruptions or delays on our Platform, impede our ability to scale our operations or have other adverse impacts upon our business and adversely impact our ability to serve our developers, creators, and users.\nCustomer support personnel and technologies are critical to resolve issues and to allow developers, creators, and users to realize the full benefits that our Platform provides and provide an excellent customer experience. High-quality support is important for the retention of our existing developers, creators, and users and to encourage the expansion of their use of our Platform. We rely on third party service providers to assist in our customer support. Our third party providers, employees, developers or users have been and may in the future be a source of exploitation for bad actors to attempt to compromise our systems and information. If a threat actor is successful in using one or more of our third party service providers, employees, developers, or users to compromise our systems or personal information of our users, it could impact our business and results of operation as well as our reputation.\nWe must continue to invest in the infrastructure required to support our Platform. If we do not help our developers, creators, and users quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our Platform to existing and new developers, creators, and users could suffer. In addition, if we do not make sufficient investments in servers, software or personnel in support of our infrastructure, to scale effectively and accommodate increased demands placed on our infrastructure, the reliability of our underlying infrastructure will be harmed and our ability to provide a quality experience for our developers, creators, and users will be significantly harmed. This would lead to a reduction in the number of developers, creators, and users on our Platform, a reduction in our revenues, bookings, and ability to compete, and our reputation with existing or potential developers, creators, or users could suffer.\nThe lack of comprehensive encryption for communications on our Platform may increase the impact of a security breach or incident.\nCommunications on our Platform are not comprehensively encrypted at this time. As such, any security breach or incident that involves unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, or use of communications on our Platform may be particularly impactful to our business. We may experience greater incident response forensics, data recovery, legal fees, and costs of notification related to any such potential incident or vulnerabilities, and we may face an increased risk of reputational harm, regulatory enforcement, and consumer litigation, which could further harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future business opportunities.\nIf the security of our Platform is compromised, it could compromise our and our developers’, creators’, and users’ private information, disrupt our internal operations, and harm public perception of our Platform, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe collect and store personal data and certain other sensitive and proprietary information in the operation of our business, including developer, creator, user and employee information, and other confidential data. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or loss of our confidential data, malware, ransomware, viruses, hacking, social engineering, spam, and phishing attacks across our organization, these types of attacks have occurred and may occur on our Platform, our systems, and those of our third-party service providers again in the future. Because of the popularity of our Platform, we believe that we are an attractive target for these sorts of attacks and have seen the frequency of these types of attacks increase over time.\nThe techniques used by malicious actors to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage our systems or networks, or to utilize our systems maliciously, are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized in the industry until launched against a target. Despite the measures we have taken, we at times have not been able to anticipate these techniques, detect, or react in a timely manner, or implement preventive measures, which has resulted in and could continue to result in, delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other security-related incidents. In addition, the use of open source software in our Platform has exposed us to security vulnerabilities in the past and will likely continue to expose us to security vulnerabilities in the future. For example, in December 2021, a vulnerability in popular logging software, Log4j, was publicly announced, and while we have taken steps to patch these and similar vulnerabilities in our systems, we cannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been patched in every system upon which we are dependent or that additional critical vulnerabilities of open source software which we rely upon will not be discovered. Our use of AI in our products and business practices may increase or create additional cybersecurity and privacy risks, including risks of security breaches and incidents.\nOur Platform and services operate in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products, services, and components. Our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’ cybersecurity is limited, and in any event, attackers may be able to circumvent our third-party service providers’ cybersecurity measures. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain of our third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our Platform and service. Security vulnerabilities, errors, or other bugs in these third-party products, services, or components, and security exploits targeting them or even simply the allegation of a vulnerability or security exploit targeting one of these third-party products, services, or components, has at times and could continue to cause us to face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react, remediate, or otherwise address any security vulnerability, breach, or other incident in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures.\nIf any unauthorized access to our network, systems or data, including our sensitive and proprietary information, personal data from our users, developers, or creators, or other data, or any other loss or unavailability of, or unauthorized use, modification, disclosure, or other processing of personal data or any other security breach or incident, occurs or is believed to have occurred, whether as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error or malfeasance, defects, social engineering techniques, ransomware attacks, or otherwise, our reputation, brand and competitive position could be damaged, our and our users’, developers’ and creators’ data and intellectual property could potentially be lost or compromised, and we could be required to spend capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches or incidents and remediate our systems. In the past, we have experienced social engineering and phishing attacks, and if similar attacks occur and are successful, this could have a negative impact on our business or result in unfavorable publicity. Additionally, we contract with certain third parties to store and process certain data for us, including our distribution channels, and these third parties face similar risks of actual and potential security breaches and incidents, which could present similar risks to our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents, including those to secure our product development, test, evaluation, and deployment activities, and we expect our costs will increase as we make improvements to our systems and processes to prevent future breaches and incidents. The economic costs to us to reduce cyber or other security problems, such as spammers, errors, bugs, flaws, “cheating” programs, defects or corrupted data, could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure. Even the perception of these issues may cause developers, creators, and users to use our Platform less or stop using it altogether, and the costs could divert our attention and resources, any of which could result in claims, demands, and legal liability to us, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, and otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. There could also be regulatory fines or other remedies imposed in connection with certain data breaches that take place around the world. Further, certain laws and regulations relating to privacy, biometrics, cybersecurity, and data protection, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), allow for a private right of action, which may lead to consumer litigation for certain data breaches that relate to specified categories of personal information. From time to time, we do identify product vulnerabilities, including through our bug bounty program. Although we have policies and procedures in place designed to promptly characterize the potential impact of such vulnerabilities and develop appropriate patching or upgrade recommendations and also maintain policies and procedures related to vulnerability scanning and management of our internal corporate systems and networks, such policies and procedures may not be followed or detect every issue, and from time to time, we have, and may in the future again, need to proactively disable access to our Platform in order to provide necessary patching or upgrades.\nAlthough we maintain cyber and privacy insurance, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, such coverage may not extend to all types of incidents relating to privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity, and it may be insufficient to cover all costs and expenses associated with such incidents. Further, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nThe expansion of our Platform outside the United States exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe operate our Platform throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 79% of our DAUs and 37% of our revenue was derived from outside the U.S. and Canada region. We intend to continue to expand internationally, and this expansion is a critical element of our future business strategy. However, as we continue to expand internationally, including into developing countries where consumer discretionary spending is relatively weak, while our DAUs increase, the growth rate of our bookings could decelerate due to weaker spending by users from those regions, and our ABPDAU has been and may continue to be negatively impacted. While we have a number of developers, creators, and users outside of the U.S., we have limited offices located outside of the U.S. and Canada, and there is no guarantee that our international expansion efforts will be successful. The risks and challenges associated with expanding our international presence and operations include:\n•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection, and longer collection periods;\n•higher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs;\n•double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the U.S. or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;\n•compliance with multiple, ambiguous, or evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to employment, tax, content regulation, online safety, privacy, data protection, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, data transfer, storage and security, content monitoring, preclusion, and removal, online entertainment offerings, advertising and consumer protection in general, and industry-specific laws and regulations, particularly as these rules apply to interactions with users under the age of 18; \n•uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the U.S.’ and other governments’ trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events, including, without limitation, the evolving relations between the U.S. and China, evolving relations with Russia due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the conflict in the Middle East stemming from Hamas’ attack against Israel; \n•expenses related to monitoring and complying with differing labor and employment regulations, especially in jurisdictions where labor and employment laws may be more favorable to employees than in the U.S.;\n•increased exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business;\n•challenges inherent to efficiently recruiting and retaining qualified employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture and employee programs across all of our offices;\n•management communication and integration problems resulting from language or cultural differences and geographic dispersion;\n•the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n•the uncertainty of our exposure to third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and the availability of statutory safe harbors in some countries;\n•foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the U.S.;\n•risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, and greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and tax laws, trade laws, and export and other trade restrictions;\n•risks relating to the implementation of exchange controls, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”), and other similar trade protection regulations and measures;\n•exposure to regional or global public health issues, and to travel restrictions and other measures undertaken by governments in response to such issues;\n•general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets, including political and economic instability in some countries and regions;\n•localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses and the ability to monitor our Platform in new and evolving markets and in different languages to confirm that we maintain standards, including trust and safety standards, consistent with our brand and reputation;\n•regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;\n•changes in the perception of our Platform by governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; and\n•natural disasters, acts of war, and terrorism, and resulting changes to laws and regulations, including changes oriented to protecting local businesses.\nThese and other factors could harm our ability to generate revenue and bookings outside of the U.S. and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to expand our business and attract users in international markets and doing so will require considerable management attention and resources. International expansion is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. We may not be able to offer our Platform in certain countries, and expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face. For example, in August 2024 we learned that our Platform was blocked in the Republic of Türkiye and we are working with the local authorities with the goal of resolving it.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow our user base, compete effectively with other platforms, and further monetize our Platform, our business will suffer.\nWe have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable our developers and creators to design and build compelling content and deliver it to our users on our Platform. Existing and prospective developers may not be successful in creating content that leads to and maintains user engagement (including maintaining the quality of experiences); they may fail to expand the types of experiences that they can build for users; or our competitors may entice our developers, users and potential users away from, or to spend less time with, our Platform, each of which could adversely affect users’ interest in our Platform and lead to a loss of revenue opportunities and harm our results of operations. The multitude of other entertainment options, online gaming, and other interactive experiences is high, making it difficult to retain users who are dissatisfied with our Platform and seek other entertainment options.\nAdditionally, we may not succeed in further monetizing our Platform and user base. As a result, our user growth, user engagement, financial performance and ability to grow revenue could be significantly harmed if we fail to increase or maintain DAUs; our user growth outpaces our ability to monetize our users, including if our user growth occurs in markets that are not profitable; we fail to provide the tools and education to our developers and creators to enable them to monetize their experiences and developers do not create engaging or new experiences for users; we fail to increase the overall number of developers and creators on our Platform; we fail to establish a successful advertising model; we fail to increase or maintain the amount of time spent on our Platform, the number of experiences, or variety of genres of experiences, that our users engage with, or the usage of our technology for our developers; we fail to increase the features of our Platform, allowing it to more broadly serve the entertainment, education, communication and business markets; we fail to increase penetration and engagement across all demographics, including our goal of reaching ten percent of the global gaming software market, or measures intended to make our Platform more attractive to older-age verified users create the perception that our Platform is not safe for young users; or the experiences on our Platform do not maintain or gain popularity.\nContinuing to manage our growth effectively may require expanding our internal IT systems, technological operations infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and operating and administrative systems and controls. In addition, we have expended in the past and may in the future expend significant resources to launch new features and changes on our Platform that we are unable to monetize, which may significantly harm our business. Any future growth would add more complexity to our organization and require effective coordination across our organization, and an inability to do so would adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nOnly a small portion of our users regularly purchase Robux compared to all users who use our Platform in any period. Our ability to continue to attract and retain paying users will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our paying users with a quality experience and features. If our users do not perceive our offerings, or the offerings of our developers and creators, to be of value, or if we introduce new or adjust existing features or pricing in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain payers or be able to convince users to become paying users of such additional service offerings, and we may not be able to increase the amount of revenue from our user base. If users fail to purchase Robux at rates similar to or greater than they have historically and if we fail to attract new paying users, or if our paying users fail to continue interacting with the Platform and purchasing Robux as they increase in age, our revenue will suffer. Users may reduce their spend on our Platform for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to reduce household expenses, competitive services that provide a better value or experience or as a result of changes in pricing. If our efforts to attract and retain paying users are not successful, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to develop virtual platform-wide events or live experiences on our Platform, our business could suffer.\nWe have undergone efforts to develop the live and limited time events and experiences available on our Platform, such as virtual platform-wide events, concerts, classrooms, and other meeting types, and to offer commercial partners with branding opportunities in conjunction with key events, such as a product launch. There is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful or that users will engage with these experiences. New features or enhancements and changes to the existing features of our Platform, such as virtual reality applications, could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including failure to predict market demand accurately in terms of functionality and to supply features that meet this demand in a timely fashion; defects, errors, or failures; negative publicity about performance, safety, privacy, or effectiveness; delays in releasing new features or enhancements on our Platform; and introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by competitors. The failure to obtain market acceptance for these live experiences would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and brand.\nIntroduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe market for an immersive platform for connection and communication is a new and evolving market characterized by rapid, complex, and disruptive changes in technology and user, developer, and creator demands that could make it difficult for us to effectively compete. The expectations and needs of our users, developers, and creators are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently, enhance and integrate our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate technological developments. If we are unable to react quickly to new technology trends—for example the continued growth of generative AI solutions which affects the ways developers create experiences or may affect the way users consume virtual goods—it may harm our business and results of operation. The expertise in AI, as well as other emerging technologies, can be difficult and costly to obtain given the increasing focus on AI development and competition for talent. Further, social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. AI presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. Failure to address AI ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in our use of AI.\nWe have incorporated, and are continuing to develop and deploy, AI in our products and the operations of our business. Our use of generative AI in aspects of our Platform may present risks and challenges that could increase as AI solutions become more prevalent. The Roblox Cloud may be more relied upon in the future to facilitate increasingly complex decision-making as it integrates hardware and accelerated machine learning AI, including generative AI, for a broad range of compute tasks, including enhanced non-player characters, improved personalization, synthetic content generation, and enhanced automation of the player experience. However, AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. It is possible that at some point the Roblox Cloud may make decisions unpredictably or autonomously, which can raise new or exacerbate existing ethical, technological, legal, and other challenges, and may negatively affect the performance of the Roblox Platform and the user, developer, and creator experience. While we have and will continue to implement safeguards, these deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nThere are also many new and evolving laws and regulations focused on the use of AI. For example, on May 21, 2024, the Council of the European Union approved the latest draft of the Artificial Intelligence Act (“AI Act”) which was published in the Official Journal of the EU on July 12, 2024. The AI Act proposes a framework of prohibitions as well as disclosure, transparency and other regulatory obligations based on various levels of risk for businesses introducing AI systems in the EU. Once the AI Act becomes effective, certain provisions could require us to alter or restrict our use of AI both in features or products available to our users and in our systems that interact with our users, depending on respective levels of risk-categorization, types of systems, and manner of use, under the AI Act. The AI Act also may require us to comply with monitoring and reporting requirements. As a result, we may need to devote substantial time and resources to evaluate our obligations under the AI Act and to develop and execute a plan designed to promote compliance. Noncompliance with the AI Act could result in fines of up to €35 million or 7% of annual global turnover for the previous year, whichever is higher. There have been numerous other laws and bills proposed at the U.S. federal and state level, as well as internationally, aimed at regulating the deployment or provision of AI systems and services. This includes the Colorado AI Act, which was passed and will become effective February 1, 2026, and, similar to the AI Act, provides for a regulatory risk-based framework.\nOur user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may significantly harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.\nWe regularly review metrics, including our DAUs, hours engaged, unique payers, user demographics, and ABPDAU to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and operate and have not been validated by an independent third party. Our metrics are based on estimates and may also differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or underlying assumptions. If our metrics, which are based on estimates, are inaccurate, then investors will have less confidence in our company and our prospects, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline, and our reputation and brand could be harmed.\nThese metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates and underlying assumptions for the applicable period of measurement, but there are inherent challenges in measuring how our Platform is used. As a result, the metrics may misstate the number of DAUs, monthly unique payers, average monthly repurchase rate, hours engaged, ABPDAU, and average bookings per monthly unique payer. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our metrics, which are based on estimates, and such metrics may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology or underlying assumptions. We regularly review our processes and assumptions for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in our use of updated metrics in a current period and corresponding adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics to reflect any change in methodology of a metric in a current period may be impacted by data limitations, limitations in functionality of and user behaviors on different platforms, or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments over current and historic periods.\nAdditionally, there are users who have multiple accounts, fake user accounts, or fraudulent accounts created by bots to inflate user activity for a particular user, developer or creator on our Platform. These actions may be to make the developer’s or creator’s experience or other content appear more popular than it really is or they may be to enable users to level up or otherwise progress in an experience more rapidly. Detecting and taking action with respect to such issues requires considerable judgment and is technically challenging. We strive to detect and minimize fraud, the use of bots, and unauthorized use of our Platform, and while these practices are prohibited in our terms of service and we implement measures to detect and suppress that behavior, when we are unsuccessful, our operating results may be negatively affected. \nIn addition, some of our demographic data may also be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, because users self-report their dates of birth, our age demographic data may differ from our users’ actual ages. If our users provide us with incorrect or incomplete information regarding their age or other attributes, then our estimates may prove inaccurate.\nErrors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could also result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. For instance, if a significant understatement or overstatement of active users or hours engaged were to occur, we may expend resources to implement unnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract a sufficient number of users to satisfy our growth strategies. If our investors or developers do not perceive our user, geographic, or other demographic metrics to be accurate representations of our user base, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user, geographic, or other demographic metrics, our reputation may be seriously harmed. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies and Platform evolve, including through the application of new data sets, the introduction of new metrics or technologies, or as our Platform changes with new features and enhancements. Such changes could lead to investor confusion or the perception that our estimates, methodologies and underlying assumptions are unreliable, which could also cause our developers, creators, and brand and other partners to be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our Platform, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on suppliers for data center capacity and certain components of the equipment we use to operate our Platform and any disruption in the availability of data center capacity or components could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our Platform or replace defective equipment.\nWe rely on suppliers for data center capacity and several components of the equipment we use to operate our Platform. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to risks, including reduced control over costs and constraints based on the current availability, terms, and pricing of these components and data center capacity. While the network equipment and servers we purchase generally are commodity equipment and we believe an alternative supply source for network equipment and servers on substantially similar terms could be identified quickly, our business could be adversely affected until those efforts are completed. In addition, the technology equipment industry has experienced component shortages and delivery delays, and we have and may in the future experience shortages or delays, including as a result of increased demand in the industry, such as due to rapid growth in AI demand, natural disasters, export and import control restrictions, or our suppliers lacking sufficient rights to supply the components in all jurisdictions in which we have data centers and edge data centers that support our Platform. For example, supply chain constraints for servers and other networking equipment required for our operations has resulted and could in the future result in disruptions and delays for these components and the delivery and installation of such components at our data centers and edge data centers. If our supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, there can be no assurance that additional supplies or components can serve as adequate replacements for the existing components or that supplies will be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Any disruption or delay in the supply of hardware components or data center availability may delay the opening of new data centers, edge data centers, co-location facilities or the creation of fully redundant operations, limit capacity expansion, or replacement of defective or obsolete equipment at existing data centers and edge data centers or cause other constraints on our operations that could damage our ability to serve our developers, creators, and users.\nSome developers, creators, and users on our Platform may make unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal use of Robux and other digital goods or experiences on our Platform, including through unauthorized third-party websites or “cheating” programs.\nRobux and digital goods on our Platform have no monetary value outside of our Platform, but users have made and may in the future make unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal sales and/or purchases of Robux, other digital goods and Roblox accounts on or off of our Platform, including through unauthorized third-party websites in exchange for fiat currency or to facilitate online wagers. For example, some users have made fraudulent use of credit cards owned by others to purchase Robux and offer the purchased Robux for sale at a discount on third-party websites. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total chargebacks to us from all fraud was approximately 3.41% of bookings.\nWhile we regularly monitor and screen usage of our Platform with the aim of identifying and preventing these activities, and regularly monitor third-party websites for fraudulent Robux or digital goods offers as well as regularly send cease-and-desist letters to operators of these third-party websites, we are unable to control or stop all unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal transactions in Robux or other digital goods that occurs on or off of our Platform. Although we are not responsible for such unauthorized, fraudulent, and/or illegal activities conducted by these third parties, our user experience may be adversely affected, and users and/or developers may choose to leave our Platform if these activities are pervasive. These activities have and may in the future result in negative publicity, disputes, and legal claims, and measures we take in response may be expensive, time consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nIn addition, unauthorized, fraudulent, and/or illegal purchases and/or sales of Robux, Roblox accounts, or other digital goods on or off of our Platform, including through third-party websites, bots, fake accounts, or “cheating” or malicious programs that enable users to exploit vulnerabilities in the experiences on our Platform or our partners’ websites and platforms, and could reduce our revenue and bookings by, among other things, decreasing revenue from authorized and legitimate transactions, increasing chargebacks from unauthorized credit card transactions, or causing us to lose revenue and bookings from dissatisfied users who stop engaging with the experiences on our Platform. Additionally, such prohibited activity could increase costs that we incur to develop technological measures to curtail unauthorized transactions and other malicious programs, or could reduce other operating metrics.\nUnder our community rules for our Platform, which developers, creators, and users are obligated to comply with, we reserve the right to temporarily or permanently ban individuals for breaching our Terms of Use or Community Standards, including by engaging in any illegal activity on the Platform. We have banned individuals as a result of unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal use of our Platform, Robux or other digital goods on our Platform. We have also employed technological measures to help detect unauthorized Robux transactions and continue to develop additional methods and processes through which we can identify unauthorized transactions and block such transactions. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to prevent or minimize these unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal transactions will be successful.\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments in privacy, data protection, user safety, cybersecurity, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations of individuals we have determined to have attempted to access and, in some cases, have accessed, user data without authorization. Our internal teams also continually monitor and address any unauthorized attempts to access data stored on servers that we own or control or data available to our third-party customer service providers. As a result of these efforts, we have discovered and disclosed, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and disclose, additional incidents of misuse of or unauthorized access of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We have taken steps to protect the data that we have access to, but despite these efforts, our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could be insufficient or breached as a result of third-party action, malfeasance, employee errors, service provider errors, technological limitations, defects or vulnerabilities in our Platform or otherwise. Additionally, many of our employees and third-party service providers with access to user data currently are and may in the future be working remotely, which may increase our employees’ or our third-party service providers’ risk of security breaches or incidents. Moreover, the risk of state-supported and geopolitical-related cyber-attacks may increase with geopolitical events. We have sometimes failed to discover and in the future may not discover all such incidents or activity or be able to respond to or otherwise address them, promptly, in sufficient respects or at all. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, involve the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, theft of in-game currency or virtual items in valid user accounts, and activities that threaten people’s safety on- or offline. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments, whether actual or perceived, may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments have and may continue to subject us to future litigation and regulatory inquiries, investigations, and proceedings, including from data protection authorities in countries where we offer services and/or have users, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nWe focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.\nA significant part of our business strategy and culture is to focus on long-term growth and developer, creator, and user experience over short-term financial results. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our developer, creator, and user community, as developers, creators, and users increase the amount and types of experiences and virtual items they make available on our Platform and the content they consume, as we continue to seek ways to increase payments to our developers and as we develop and further enhance our Platform, expand our technical infrastructure and data centers, and hire additional employees to support our expanding operations. As a result, in the near- and medium-term, we may continue to operate at a loss, or our near- and medium-term profitability may be lower than it would be if our strategy were to maximize near- and medium-term profitability. We expect to continue making significant expenditures to grow our Platform and develop new features, integrations, capabilities, and enhancements to our Platform for the benefit of our developers, creators, and users. We will also be required to invest in our internal IT systems, technological operations infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and operating, compliance and administrative systems and controls. Such expenditures may not result in improved business results or profitability over the long-term. If we are ultimately unable to achieve or improve profitability at the level or during the time frame anticipated by securities or industry analysts, investors and our stockholders, the trading price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, improve our Platform and operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel, and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve offering security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. General market conditions including trading volatility affecting technology companies may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. Also, to the extent outstanding additional shares subject to options and warrants to purchase our capital stock are authorized and exercised, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending on the size of the issuance or exercise. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nThe popularity of our Lua scripting language is a key driver of content creation and engagement with our Platform, and if other programming languages or platforms become more popular with our developers, it may affect engagement with and content creation for our Platform.\nRoblox experiences are programmed using our Lua scripting language on the Roblox Platform. In order to enhance the attractiveness of our Platform to potential developers, we have made our Lua scripting language available without charge. Lua scripting language permits developers on the Roblox Platform to develop customized add-on features for their own or others’ use, and we have provided education to our developers on how to write add-on programs using Lua scripting language. As part of this strategy, we have encouraged the development of an active community of Lua programmers similar to those which have emerged for other software platforms. The widespread use and popularity of our Lua scripting language is critical to creating engaging content on and demand for our Platform. If developers do not find our Lua scripting language or our Platform simple and attractive for developing content or determine that our Lua scripting language or other features of our Platform are undesirable or inferior to other scripting languages or platforms, or Lua scripting language becomes unavailable for use by the developers for any reason, they may shift their resources to developing content on other platforms, and our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on Amazon Web Services for a portion of our cloud infrastructure in certain areas, and as a result any disruption of AWS would negatively affect our operations and significantly harm our business.\nWe rely on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) as a third-party provider for a portion of our backend services, including for some of our high-speed databases, scalable object storage, and message queuing services, as well as virtual cloud infrastructure. For location-based support areas, we outsource certain aspects of the infrastructure relating to our cloud-native Platform. As a result, our operations depend, in part, on AWS’ ability to protect their services against damage or interruption from natural or manmade disasters. Our developers, creators, and users need to be able to access our Platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize multiple AWS availability zones to support our cloud infrastructure, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by natural or manmade disasters and other similar events beyond our control, could adversely affect our cloud-native Platform. Any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS could impair our ability to deliver our Platform reliably to our developers, creators, and users.\nAdditionally, if AWS were to experience a hacking attack or other security incident, it could result in unauthorized access to, damage to, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of, disclosure of, modification of, destruction of, or loss of our data or our developers’, creators’, and users’ data or disrupt our ability to provide our Platform or service. A prolonged AWS service disruption affecting our cloud-native Platform for any of the foregoing reasons would adversely impact our ability to serve our users, developers, and creators and could damage our reputation with current and potential users, developers, and creators, expose us to liability, result in substantial costs for remediation, cause us to lose users, developers, and creators, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative hosting cloud infrastructure services or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage or interfere with the AWS services we use.\nWe have entered into an enterprise agreement with AWS and a supplemental private pricing addendum that will remain in effect until June 2026. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of AWS services or features that we utilize, we could experience interruptions in access to our Platform as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging for or creating new facilities or re-architecting our Platform for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe must continue to attract and retain users, developers, and creators, and highly qualified personnel in very competitive markets to continue to execute on our business strategy and growth plans, and the loss of key personnel or failure to attract and retain users, developers, and creators could significantly harm our business.\nWe compete for users, developers, and creators. We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention and their hours engaged with other global technology leaders such as Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent, global entertainment companies such as Comcast, Disney, ViacomCBS, and Warner Bros Discovery, global gaming companies such as Activision Blizzard (now owned by Microsoft), Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Epic Games, Krafton, NetEase, and Valve, online content platforms including Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, as well as social platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, Pinterest, X, Reddit, Discord and Snap.\nWe also rely on developers and creators to create the content that leads to and maintains user engagement (including maintaining the quality of experiences). We compete to attract and retain developers and engineering talent with gaming and metaverse platforms such as Epic Games, Unity, Meta Platforms, and Valve Corporation, which also give developers the ability to create or distribute interactive content. We do not have any agreements with our developers that require them to continue to use our Platform for any time period. Some of our developers have developed attractive businesses in developing content, including games, on our Platform. While we have millions of developers and creators on our Platform, 50% of in-experience hours engaged in experiences were spent in the top 50 experiences in the month ending December 31, 2024. In the future, if we are unable to continue to provide value to these developers and they have alternative methods to publish and commercialize their offerings, they may not continue to provide content to our Platform. Should we fail to provide compelling advantages to continued use of our ecosystem to developers, they may elect to develop content on competing interactive entertainment platforms. Should we fail to control botting and other forms of automated play on our Platform, developers, creators and users may find our Platform less attractive and may elect to engage on competing interactive entertainment platforms. If a significant number of our developers no longer provide content, we fail to increase the number of developers using our Platform, or developers and creators whose experiences account for a substantial portion of our Hours Engaged choose to leave our Platform, we may experience an overall reduction in the quantity and quality of our experiences, which could adversely affect users’ interest in our Platform and lead to a loss of revenue opportunities and harm our results of operations. \nWe expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages, such as larger sales and marketing budgets and resources; broader and more established relationships with users, developers, and creators; greater resources to make acquisitions and enter into strategic partnerships; lower labor and research and development costs; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.\nAdditionally, we depend on the continued services and performance of our Founder, President, CEO and Chair of our Board of Directors, David Baszucki, members of our senior management team, and other key personnel. David Baszucki has been responsible for our strategic vision, and should he stop working for us for any reason, it is unlikely that we would be able to immediately find a suitable replacement. We do not maintain key man life insurance for David Baszucki, and do not believe any amount of key man insurance would allow us to recover from the harm to our business if David Baszucki were to leave the Company for any reason. Similarly, members of our senior management team and other key personnel are highly sought after and others may attempt to encourage these individuals to leave the Company. The loss of one or more of the members of the senior management team or other key personnel for any reason, or the inability to attract new or replacement members of our senior management team, other key personnel, or highly qualified employees could disrupt our operations, create uncertainty among investors, adversely impact employee retention and morale, and significantly harm our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We generally collect revenue from our international markets in the local currency. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 79% our DAUs and 37% of our revenue was derived from outside the U.S. and Canada region. While we periodically adjust the price of Robux to account for the relative value of this local currency to the U.S. dollar, these adjustments are not immediate nor do they typically exactly track the underlying currency fluctuations. As a result, rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has harmed and may in the future harm our reported results and cause the revenue derived from our foreign users and overall revenue to decrease. In addition, even if we do adjust the cost of our Robux in foreign markets to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, such fluctuations could change the costs of purchasing Robux to our users outside of the U.S., which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or improve our financial performance.\nWe also incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Additionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, and inflation have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty, and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of our expenses being higher which may not be offset by additional revenue earned in the local currency. This could impact our reported results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options, and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement in the future to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and investments in other companies, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and significantly harm our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions and investments to add or access specialized employees and complementary companies, features, and technologies. Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate larger or more complex companies, features, and technologies is unproven. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions, investments or similar strategic transactions on favorable terms, if at all. The pursuit of potential acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur significant expenses related to identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable targets, whether or not they are consummated. Our previous and future acquisitions and investments may not achieve our goals, and any future acquisitions or investments we complete could be viewed negatively by users, developers, creators, partners, or investors. In addition, if we fail to successfully close transactions or integrate new teams into our corporate culture, or fail to integrate the features and technologies associated with acquisitions or investments, our business could be significantly harmed. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired products, technology, and personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition, including accounting charges which could be recognized as a current period expense. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits of synergies from the target business, may encounter challenges with incorporating the acquired features and technologies into our Platform while maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand, or may fail to identify security vulnerabilities in acquired technology prior to integration with our technology and Platform. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities that we assume as a result of acquiring companies, including claims related to the acquired company, its offerings or technologies or potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired business that were not discovered during diligence. We will pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisitions or investments, any of which could significantly harm our financial results. In addition, it generally takes several months after the closing of an acquisition to finalize the purchase price allocation. Therefore, it is possible that our valuation of an acquisition may change and result in unanticipated write-offs or charges, impairment of our goodwill, or a material change to the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with a particular acquisition, any of which could significantly harm our business. Selling equity to finance any such acquisition would also dilute our stockholders. Incurring debt would increase our fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.\nThe U.S. government recently introduced regulations that require notification of or prohibit certain transactions by U.S. persons with entities in China or with linkages to China (the “Outbound Investment Rules”). The Outbound Investment Rules could apply to certain intracompany activities between Roblox and Roblox China Holding Corp or Luobu, as well as other Roblox investments or activities with entities in China or with linkages to China. The Outbound Investment Rules regulations could also limit the ability of others to transact certain business with the Company if those transactions involve or benefit, directly or indirectly Roblox China Holding Corp, Luobu or other Company operations in China. Where the Outbound Investment Rules apply to a given transaction, it might limit our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.\nOur acquisition and investment strategy may not succeed if we are unable to remain attractive to target companies or expeditiously close transactions. If we develop a reputation for being a difficult acquirer or having an unfavorable work environment, or if target companies view our Class A common stock unfavorably, we may be unable to consummate key acquisition transactions essential to our corporate strategy and our business may be significantly harmed.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, each of which could significantly harm our business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $2,382.3 million, which do not expire, federal net operating loss carryforwards of $10.7 million, which begin to expire in 2037, state net operating loss carryforwards of $1,433.7 million, which begin to expire in 2025, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $64.8 million, which begin to expire in 2025. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to limitations on utilization or benefit due to the ownership change limitations provided by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and other similar provisions. All of the $2,382.3 million of federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely but the deductibility of these losses is generally limited to 80% of current year taxable income. Our net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to limitations under state law. For example, California legislation enacted in June 2024 limits the use of state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and before January 1, 2027. If our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes expire before utilization or are subject to limitations, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors or our publicly announced guidance, and changes in our business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For example, the majority of the virtual items available on our Platform are durable virtual items, which, when acquired, are recognized ratably over the estimated period of time the virtual items are available to the user (estimated to be the average lifetime of a paying user). Every quarter, we complete an assessment of our estimated average lifetime of a paying user, which is used for revenue recognition of durable virtual items and calculated based on historical monthly retention data for each paying user cohort to project future participation on our Platform. We calculate the average historical monthly retention data by determining the weighted average of monthly paying users that have spent time on our Platform. In 2021, our estimated average lifetime of a paying user was 23 months. In the first quarter of 2022, we updated our estimated average lifetime of a paying user from 23 months to 25 months and in the third quarter of 2022 we increased the estimated average lifetime of a paying user from 25 months to 28 months. The estimated average lifetime of a paying user remained at 28 months through the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, the estimated average lifetime of a paying user decreased to 27 months. Based on the carrying amount of deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue as of March 31, 2024, the change resulted in an increase in our fiscal year 2024 revenue and cost of revenue by $98.0 million and $20.4 million, respectively. \nMuch of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of purchases of Robux during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in purchases of Robux in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue and operating results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue and operating results in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant near-term downturns in purchases of Robux for a variety of reasons may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nIn addition to revenue recognition and estimates of the average lifetime of a paying user, our accounting policies that involve judgment include those related to assumptions used for estimating the fair value of common stock to calculate stock-based compensation, capitalization of internal-use software costs, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, certain accrued liabilities, and valuation allowances associated with income taxes. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales, value added, or other similar taxes for the purchase of our virtual currency, for the sale of digital content, or purchase of physical goods, between our developers, creators, and users.\nAlthough we, either directly or through our third-party distribution channels, collect and remit taxes from users in certain countries and regions on the sale of our virtual currency, there are some jurisdictions in which we operate where we do not currently collect taxes from users. The application of tax laws pertaining to the collection of sales, value added, and similar taxes to e-commerce businesses, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. For example, many countries have recently enacted tax laws that require non-resident providers to register for and levy value added taxes on electronically provided services to such country’s residents. This would require us to calculate, collect, and remit value added taxes in some jurisdictions, even if we have no physical presence in such jurisdictions. Further, we may need to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions or our business model to be able to collect and remit sales, value added, or similar taxes under such tax laws in the future.\nFurther, many jurisdictions have also adopted or are considering adopting marketplace facilitator laws that shift the burden of tax collection to online marketplaces. In certain states, we may be characterized as a marketplace facilitator for the sale of digital content or physical goods between our developers, creators, and users, and in such instances, we may need to invest substantial amounts to modify our solutions or business model to be able to meet any reporting and collection obligations with respect to sales, value added, or similar taxes. A successful assertion by a jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, value added, or other taxes for the sale of content or physical goods between our developers, creators, and users, could, among other things, result in substantial tax payments, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage potential users, developers, or creators from subscribing to our Platform, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the benefits expected through our China joint venture.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Songhua River Investment Limited, referred to as Songhua, an affiliate of Tencent Holdings Limited (“Tencent Holdings”), under which we created Roblox China Holding Corp (the “China JV”), of which we own a 51% ownership interest. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Shenzhen, branded as “Luobu,” the China JV is engaged in the development, localization, and licensing to Chinese creators of a Chinese version of Roblox Studio. Luobu also develops and oversees relations with local Chinese developers and helps them build and publish experiences and content for our global Platform. In December 2020, Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Co. Ltd (“Tencent”), received a required publishing license from the Chinese government, which enabled Tencent to publish a localized version of the Roblox Client as a game in China under the name “Luobulesi.” The license could be withdrawn if Tencent fails to comply with applicable existing or future regulations. Such withdrawal could significantly impair or eliminate the ability to publish and operate Luobulesi in China. The Luobulesi app is not currently available to users in China while we and Tencent build the next version of Luobulesi.\nTensions between the U.S. and China have resulted in trade restrictions that could harm our ability to participate in Chinese markets and numerous additional such restrictions have been threatened by both countries. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that could restrict our ability to participate in the China JV. We may find it difficult or impossible to comply with these or other conflicting regulations in the U.S. and China, which could make it difficult or impossible to achieve our business objectives in China or realize a return on our investment in this market.\nRelations may also be compromised if the U.S. pressures the Chinese government regarding its monetary, economic, or social policies. Changes in political conditions in China and changes in the state of China-U.S. relations are difficult to predict and could adversely affect the operations or financial condition of the China JV. In addition, because of our proposed involvement in the Chinese market, any deterioration in political or trade relations might result in our products being perceived as less attractive in the U.S. or elsewhere. In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) added Tencent Holdings to its list of Chinese military companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States under section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (“1260H List”). Beginning in June 2026, this may restrict our ability to resell goods and services of Tencent Holdings to the DOD. The designation may also result in negative publicity for us and the China JV. Further regulatory changes adding Tencent Holdings to additional lists or export and sanctions related restricted or prohibited parties or further controls on entities viewed as connected to the Chinese military could impact our ability to work with Tencent Holdings. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (“CFIUS”) has continued to apply a more stringent review of certain foreign investment in U.S. companies, including investment by Chinese entities, and has made inquiries to us with respect to Tencent Holding’s equity investment in us and involvement in the China JV. We cannot predict what effect any further inquiry by CFIUS into our relationship with Tencent and Tencent Holdings, developments with respect to the 1260H List, or changes in China-U.S. relations overall may have on our ability to effectively support the China JV or on the operations or success of the China JV.\nThe Chinese economic, legal, and political landscape also differs from other countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement and regulation, control of foreign exchange, and uncertainty regarding the practical enforceability of intellectual property rights. The laws, regulations and legal requirements in China are also subject to frequent changes and the exact obligations under and enforcement of laws and regulations are often subject to unpublished internal government interpretations and policies which makes it challenging to ascertain compliance with such laws. We may incur increased operating expenses related to cybersecurity and data protection in China, including with respect to access to Chinese user data and confidential company information as well as any network interconnections and cross border system integrations.\nIn addition to market and regulatory factors, any future success of the China JV will require a collaborative effort with Tencent to build and operate Luobu and Luobulesi as together, they will form the exclusive basis for growing our penetration in the China market. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a termination of certain of the contractual relationships applicable to Luobu, a change of control of us, or the acquisition of 20% of our outstanding securities by certain specified Chinese industry participants, we may be required to purchase Songhua’s interest in the China JV at a fair market value determined at the time of such purchase. Any future requirement to purchase the interest in China JV from Songhua may have a material adverse effect upon our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations both as a result of the purchase of such interests and the fact that we would need to identify and partner with an alternative Chinese partner in order for operations to continue in the China market.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nBecause we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection. The regulatory frameworks for these matters worldwide are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nCertain privacy, biometrics, cybersecurity, and data protection laws and regulations have placed and will continue to place significant privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity obligations on organizations such as ours and may require us to continue to change our policies and procedures. For example, the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes stringent data protection requirements regarding EU personal data, and its provisions include increasing the maximum level of fines that EU regulators may impose for the most serious breaches of noncompliance of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues of the previous year, whichever is greater. Such fines would be in addition to (i) the rights of individuals to sue for damages in respect of any data privacy breach which causes them to suffer harm, (ii) the right of individual member states to impose additional sanctions over and above the administrative fines specified in the GDPR, and (iii) the ability of supervisory authorities to impose orders requiring companies to modify their practices. If we are found not to be compliant with GDPR or similar requirements, including obligations to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) to the U.S., we may be subject to significant fines and the risk of civil litigation.\nThe United Kingdom maintains the Data Protection Act of 2018 and the UK GDPR, which collectively implement and complement the GDPR and provide for penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of annual global revenues of the previous year. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of “adequacy” concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the EEA to the U.K. Such adequacy decision must, however, be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR of 2018 and other United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term, nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nIn addition, various local, national, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our operations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), in the U.S., Article 8 of the GDPR and similar regulations in other jurisdictions. COPPA imposes strict requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age (or 16 years of age under other regulatory regimes). We estimate that approximately 40% of our DAUs were under the age of 13 during the year ended December 31, 2024. COPPA requires companies to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. Both the U.S. federal government and the states can enforce COPPA and violations of COPPA can lead to significant fines. The FTC released final amendments to its COPPA Rule on January 16, 2025, that, among other things, expand the scope of covered information, provide for revised notices, and impose new data retention and information security obligations. Following an executive order that froze all then-pending federal regulations as of January 20, 2025, the amended COPPA Rule is pending further review and may be subject to additional modifications. No assurances can be given that our compliance efforts will be sufficient to avoid allegations of COPPA violations, and any non-compliance or allegations of non-compliance could expose us to significant liability, penalties and loss of revenue, significantly harm our reputation, and could be costly and time consuming to address or defend. To the extent we rely on consent for processing personal data under the GDPR, consent or authorization from the holder of parental responsibility is required in certain cases for the processing of personal data of children under the age of 16, and member states may enact laws that lower that age to 13. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions the law may allow minors to disaffirm their contracts, including our Terms of Use. If minors on our Platform are able to avoid enforcement of our Terms of Use under applicable law, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe continue to monitor updated guidance from the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner Office (“ICO”) on the Age Appropriate Design Code (“AADC”), which focuses on online safety and protection of children’s privacy online. The AADC became enforceable on September 2, 2021. Noncompliance with the AADC may result in publicized investigations, substantial fines, audits or other proceedings by the ICO, and other regulators in the EEA or Switzerland, as noncompliance with the AADC may indicate noncompliance with applicable data protection law. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under the GDPR and laws and regulations of applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.\nOther jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, many of which share similarities with the GDPR. For example, Law no. 13.709/2018 of Brazil, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD, entered into effect on September 18, 2020, authorizing a private right of action for violations. Penalties may include fines of up to 2% of the organization’s revenue in Brazil in the previous year or 50M reais (approximately $9.5 million U.S. dollars). The LGPD applies to businesses (both inside and outside Brazil) that process the personal data of users who are located in Brazil. The LGPD provides users with the similar rights as the GDPR regarding their data. A Brazilian Data Protection Authority, Brazilian National Data Protection Authority (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados) has been established to provide rules and guidance on how to interpret and implement the LGPD’s requirements, including regarding notice of processing, data transfer requirements, and other compliance obligations, such as security measures, recordkeeping, training, and governance. Additionally, the Personal Information Protection Law, (“PIPL”) of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), was adopted on August 20, 2021, and went into effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL shares similarities with the GDPR, including extraterritorial application, data minimization, data localization, and purpose limitation requirements, and obligations to provide certain notices and rights to citizens of the PRC. The PIPL allows for fines of up to 50 million renminbi or 5% of a covered company’s revenue in the prior year. Our approach with respect to regimes such as the LGPD, PIPL, and other foreign legislation may be subject to further evaluation and change, our compliance measures may not be fully adequate and may require modification, we may expend significant time and cost in developing and maintaining a privacy governance program, data transfer or localization mechanisms, or other processes or measures to comply with such regimes, and any implementing regulations or guidance under these regimes, and we may potentially face claims, litigation, investigations, or other proceedings or liability regarding such regimes and may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under such regimes and any measures we take to comply with them.\nIn addition, the CCPA, which established a new privacy framework for covered businesses in California, such as ours, went into effect in January 2020, requiring us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the likelihood and cost of data breach litigation. The CCPA was significantly modified and supplemented by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which was approved in November 2020. The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023 and, among other things, gives California residents the ability to limit the use of their sensitive information, provides for penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establishes a new agency to implement and enforce the law. Further, the CCPA has prompted similar legislative developments in other states in the U.S., including laws enacted in Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, Oregon, Delaware, Texas, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Minnesota. These developments create the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. Other states, including California, Utah and Arkansas, have passed legislation imposing substantial new obligations upon companies that offer online services, products, or features “likely to be accessed” by children 17 years of age or under, or certain types of social media and digital services, respectively. The California legislation includes certain requirements and principles from the AADC including, among other things, data protection impact assessments and the implementation of privacy by design. The laws in Utah, Florida, and Arkansas impose restrictions and obligations in connection with users who are, or are deemed to be, under 18, including access restrictions and restrictions on abilities for minors to create accounts. Many states have also passed their own laws that require verifiable parental consent before allowing children to create an account or that otherwise impact companies that process children’s personal data. In June 2024, the New York governor signed a bill into law that prohibits covered social media companies from providing individuals under 18 with “addictive feeds,” as a significant part of their services and imposes obligations on such companies that prohibits the collection, use, sharing, and sale personal data of individuals under 18 unless it is strictly necessary, or where informed consent is obtained. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of operating our products and services and other aspects of our business. The impact of these recent regulations and potential future regulations related to privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and related matters, such as age verification, are far-reaching, create a patchwork of overlapping but different laws, and have required and may continue to require us to, modify practices, policies, features and Platform defaults, incur substantial costs and expenses, and at times restrict our operations. Additionally, requirements for verified parental consent before allowing children to create an account may limit the use of our Platform or reduce our overall demand for our Platform, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and other legal obligations and certain industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection. However, it is possible that the obligations imposed on us by applicable laws and regulations, industry codes of conduct or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or related matters may be interpreted and applied in inconsistent manners and may conflict with other rules or our practices in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, due to the nature of our service, we are unable to maintain complete control over cybersecurity or the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of a security breach or incident. For example, our customers may accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is “SIM swapped,” lost, or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our obligations to users or other third parties relating to privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or related matters, or our other policies or actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or related matters, or any actual or perceived compromise of security, including any such compromise that results in the unauthorized loss, unavailability, modification, release, transfer, or other processing of personal information or other user, developer or creator data, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, claims or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our developers, creators, and users to lose trust in us, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory restrictions on virtual currencies like Robux, prepaid gift cards and payment-related activities may adversely affect our Platform, experiences, and virtual items on our Platform, which may negatively impact our revenue, bookings, business, and reputation.\nThe regulations that apply to virtual currencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change. It is possible that regulators in the U.S. or elsewhere may take regulatory actions in the future that restrict our ability to license Robux, allow users to acquire or use other digital goods available on our Platform, or that prohibit developers or creators on our Platform from earning Robux. In addition, we make prepaid gift cards available for sale internationally that may be used to redeem Robux and our Developer Exchange Program allows developers to exchange their accumulated earned Robux for fiat currency under certain conditions. We are or may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those governing anti-money laundering and prepaid cards. Regulators may impose restrictions or bans on our ability to operate our Developer Exchange Program or on the sale of prepaid gift cards. Any such restrictions or prohibitions may adversely affect our Platform, business, revenue, bookings and our developers. In the United States, the SEC, its staff, and similar state regulators have deemed certain virtual currencies to be securities subject to regulation under the federal and state securities laws. While we do not consider Robux to be a security, if Robux were subject to the federal or state securities laws of the U.S., we may be required to redesign our Platform considerably, in a manner that would be disruptive to operations and costly to implement, which may threaten the viability of the Platform. We may also be subject to enforcement or other regulatory actions by federal or state regulators, as well as private litigation, which could be costly to resolve. For example, some existing laws regarding the regulation of currency, money transmitters and other financial institutions, and unclaimed property have been interpreted to cover virtual currencies, like Robux.\nThe increased use of interactive entertainment offerings like ours by consumers, including younger consumers, have prompted and may continue to prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and regulations throughout the world that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours making virtual currencies like Robux available for sale. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has announced that it is monitoring business practices in video gaming marketplaces and gaming currencies for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws, and has proposed new interpretations of existing law that would regulate both under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Increased regulatory scrutiny may increase compliance obligations and require us to devote legal and other resources and make changes to our Platform to address such regulation, which may negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Any inability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations issued by the CFPB or any other regulatory authority could lead to regulatory investigations, or result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings and adversely affect us and our results of operations.\nAlthough we have structured our virtual currency, prepaid gift cards and the Developer Exchange Program with applicable laws and regulations in mind, in some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of applicable laws and regulations is not clear and a regulator could subject us to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. If a relevant regulator disagreed with our analysis of and compliance with applicable laws, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from those regulators, which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and may subject us to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nRegulatory scrutiny, changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere that prohibit us from making Robux available on our Platform would require us to make significant changes to our Platform or require us to take on more onerous compliance obligations, which would materially impair our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to various governmental export control, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations that require our compliance and may subject us to liability if we violate these controls.\nIn some cases, our software and experiences are subject to export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and trade and economic sanctions, including those administered by OFAC, which we collectively refer to as Trade Control Laws and Regulations. Thus, we are subject to laws and regulations that could limit our ability to offer access or full access to our Platform and experiences to certain persons and in certain countries or territories. For example, certain U.S. laws and regulations administered and enforced by OFAC, may limit our ability to give certain users, developers, and creators access to aspects of our Platform and experiences. Trade Control Laws and Regulations are complex and dynamic, and monitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging. In addition, we rely on our payment processors for compliance with certain of these Trade Control Laws and Regulations, including preventing paid activity by users, developers, and creators that attempt to access our Platform from various jurisdictions comprehensively sanctioned by OFAC, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and sanctioned regions of Ukraine. Users, developers, and creators from certain of these countries and territories have access to our Platform and experiences and there can be no guarantee we will be found to have been in full compliance with Trade Control Laws and Regulations during all relevant periods. Any failure by us or our payment processors to comply with the Trade Control Laws and Regulations may lead to violations of the Trade Control Laws and Regulations that could expose us to liability. Additionally, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and other countries imposed certain economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus and have continued to strengthen these controls. These countries could impose even broader sanctions and additional export restrictions or take other actions that could impact our business. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and monetary penalties.\nIn addition, various foreign governments may also impose controls, export license requirements, and/or restrictions applicable to our Platform and experiences. Compliance with such applicable regulatory requirements may create delays in the introduction of our Platform in some international markets or prevent certain international users from accessing our Platform.\nChanges in tax laws and unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of several taxing jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax liability and reporting obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions, cost of compliance, and/or our tax liabilities. Certain jurisdictions, such as Canada, the United Kingdom and France, have enacted a digital services tax on certain digital revenue streams. Other jurisdictions, such as Brazil, have proposed indirect tax reform which may impose value added tax on the sales of electronically supplied services. Such laws and other attempts to impose taxes on e-commerce activities would likely increase the cost to us of operating our business, discourage potential customers from subscribing to our Platform, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial conditions. In addition, a number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or recording-keeping obligations for digital platforms. These new requirements may require us to modify our data processing and reporting practices and policies, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has proposed the Pillar One framework as part of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, which would revise existing profit allocation and nexus rules to require profit allocation based on location of sales versus physical presence for certain large multinational businesses, but if implemented, could result in the removal of unilateral digital services tax initiatives described above.\nAny developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our compliance costs, effective tax rate, and our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to unclaimed property escheat laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time. We are subject to state audits with regard to our escheatment practices. The legislation and regulations related to unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by government authorities. Although we believe that the positions we have taken are reasonable, authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for unclaimed property, interest and penalties in excess of accrued liabilities. An unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector in order to influence official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. \nWith regard to our international business, we have engaged with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our solutions and obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We or our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries have had direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries, even if we do not authorize such activities and notwithstanding having policies, training, and procedures designed to address compliance with these laws, we cannot assure you that no violations of our policies or these laws will occur.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management, as well as significant defense costs and other professional fees. In addition, noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions against us, our officers, or our employees, disgorgement of profits, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government or other persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our reputation, business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and the price of our Class A common stock could be harmed. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nWe may incur liability as a result of content published using our Platform or as a result of claims related to content generated by our developers, creators, and users, including copyright infringement, and legislation regulating content on our Platform may require us to change our Platform or business practices.\nOur success relies in part on the ability of developers and creators to drive engagement with content that is challenging, engaging, fun, interesting, and novel. Developers and creators are responsible for clearing the rights to all of the content they upload to our service or physical goods that they make available for sale, but some developers or creators may upload content or link goods that infringes the rights or violates the terms of use of third parties in violation of our Terms of Use. We rely upon legal protections in various jurisdictions to protect us from claims of monetary damages for content that is uploaded to and stored on our system at the direction of our users, or counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material made available for sale, but those protections may change or disappear over time, increasing our exposure for claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement. If we should lose or fail to qualify for statutory or other legal protections that immunize us from monetary damages for intellectual property infringement, the damages could be significant and have a material impact on our business. While we have implemented measures designed to limit our exposure to claims of intellectual property infringement, intellectual property owners may allege that we failed to take appropriate measures to prevent infringing activities on our systems, that we turned a blind eye to infringement, or that we facilitated, induced or contributed to infringement.\nEven though we are not required to monitor uploaded content for copyright infringement in the U.S., we have chosen to do so through the services of a third-party audio monitoring service. We now monitor all uploaded sound recordings to exclude recordings owned or controlled by the major record labels and any other record labels who provide their music to the third-party audio monitoring service. These record labels register certain of their content with our service provider. When audio is uploaded to our Platform, we check the service provider’s system to exclude recordings owned or controlled by these record labels from being published on our Platform. If our monitoring proves ineffective or we cease to rely upon a third-party monitoring service to exclude certain content from our Platform, our risk of liability may increase.\nIn the past, certain record companies and music publishers, either directly or through their authorized representatives, claimed that we are subject to liability for allegedly infringing content that was uploaded and may continue to exist on our Platform. We vigorously disputed such claims of infringement by such labels and publishers and reached settlements. However, we could be subject to additional claims in the future. An adverse judgment against us in any such lawsuit could require us to settle any claims for an undetermined amount which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may also be required to enter into license agreements with various licensors, including record labels, music publishers, performing rights organizations, and collective management organizations, to obtain licenses that authorize the storage and use of content uploaded by our users. We may not be able to develop technological solutions to comply with these license agreements on economically reasonable terms and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into agreements with all relevant rights holders on terms that we deem reasonable. Compliance may therefore negatively impact our financial prospects.\nThe EU enacted copyright laws such as the Copyright Directive that came into effect on June 6, 2019, that may require us to use best efforts in accordance with the high industry standards of professional diligence to exclude infringing content from our Platform that may be uploaded by our users. In addition, the monitoring and reporting obligations of the DSA may apply also with respect to copyright infringements that would fall outside the scope of the Copyright Directive.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, the activities of our users, or the content of the experiences on our Platform could subject us to liability and harm our business.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes, costs, and awards of damages and/or injunctive relief as a result of these disputes, and we are subject to liability for our intellectual property that we license to third parties. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our Platform without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, there is no assurance that our technologies or Platform will not be found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. We also have entered into agreements with third parties to manufacture and distribute merchandise based on user content on our Platform, and there is a possibility that such content could be found to be infringing. Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management’s time and attention. Further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. Companies in the internet, technology, and gaming industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As we face increasing competition and gain a higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights and other claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, many companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them.\nWe have a number of issued patents. We have also filed a number of additional U.S. and foreign patent applications, but these applications may not successfully result in issued patents. Any patent litigation against us may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue, and therefore, our patents and patent applications may provide little or no deterrence as we would not be able to reach meaningful damages if we assert them against such entities or individuals. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from exercising intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we could be forced to limit or cease access to our Platform or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. In addition, we may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. We may be required to make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement fees, damages, royalties, license, or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any intellectual property claim asserted against us, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to cease selling or using or to recall products that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate; make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages; obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or redesign or rebrand the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible.\nFurthermore, certain federal statutes in the U.S. may apply to us with respect to various activities of our users, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”). For example, we filter communications to eliminate speech we determine to be offensive based on our objective of creating a civil and safe place for all users. Bills have recently been proposed in Congress calling for a range of changes to Section 230 of the CDA which include a complete repudiation of the statute to modifications of it in such a way as to remove certain social media companies from its protection. The FCC may also consider reforms to Section 230 of the CDA, which could include taking action to limit the scope of Section 230 of the CDA and certain liability protections provided to online service providers and other entities. The U.S. Supreme Court has also heard two cases in its most recent term that may result in substantial changes to the scope of protection provided to interactive computer services such as Roblox. If Section 230 of the CDA were so repealed, amended, or modified by judicial determination we could potentially be subject to liability if we continue to censor speech, even if that speech were offensive to our users, or we could experience a decrease in user activity and revenues if we are unable to maintain a safe environment for our users if certain blocking and screening activities are prohibited by law. In addition, certain states have either passed or are debating laws that would create potential liability for moderating or removing certain user content. While we believe these laws are of dubious validity under the U.S. Constitution and in light of Section 230 of the CDA, they nevertheless present some risk to our content-moderation efforts going forward.\nWhile we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the DMCA, the CDA, the fair-use doctrine in the U.S. and the DSA in the EU, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, requirements to maintain immunity, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by developers, creators, or users or otherwise contributed by third parties to our Platform. As an example, Article 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market was passed in the EU, which affords copyright owners some enforcement rights that may conflict with U.S. safe harbor protections afforded to us under the DMCA. Member states in the EU are in the process of determining how Article 17 will be implemented in their particular country. In addition, the EU’s DSA became fully applicable on February 17, 2024. The DSA imposes additional obligations as provided under the E-Commerce Directive and includes new content moderation obligations, notice and transparency obligations, advertising restrictions and other requirements on digital platforms to protect consumers and their rights online. In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are no similar statutes to the CDA or the DSA. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform fails to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Although these and other similar legal provisions provide limited protections from liability for platforms like ours, if we are found not to be protected by the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, CDA or other similar laws, or if we are deemed subject to laws in other countries that may not have the same protections or that may impose more onerous obligations on us, including Article 17, we may owe substantial damages, and our brand, reputation, and financial results may be harmed.\nAdditionally, any content used to create, or created by using, generative AI tools may not be subject to copyright protection, the determination of which may adversely affect our intellectual property rights in, or ability to commercialize or use, such tools or the content. In the United States, a number of civil lawsuits have been initiated related to the foregoing and other issues, the outcome of any one of which may, amongst other things, require us to limit the ways in which we use AI in our business. While AI-related lawsuits to date have generally focused on the AI service providers themselves, our use of any output produced by generative AI tools may expose us to claims, increasing our risks of liability.\nEven if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results. Moreover, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. We expect that the occurrence of asserted infringement claims will grow as the market for our Platform grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase, and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nSome of our agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify these third parties for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services, Platform, or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we typically contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, those limitations may not be fully enforceable in all situations, and we may still incur substantial liability under the applicable agreements. Any dispute with a third-party with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with such a party and harm our business and results of operations.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement would harm our business.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary software technology, our know-how, and our brand. We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, service marks, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, or fail to continuously innovate and advance our technology, our competitors could gain access to our proprietary technology and develop and commercialize substantially identical products, services, or technologies. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense and may not ultimately be successful.\nFurther, any patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated or held unenforceable through administrative processes, including re-examination, inter partes review, interference and derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition proceedings or litigation. In addition, despite our pending patent applications, there is no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents issued from pending or future patent applications or licensed to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our Platform and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available. The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, litigation or other actions may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. As we expand our global activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our Platform and proprietary information will likely increase.\nWe rely, in part, on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. While we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties, including suppliers and other partners, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with every entity that has or may have had access to our proprietary information, know-how, and trade secrets or that has or may have developed intellectual property in connection with an engagement with us. Moreover, there are no assurances that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering, or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how, and trade secrets. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our Platform. These agreements may be breached, and we may not be able to detect any such breach and may not have adequate remedies for any such breach even if we know about it.\nWe use open source software as part of, and in connection with certain experiences on, our Platform, which may pose particular intellectual property and security risks to and could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future continue to use open source software in our codebase and our Platform. Some open source software licenses require users who make available open source software as part of their proprietary software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such proprietary software or make available any derivative works of such software free of charge, under open source licensing terms. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. Enforcement activity for open source licenses can also be unpredictable. Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, defend claims, pay damages for breach of contract or copyright infringement, grant licenses to our patents, re-engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could negatively impact our business. Open source compliance problems can also result in damage to reputation and challenges in recruitment or retention of engineering personnel. Although we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open-source software that are designed to avoid subjecting our Platform to open source licensing conditions, those policies and procedures may not be effective to detect or address all such conditions.\nAdditionally, although we devote significant resources to ensuring the security of our use of open source software on our Platform, we cannot ensure that these security measures will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our open source software may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, theft, system malfunctions, or other adverse events.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe public trading price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could decline regardless of our operating performance.\nTo date, the public trading price of our Class A common stock has been volatile, similar to other newly public companies that have historically experienced highly volatile trading prices. The public trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors, including those listed in this financial report, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the public trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n•the number of shares of our Class A common stock made available for trading;\n•sales or expectations with respect to sales of shares of our Class A common stock by holders of our Class A common stock including our directors, officers, and significant holders;\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n•volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n•failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•any plans we may have to provide or not provide disclosure about certain key metrics, financial guidance, or projections, which may increase the probability that our financial results are perceived as not in line with analysts’ expectations;\n•if we do provide disclosure about certain key metrics, financial guidance, or projections, any changes to such reported items due to changes in our methodology or underlying assumptions for those items and with respect to timing or our failure to meet those projections;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of new services or Platform features;\n•the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n•rumors, market speculation, and media reports involving us or other companies in our industry;\n•actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n•actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n•litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n•actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\n•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\n•new laws or regulations, public expectations regarding new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n•any significant change in our management or other key personnel;\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East stemming from Hamas’ attack against Israel, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, or wildfires, earthquakes or severe weather and power outages or responses to these events; and\n•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, stock markets, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. In addition, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nThe dual class stock structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control in David Baszucki, our Founder, President, CEO, and Chair of our Board of Directors, which limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction.\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Founder, President, CEO, Chair of our Board of Directors, and largest stockholder, David Baszucki, and his affiliates, beneficially own 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock, together as a single class, representing a substantial percentage of the voting power of our capital stock, which voting power may increase over time as Mr. Baszucki exercises or vests in his equity awards. Mr. Baszucki and his affiliates could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. We believe we are eligible for, but do not intend to take advantage of, the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile trading price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. The dual class structure of our common stock may trigger actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure, which could result in the trading price of our Class A common stock being adversely affected. Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts or other third parties do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe market price and trading volume for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts and other third parties publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations or incorrect. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, third parties regularly publish data about us and other mobile, gaming, and social platform companies with respect to DAUs, revenue, bookings, top experience, or game charts, hours engaged and other information concerning social game application usage. These metrics are proprietary to the provider, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of bookings, revenue, or usage of our experiences across all platforms. There is a possibility that third parties could change their methodologies for calculating these metrics in the future. For example, short sellers have and may in the future publish reports relying in part on such metrics. These reports appear intended to decrease the price of our Class A common stock and have resulted in and may result in claims, litigation, or investigations due to any published allegations by shareholders, regulators, and others. To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, including reports of short sellers, the price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may not reflect the performance of our business.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n•any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws will require the approval of at least 66 2/3% of our then-outstanding voting power;\n•our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and stockholders will only be able to remove directors from office for cause;\n•upon the conversion of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\n•our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\n•vacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;\n•a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our CEO, our President, or a majority of our Board of Directors;\n•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n•our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes 100 million shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following (except for any claim as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction):\n•any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us;\n•any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty;\n•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); and\n•any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. We also note that stockholders cannot waive compliance (or consent to noncompliance) with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, you may need to rely on sales of our Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations, including our obligations under the 2030 Notes.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 2030 Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the 2030 Notes, and other obligations.\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend on various factors, including the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates, less favorable terms, or may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms (if at all) or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. \nOur indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us.\nOur indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us, including the following:\n•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2030 Notes and our other indebtedness;\n•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries’ debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n•requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in the Indenture, which limit the manner in which we conduct our business;\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;\n•increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nGeneral Risks\nIf we are unable to maintain effective disclosure and internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations may be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our disclosure controls and other procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes. If these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that may arise. We have identified in the past, and may identify in the future, deficiencies in our controls, which could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. If we are not able to, or if we are perceived as being unable to, comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to, or if we are perceived as being unable to, maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and we have been and could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports. \nAny legal proceedings or claims against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.\nWe are and/or may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property, privacy, biometrics, cybersecurity, data protection, product liability, consumer protection, false and misleading advertising, employment, class action, whistleblower, contract, securities, tort, civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, human trafficking, unfair competition, and other litigation claims, including claims related to our advertising practices and use of generative AI, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. We are and may continue to be subject to legal proceedings asserting claims arising from allegations that we have facilitated gambling by users of our Platform including by minors, that we have misrepresented the safety of our Platform, that our Platform is addictive or otherwise unsafe, that we unlawfully or unfairly benefit from child labor, and that we have misrepresented information about our user base, that we have engaged in copyright infringement, that we have engaged in unlawful employment practices, and suits related to our refund policies. In lawsuits brought on behalf of child users, the court may allow minors to disaffirm or avoid enforcement of our Terms of Use, depending on the circumstances. We have and may continue to be subject to legal proceedings asserting claims on behalf of shareholders related to allegations that discussions of our growth prospects have been misleading and unsustainable due to concerns related to safety and our implementation of parental controls on the Platform and claims that our leadership has engaged in insider trading. In particular, on August 1, 2023, a putative class action was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California captioned Colvin v. Roblox asserting various claims arising from allegations that minors used third-party virtual casinos to gamble Robux and on March 14, 2024, Gentry v. Roblox was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California premised on substantially identical allegations as Colvin v. Roblox. The two cases were consolidated on April 18, 2024. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, or require us to change our business practices. The expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have our headquarters and a large employee presence in San Mateo, California, an area which in recent years has been increasingly susceptible to fires, severe weather events, and power outages, any of which could disrupt our operations, and which contains active earthquake zones. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, rolling blackouts or power loss, telecommunications failure, pandemic, geopolitical conflict such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East stemming from Hamas’ attack against Israel, cyber-attack, war, other physical security threats or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our Platform development, lengthy interruptions in our Platform, breaches of security, and loss of critical data, all of which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Acts of terrorism and similar events would also cause disruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole. Global climate change could also result in natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, which could cause business interruptions. The long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery from it on society and developer, creator, and user engagement remain uncertain, and a subsequent health crisis or pandemic, as well as the actions taken by various governmental, business and individuals in response, will impact our business, operations and financial results in ways that we may not be able to accurately predict. In addition, the insurance we maintain would likely not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions. Our disaster recovery plan may not be sufficient to address all aspects of any unanticipated consequence or incident, we may not be able to maintain business continuity at profitable levels or at all, and our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur.\nOur operations are subject to the effects of changing inflation rates and volatile global economic conditions.\nThe United States, Europe, and other key global markets have recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. If the inflation rate continues to increase, it will likely affect all of our expenses, including, but not limited to, employee compensation expenses and energy expenses and it may reduce consumer discretionary spending, which could affect the buying power of our users, developers, and creators and lead to a reduced demand for our Platform.\nGeopolitical developments, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East stemming from the Hamas attack against Israel, and tensions with China, and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including lower consumer confidence, persistent unemployment, wage and income stagnation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, changes in interest rates, currency fluctuations, economic and trade sanctions, the availability and cost of credit, and the strength of the economies in which we and our users are located, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) insurance limit. If the financial conditions affecting the banking industry and financial markets cause additional banks and financial institutions to enter receivership or become insolvent, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, or to draw on our existing lines of credit, may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",
