      "text": "Item 1. Business.\nOverview\nKratos is a technology, hardware, products, system and software company addressing the defense, national security, and commercial markets. Kratos makes true internally funded research, development, capital and other investments, to rapidly develop, produce and field systems and solutions that address our customers’ and partners’ mission critical needs and requirements. At Kratos, affordability is a technology, and we seek to utilize proven, leading edge approaches and technology, not unproven bleeding edge approaches or technology, with Kratos’ approach designed to reduce cost, schedule and risk, enabling us to be first to market with cost effective solutions. We believe that Kratos is known as the innovative disruptive change agent in the industry, a company that is an expert in designing hardware products and systems up front for successful rapid, large quantity, low cost future manufacturing, which is a value add competitive differentiator for our large traditional prime system integrator partners and also to our government and commercial customers. At Kratos, we strive to deliver more for less to our customers and partners. Kratos intends to pursue program and contract opportunities as the prime or lead contractor when we believe our probability of win is high and any investment required by Kratos is within our capital resource comfort level. We intend to partner and team with a large, traditional system integrator when our assessment of probability of win is greater or required investment is beyond Kratos comfort level. Kratos’ primary business areas include, virtualized ground systems for satellites and space vehicles, including software for command and control (C2) and telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C), space domain awareness, jet powered unmanned aerial drone systems, hypersonic vehicles and rocket systems, propulsion systems for drones, missiles, loitering munitions, supersonic systems, space craft and launch systems, command, control, communication, computing, combat, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (C5ISR) and microwave electronic products for missile, radar, air defense, missile defense, space, satellite, counter unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS), directed energy, communication and other systems, and virtual and augmented reality training systems for the warfighter. We believe that there is a generational recapitalization of weapon systems occurring globally, including with the United States and its allies, \nto address individual and potential collective peer and near peer threats, including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, or the so-called Axis of Resistance. The Company currently has at or near record levels of backlog and opportunity pipeline. The Company is currently making significant capital, property, plant, equipment and other internally funded investments to address its current backlog, current opportunity pipeline, and current and expected potential future program and contract awards, including from or with the Department of Defense and traditional legacy prime system integrators and partners. These investments include: unmanned jet powered aircraft such as Kratos Valkyrie to be manufactured ahead of potential contract award; a hypersonic system fabrication, production, test and integration campus and facility in conjunction with our customer, where a significant amount of work under the new Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) 2.0 contract award will be performed, including for Kratos Zeus solid rocket motors (SRMs) and Erinyes hypersonic flight systems; the purchase of long lead items for up to 60 Oriole SRMs for ballistic missile defense-related, hypersonic or other expected customer missions; expansion of our small turbojet engine production capacity in Michigan; establishment of a planned small turbofan jet engine production facility in the United States; expansion of our existing microwave electronics manufacturing facility and capabilities in Israel, establishment of an additional microwave electronics facility in Israel; including a space qualified facility; expansion of our machining, milling, casting, 3D printing and additive manufacturing capable facility in the United States to support our jet engine and other product and system manufacturing requirements; establishment of a new facility related to the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program; expansion of our unmanned jet drone manufacturing capability; and expansion of existing and construction of additional classified facilities for certain programs and contracts. \nWe were incorporated in the state of New York on December 19, 1994 and began operations in March 1995. We reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1998.\nIndustry Update \n\nOn March 22, 2024, President Biden signed the second fiscal year 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package into law. This legislation reflects an $886 billion appropriation for national defense, of which $842 billion would be for the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) base budget. On April 24, 2024, President Biden signed a bill providing a total of $95.3 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restocking of U.S. munitions capacity, and a fourth bill to impose sanctions and allow the use of seized Russian assets to assist Ukraine. \nOn March 11, 2024, President Biden submitted the fiscal year 2025 budget request to Congress. The request included $895 billion for national defense, of which approximately $850 billion is for the DoD base budget. On May 22, 2024, the House Armed Services Committee approved the fiscal year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. The bill authorizes $849.8 billion in funding for the DoD. On June 28, 2024, the House passed the fiscal year 2025 DoD Appropriations bill H.R. 8774. On July 8, 2024, the Senate Armed Service Committee filed their version of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act at a level $25 billion above the President’s budget request. \nThe Federal fiscal year 2024 ended September 30, 2024, without Congress approving, nor the President signing into law, a Federal fiscal 2025 budget, including the National Security and Department of Defense Budgets. As a result of no Federal fiscal 2025 budget being approved, beginning October 1, 2024, the U.S. Federal Government is currently operating under a Continuing Resolution Authorization (“CRA”), under which, no new contract awards, no increases in existing contract funding, no increases in existing production contracts and no transition from development to production, among other items, can occur. A second CRA passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by President Biden on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. Government operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. The final version of this bill did not address the debt ceiling, which was set to expire on January 1, 2025. The U.S. Treasury’s available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. \nOn November 5, 2024, the U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections occurred, with Donald Trump being elected President of the United States and the Republican party controlling the Senate and the House of Representatives. President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, and the new Congress and Senate were seated on January 3, 2025. As a result of these recent elections, the current Fiscal 2025 CRA could be significantly extended beyond the current March 14 extension date. There is also the possibility that the industry could experience a full year CRA related to Federal fiscal 2025, with no Federal fiscal 2025 budget enacted. Subsequent to his taking office, President Trump established The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by billionaire Elon Musk, with DOGE’s Mission to slash federal spending. In February 2025, President Trump stated that he has directed DOGE to review Pentagon spending for possible waste and fraud. President Trump has also indicated that he may pursue significant reductions to the U.S. defense budget, if both Russia and China would agree to similar \ncuts in their respective national security spending. The potential impact of DOGE ant the President’s potential intentions on the Defense and National Security industry, and the Company, if any, is unknown at this time.\nThe potential challenges presented by the recent elections, Presidential and congressional changes and the related transitions, the CRA, the current budgetary and deficit funding environment, Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan funding support, continuing heightened levels of inflation, ongoing supply chain disruption, the challenging appropriations process, and DOGE, among other items, all continue to create significant short and long-term challenges and risks to the industry and the Company. \nWe believe continued budget and deficit funding pressures (which are expected), CRAs (which are also expected), future Federal Government debt ceiling issues, or Federal Government shutdowns, could have serious negative consequences for the security of our country and the defense industrial base, including the Company and the related customers, employees, suppliers, investors, and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. It is possible that budget and program decisions made in such an uncertain environment would have long-term implications for our Company and the entire defense industry. Additionally, funding for certain programs, including those in which we currently participate or are pursuing, may be reduced, delayed or cancelled, and budget uncertainty or funding cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our customers, partners, teammates, subcontractors, suppliers, and our employee base. \nSuch a challenging federal and DoD budgetary environment could have a material adverse effect on our forecasts, estimates, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAs noted, Kratos and the industry continue to be affected by various unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including adverse supply chain disruptions that continue throughout the industry and for us, and related delays in the receipt and delivery of materials, parts, supplies, etc., which in certain instances and for certain items is significant. To mitigate the impact of these delays, we have implemented advanced and larger lot purchases of certain materials and parts which has resulted in an increased use of our working capital, which is expected to continue. In addition, inflation and the related increased cost of inputs needed to execute our business, including materials, parts, supplies, consultants, subcontractors, vendors, etc. have significantly increased our business costs and have adversely impacted our operations, profit margins and financial forecasts. \nAdditionally, an industry wide shortage of qualified labor, and the cost of that labor for the Company and its labor base is an operational challenge. The cost of labor has increased significantly and current challenges in hiring, obtaining and retaining employees, including those employees requiring National Security clearances, is adversely impacting Kratos’ ability to execute its business. There is also a significant industry wide labor and talent shortage, including in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) discipline areas, and also including employees willing and/or able to obtain National Security clearances, and for high level manufacturing and production disciplines.\nIn addition, actions by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in the past few years have impacted our interest expense on our outstanding debt borrowings and the related cost of executing Kratos’ business. Although the most recent actions by the Federal Reserve decreased rates slightly, the industry and Kratos are still impacted by rates that are higher than prevailing interest rates over the past several years. Each of these challenges are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and are expected to continue to adversely impact the Company’s operations, financial results and financial forecasts. \nWe believe that our business is well-positioned in areas that the Trump Administration, the DoD and other customers currently indicate are priorities for future defense spending, and also including as identified in the 2024 defense budget and related Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), the President’s 2025 National Security and Defense Budget Request. As noted above, we believe that there is a generational recapitalization of weapon systems occurring with the U.S. and its allies to address peer and near peer threats, including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and the Company’s positioning as a proven provider of hardware, systems and software to address these threats for and with our customers and partners is recognized in the industry. We believe that the Company’s hardware, software and solution offerings, including jet unmanned aerial drones, rocket and hypersonic systems, C5ISR and air defense systems, jet engine and propulsion systems for missiles, drones, hypersonic and supersonic vehicles, microwave electronics for missile, radar and air defense systems, space and satellite, C2, TT&C, and ADA capabilities and training systems, address mission critical priority areas of the DoD. \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect estimates and assumptions made by management as of December 29, 2024. Events and changes in circumstances arising after December 29, 2024, including those resulting from the continuing impacts of the current unfavorable macroeconomic climate, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.\nCurrent Reporting Segments\n\nThe Company currently operates in two reportable segments. The Kratos Government Solutions (“KGS”) reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, including our microwave electronic products, space, satellite and cyber, training solutions, C5ISR/modular systems, turbine technologies, and defense and rocket support services operating segments. The Unmanned Systems (“US”) reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of US operating segments, including our unmanned aerial, unmanned ground, unmanned seaborne and related command, control and communications system businesses.\nWe organize our operating segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. Transactions between segments are negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts, and these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe that Kratos being a technology company, focused on affordability and the composition and experience of our Board of Directors and Executive management team, our ability to act and make decisions quickly, our culture of rapid innovation and our investments to develop and maintain intellectual property, proprietary products, and technology, are strongly aligned with certain of the highest priority spending areas of the DoD, the U.S. National Security Strategy, and the DoD’s focus on leveraging technology to defeat or deter peer and near-peer adversaries, are competitive advantages. \nAdditionally, we believe Kratos’ strategy of being “first to market” with our hardware systems, products, technology and solutions, is also a competitive differentiator, including in certain areas as compared to the traditional defense industrial complex prime system integrators, as well as venture capital backed defense technology companies. We also believe that our proven ability to rapidly design, develop, demonstrate and field disruptive, transformative and leading technology products and systems, at an affordable cost, also differentiates us from our competitors, both traditional and new. We believe that our reputation, longstanding customer relationships, past-performance qualifications and the designed-in position of our hardware systems, technology and products into our customers’ and partners’ platforms, programs and systems, provide a unique competitive advantage and position us well for future accelerated growth. We routinely partner or team with the large traditional defense industry system integrators when certain opportunities require a significant internally funded investment that Kratos is unwilling to make, or when Kratos believes that teaming significantly increases our probability of win. A recent example of our first to market strategy is our design and development of our low-cost Erinyes, Dark Fury and other hypersonic vehicles and our Zeus solid rocket motors, which have recently had several successful missions.\nKratos’ specialized National Security focus is aligned with mission-critical National Security priorities. Continued and increased concerns related to the threats posed by certain foreign nations, including nations with peer or near peer capabilities, have caused the U.S. Government to identify National Security as an area of enhanced functional and spending priority. Budget pressures, particularly related to DoD spending, have placed a premium on rapidly developing and fielding low-cost, high-technology hardware, systems and solutions, that can be fielded in quantities, i.e. affordable mass, to address National Security requirements. While budget pressures routinely cause delays in contracts or orders for our business, the global threat environment and current budget projections suggest that future years defense spending will continue to be significant, including to address the increasing threats to the United States and its allies. The outlook for defense spending is primarily focused on deterring and defeating our adversaries, power projection, warfighting readiness, lethality, and recapitalization of key strategic defense systems to address peer and near peer threats. We believe that Kratos’ primary capabilities and areas of focus, certain ones which are listed below, are aligned with the objectives of the U.S. Government including those outlined in the 2022 National Defense Strategy document:\n•Unmanned aerial drones, unmanned ground and unmanned seaborne systems and related autonomy and artificial intelligence.\n•Satellite communications, C2, TT&C and Space Domain Awareness capabilities and technology.\n•Microwave electronics, including in support of air defense, missile, radar, space, satellite and communication systems.\n•Electronic warfare, attack, missile, and radar systems.\n•Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology, platforms solutions and systems.\n•Ballistic missile defense, hypersonic and other “High Performance” type systems.\n•C5ISR systems, including Air Defense, Strategic Deterrence Systems and support of the “Strategic Triad”.\n•Cybersecurity and information assurance.\n•Specialized training and operational readiness systems and solutions.\n•Jet engines for drones, missiles and loitering munitions.\n•Rocket engines and propulsion systems for hypersonic, space and other systems.\nIP-centric technology company with proprietary products, technology and systems which address critical current and emerging threats faced by U.S. and allied militaries. As a technology-focused company at the forefront of the DoD’s strategy for technology rich, transformative, disruptive and affordable systems, our current and growing portfolio of proprietary systems, products, solutions, and related intellectual property addresses certain of the most critical mission needs and requirements of U.S. and allied militaries. At Kratos, affordability is a technology, a core competency and a focus that we believe is disruptive and brings an important value proposition to our customers and partners. Kratos business focus areas include: unmanned systems, space and satellite communications, microwave electronics, cybersecurity/warfare, missile defense, hypersonic systems, C5ISR, turbine technologies, jet and rocket engines and training systems. \nTechnology-driven company aligned with and supporting our customers’ increased innovation, technology, and strategic National Security initiatives, with focus on speed and affordability. As the DoD works to increase, maintain or achieve a technological advantage over adversaries, it has continued its efforts to create breakthrough technologies for National Security and related commercial markets, accelerate innovation to the warfighter and repurpose current capabilities to create cost-effective, disruptive technology advances that result in rapidly fielded systems and products in quantity. With our focus on delivering proven leading edge systems, products and technologies that address the most critical current and emerging threats, our customers include some of the most technologically advanced organizations of the defense and National Security establishment, including the U.S. Air Force (USAF), the U.S. Navy (USN), the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), the U.S. Space Force and the U.S. Space Command, and others. Additionally, Kratos customers also include the Defense Innovation Unit (“DIU”) (formerly the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (“DIUx”)), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), Air Force Research Laboratory (“AFRL”), the Strategic Capabilities Office (“SCO”), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (“OSD”), the Strategic Command (“STRATCOM”), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), the Space Development Agency (SDA), the Space Force, the U.S. intelligence community, and other confidential customers. We believe our focus on low cost, constant innovation, capability improvements across our product and solutions portfolio, speed of development, and engineering, design and development for affordable mass production are key differentiators that are disruptive to certain traditional market norms and align us with and address our customers’ and our traditional large defense system integrator partners’ key initiatives.\nIn-depth understanding of customer missions. We believe that Kratos has a reputation for being an industry disruptor, including by successfully rapidly designing, developing, demonstrating and fielding mission-critical products, hardware, solutions and services to our customers, at an affordable cost. Our long-term relationships with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and other National Security-related customers and agencies, and commercial and other customers and entities, enable us to develop an in-depth understanding of their missions, problems and technical requirements. In addition, a substantial number of our employees are located at our customer locations, or at secure manufacturing and other secure facilities, all of which provides Kratos with valuable strategic insight into our customers’ ongoing missions and future program and mission requirements. We are also closely aligned with most of the traditional, large, system integrator defense companies. This understanding of our customers’ and partners’ missions, requirements, and needs, in conjunction with the strategic location of our employees, enables us to offer technical solutions tailored to our customers’ and partners’ specific requirements and evolving mission objectives. In addition, once our products are “designed in” to a program or system and we are on-site with a customer and providing our hardware, software, products and solutions, we have historically been successful in winning new and recompete business. \nRelevant Products, Systems and Solutions\nWe believe that Kratos is an industry leader of high performance, jet powered unmanned aerial target drone systems, which represent certain of the highest performance jet powered unmanned aerial aircraft in the world. Kratos is the primary provider of jet target drone systems to the USN, with the BQM-177, the USAF with the BQM-167, and the U.S. Army with the MQM-178. In addition to the United States Armed Services, Kratos sells its target drones to numerous allied countries globally. Kratos is currently under contract with a U.S. Government Agency for a Next Generation Target Drone (5GAT). Kratos is currently in sole source production year 20 for the BQM-167 with the USAF, sole source production year 7 with the USN for BQM-177, and single source production year 12, with the U.S. Army for MQM-178.\nKratos also provides Kratos Mako high performance jet powered tactical unmanned drone, which flew manned/unmanned teaming missions with a USMC manned fighter aircraft in 2015. Kratos’ Fifth Generation Stealth Valkyrie tactical drone systems have flown with the USAF and USMC, is under contract with the USMC and is currently involved with the USMC project Eagle. Other Kratos jet powered tactical drones flying today, include Thanatos, Apollo, Athena, and Air Wolf, each of which is currently under a customer funded contract. Kratos’ tactical drones are recognized for their extreme high performance, low cost and ability to be rapidly fielded. The new Trump Administration, the new Secretary of Defense and other Trump Administration leadership have indicated their support and the potential for increased future funding for unmanned aerial drone systems and related autonomy and artificial intelligence systems.\nWe believe that Kratos is an industry leader in affordable rocket systems and SRMs which are specifically designed and developed for low cost ballistic missile target, hypersonic, sub orbital and other National Security related missions. Kratos is also a recognized industry leader in low cost hypersonic flight vehicles, ballistic missile targets and “other” systems. Over the past few years, Kratos has been in development on a new solid rocket motor system, Zeus (Zeus 1 and Zeus 2), and related hypersonic flight vehicle systems, including Erinyes and Dark Fury, each of which Kratos has made significant internally funded investments for rapid development, fielding and a first to market position. In November 2024, Kratos announced that Zeus 1 and Zeus 2 SRMs had completed their first successful flight on October 24, 2024, from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia under a customer funded mission. In June 2024, Kratos announced the successful launch and flight of the Kratos Erinyes hypersonic flyer, also under a customer funded mission. The exercise, designated Hypersonic Test Bed-1 (HTB-1), demonstrated hypersonic flight that enabled the collection of data for multiple experiments to be provided to test teams for design and evaluation of new technologies. In February 2025, Kratos announced the second successful flight of the Erinyes Hypersonic flight system in conjunction with its government customers.\nSubsequent to the successful initial flights of the Zeus SRM’s and the Erinyes hypersonic system, Kratos was awarded the Mach TB 2.0 hypersonic system related contract, the largest contract in Kratos history with an estimated value of $1.45 billion, if all options are exercised over a five-year period.\nKratos is a recognized industry leader in the rapid development of low cost jet engines for missiles, drones and other systems. Kratos’ engine and propulsion teams are also recognized as industry leaders in the design, engineering and development of hypersonic, space and supersonic propulsion systems, including Kratos being the engine development lead for Boom Supersonics (Concorde commercial supersonic jet replacement) Overture’s aircraft engines, the Symphony.\nWe believe that Kratos is also an industry leader in hardware, products, systems and microwave electronics for numerous air defense, missile, radar, nuclear, strategic and other systems, including; Iron Dome, Iron Sting, Arrow, Patriot, THAAD, IBCS, IFPC and others. \nWe believe that Kratos is also an industry leader in ground-based command, control and communications systems (“C3”), Telemetry Tracking and Control (“TT&C”) and other systems for satellites, and a leader in related radio frequency interference identification, geolocation and mitigation, or Space Domain Awareness. Our primary customers include the U.S. Air Force, Space Command, Space Development and other agencies, and also commercial customers, enterprises and entities. \nWe also believe that our advanced capabilities in the training systems and solutions market, including mixed, virtual and synthetic reality technology, products and systems for aircraft, combat and other vehicles, have allowed us to successfully remain at the forefront of defense industry readiness initiatives. \nWe believe our strategy of internally funding the research and development of many of our systems, products, software, solutions and capabilities, will continue to enable Kratos to be “first to market”, ahead of the competition and advance our position in high growth markets, such as high performance UCAVs, turbine and engine technologies, hypersonic systems, ballistic missile targets, microwave electronics and satellite communications, and allow us to grow, over the long-term, at a rate greater than that of the industry.\nDiverse base of key contracts with low concentration. Kratos’ leading hardware, technology, products and systems, which are focused on many of the highest priority National Security areas allows us the opportunity to bid on and pursue a large number of contract and program opportunities as the lead or prime contractor, while also providing Kratos the opportunity to partner or team on additional large opportunities, better positioning our Company for success. Many of our contracts are single-award and/or sole source in nature, where we or our team are the only awardee by the customer. In certain cases, our ability to obtain single award and/or sole source contracts is due to our intellectual property, proprietary products, historical performance qualifications, relative experience, affordability or Kratos already having demonstrated a first to market working system. \nWe have a highly diverse base of customers and contracts with no contract representing more than 6% of 2024 revenue. Our fixed-price contracts, the majority of which are production contracts, represent approximately 69% of our 2024 revenue. Our cost-plus-fee contracts and time and materials contracts represent approximately 25% and 6%, respectively, of our 2024 revenue. We believe our diverse base of key contracts and low reliance on any one contract provides us with a stable, balanced revenue stream. \nRepresentative recent major contract awards for Kratos include the $1.45 billion MACH-TB 2.0 contract award, if all options are exercised over a five-year period, to support the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to support OUSD’s National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0 by creating an affordable flight test bed to rapidly increase hypersonic flight test capacity, a $34.8 million contract from the USMC for Valkyrie mission system integration, a $116.7 million prime contract to create and operate an Advanced Fire Control Ground Infrastructure (AFCGI) from the U.S. Space Development Agency, an approximate $100 million total potential value hypersonic system program award, a $48 million contract for geolocation global support services, a $45 million award related to a new satellite system, a $79.8 million contract (Lot 20) for 60 BQM-167A Target aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, a $57.6 million contract for 70 BQM-177A Aerial Targets for the U.S. Navy, a $499 million multiple award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for the design, build, test, and delivery of functioning anti-tamper solutions, a $579 million single award IDIQ, if all options are exercised, for Space Force SATCOM C2 System for the Command and Control (C2) System Consolidated (CCS-C) Sustainment and Resiliency (C-SAR), and an $877 million IDIQ, multiple award sounding rocket award to provide suborbital launch services and launch support. \nSignificant cash flow visibility driven by stable backlog. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total backlog (see “Backlog” below) was approximately $1,445.1 million and $1,243.9 million respectively, of which approximately $1,090.1 million was funded in 2024 and $944.6 million was funded in 2023. The majority of our sales are from awards issued under long-term contracts, typically three to five years in duration. Our contract backlog provides visibility into stable future revenue and cash flow over a diverse set of contracts. Importantly, a number of our systems and products are designed-in and support long term, multi-year/multi-decade programs, which provides significant operational and financial visibility to our Company.\nHighly skilled employees and an experienced management team. We deliver our systems, products and services through a skilled and primarily engineering and technically oriented workforce of approximately 4,000 employees. Our executives and senior managers have significant experience with technology companies, commercial enterprises, U.S. Government agencies, the U.S. military, U.S. Government contractors and other relevant entities. A significant number of Kratos employees hold National Security clearances. Members of our management team have experience growing commercial, technology and national security focused businesses both organically and through acquisitions and delivering significant value to investors, shareholders and stakeholders. We believe that the cumulative experience and differentiated expertise of our personnel in our core focus areas, coupled with our sizable and technically oriented employee base, allow us to qualify for and bid on larger programs and contracts in a prime contracting role.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to be a leading technology, hardware, systems, software and products provider to the defense, national security and relevant commercial and related global markets, and to disrupt our market focus areas, by being first to market with internally funded and developed offerings, engineered and designed to be mass produced at an affordable cost. In executing our strategy, Kratos primarily seeks to utilize proven technology, which we modify, adopt, change, integrate and apply to address market opportunities that we identify jointly with our customers and with our partners. This approach allows us to rapidly develop and field relevant offerings, while reducing technical, schedule and financial risk. At Kratos, “affordability is a technology”, and “better is the enemy of good enough”, which we believe are critical elements of the successful execution of our strategy. Additionally, whenever there is a defense/security/commercial “multi use” opportunity for our technology, products and systems, we lever off of this opportunity with increased efficiencies and further reduced cost opportunity via increased quantities provided to dual or multiple markets.\nInternal Growth\nWe are focused on generating internal growth by capitalizing on our ability to rapidly develop, demonstrate and field leading technology systems and products at an affordable cost and by being “first to market” with our offerings. We make targeted discretionary investments in mission critical DoD, National Security and related commercial opportunity priority areas in order to achieve our first to market objective. Primary Kratos business areas include unmanned systems, space and satellite communications, cybersecurity, microwave electronics, hypersonic and rocket systems, missile defense, jet engines, rocket motors, turbine technologies and propulsion systems, and training systems, which we believe have the highest potential for \ngrowth, including as based on the recent Fiscal 2025 National Security budget submittal and National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). In certain areas, Kratos will retain important intellectual property as a result of the internally funded investments we have made. Additionally, due to Kratos’ unique technology, product and potential intellectual property positions, including in the space, satellite, UAS, propulsion, engine, turbine, rocket, hypersonic and other areas, we are routinely approached to partner or team on large, new program and contract opportunities, where Kratos offerings and affordability are an important competitive differentiator. A key aspect of Kratos’ internal growth philosophy is also that “it is better to have a large part of something, than all of nothing”, which is directly relevant to our teaming and partnership approach and strategy, including with the traditional large aerospace and defense system integrators.\nExpand technology product, solution and service offerings provided to existing customers. We are focused on expanding the technology, products, systems and solutions we provide to our customers by making targeted internally funded investments in certain core focus areas, by leveraging our strong relationships, technical capabilities, intellectual property and past performance qualifications and by offering a wider range of comprehensive low-cost technology leading and proven products and solutions compared to our competitors. In regard to areas of specialization, our product and solution offerings include the manufacturing of specialized defense electronics; integrated technology and software solutions for satellite command, control and communications; specialized high performance UCAV and drone aircraft for tactical and threat representation target purposes; Unmanned Ground Systems (“UGS”); Unmanned Seaborne Systems; engine and propulsion systems; and rocket, ballistic missile target and hypersonic systems. We believe our understanding of customer needs, missions, requirements and processes, our reputation and past performance qualifications and our ability to rapidly deliver low cost, technology leading hardware, systems, products and solutions, position us well for success in the current National Security and geopolitical threat environment.\nCapitalize on current contract base. We are pursuing new program and contract opportunities and awards as we build the business with our expanding technology base, intellectual property ownership, contract portfolio, and product, hardware, solution, software, service offerings and past performance qualifications. We are also aggressively pursuing several National Security priority areas, including high performance UCAVS, satellite communications command, control, communication and signal monitoring products, SDA, satellite microwave electronics for missiles, radars, electronic warfare and communications, cybersecurity solutions, propulsion and engine systems, specialized training systems, autonomy and artificial intelligence systems, robotics, directed energy systems, hypersonic systems and next generation ballistic missile targets. Additionally, we are assessing new program areas and platforms to pursue that are consistent with our core capabilities, technology and intellectual property. These current and existing programs, contracts, customers and related offerings provide Kratos important past performance qualifications and experience, positioning us to credibly pursue new opportunities.\nExpand customer and contract base. We are focused on expanding our customer base into areas with significant growth opportunities, including as indicated by the fiscal year 2024 spending bill, the Fiscal 2025 NDAA and the Trump Administration’s initial indicated priority areas, by leveraging our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products, capabilities, industry reputation, past performance qualifications, long-term customer relationships and diverse contract base. We also believe that our ability to rapidly develop, demonstrate and field high technology systems and products, at an affordable cost, is a clear competitive differentiator for our Company. We anticipate that this overall expansion in our capabilities will enable us to pursue larger program opportunities, higher value work and to further diversify our revenue base across additional U.S. Government, international and commercial customers.\nImprove operating margins. We believe that we have opportunities to increase our operating margins and improve profitability in the future as we transition from certain development programs, which typically generate inherently lower margins, to production programs, which typically generate higher margins, and by leveraging our corporate infrastructure investments as our business and revenues increase. We are proactively focused on continuously improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and concentrating our efforts on operational excellence.\nInvest and Partner in strategic growth areas. Over the past several years, we have made significant internally funded investments in strategic growth areas, including unmanned tactical aircraft drone systems, space and satellite communication software and systems, rocket engines and hypersonic systems, jet engines, turbine and other engine technologies. Specifically, we have increased internally funded research and development, capital and other expenditures, non-recurring engineering expenditures, and infrastructure investments, including executive management, bid, proposal and new business capture, pursuit and related expenses. We have made these investments with the intention of developing, demonstrating, fielding, bringing to production and being first to market in these strategic growth areas. These internally funded investments typically allow us to retain certain intellectual property rights, design and data packages, for these platforms, software and systems, including to ultimately secure sole source technology or production positions in these strategic growth areas. Specifically, since 2013, we have invested over $260 million in our UAS business and since 2019, approximately $252 million in our Space, Satellite and Cyber business, and made investments of approximately $25 million in rocket and hypersonic systems, and engine and turbine \ntechnology areas, through internally funded research, development, contract design retrofit costs, contract design costs for new platforms, software design and development, non-recurring engineering costs and capital expenditures related to these strategic growth areas.\n•Since 2019, we have invested approximately $252 million in Kratos’ Space, Satellite and Cyber business through internally funded research and development, software design and development and capital expenditures, primarily related to our next generation, software based, virtualized satellite C2, TT&C, and other ground-based OpenSpace™ communications systems, which we released “first to market” in 2021, and our global SDA system. Related to certain of these investments, in 2022, we received an approximate $160 million potential contract award from Blue Halo and a significant contract award from Intelsat as a result of Kratos OpenSpace™ products and technology. In 2023, we introduced the satellite industry’s first open edge terminal for satellite communications and other applications and we announced that our OpenSpace platform is the first commercially available, fully virtualized satellite ground system to achieve MEF 3.0 Carrier Ethernet certification. In 2024, we received a number of contract awards including a $48 million contract for geolocation global support services, a $116.7 million contract from the U.S. Space Development Agency for Ground System to support advanced fire control missions and a $579 million single award IDIQ for Space Form Satcom C2 System. \n•During 2024 we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with GE Aerospace to partner on the development and production of small affordable engines that could potentially power unmanned aerial systems, collaborative combat aircraft, missile, drone and similar applications. The agreement, once finalized, will replace an existing joint development agreement and which includes a sole-source full-scale engine production position for Kratos. For the last year, GE Aerospace and Kratos have been working together on a small affordable engine.\n•Over the past few years, Kratos has been in development on a new solid rocket motor system, Zeus (Zeus 1 and Zeus 2), and related hypersonic flight vehicle systems, Erinyes and Dark Fury, all of which Kratos has internally funded through investments totaling $25 million for rapid development, fielding and a first to market position. In November 2024, Kratos announced that Zeus 1 and Zeus 2 SRMs had completed their first successful flight on October 24, 2024, from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia under a customer funded mission. In June 2024, Kratos announced the successful launch and flight of the Kratos Erinyes hypersonic flyer, also under a customer funded mission. The exercise, designated Hypersonic Test Bed-1 (HTB-1), demonstrated hypersonic flight that enabled the collection of data for multiple experiments to be provided to test teams for design and evaluation of new technologies. Subsequent to the successful flights of the Zeus SRMs and the Erinyes hypersonic system, Kratos was awarded the Mach TB 2.0 Hypersonic System related contract, the largest contract in Kratos history at $1.45 billion, if all options are exercised over a five-year period.\nCapitalize on corporate infrastructure investments. In recent periods, we have made significant investments in our senior and technical management and corporate infrastructure related to cybersecurity threats to our Company, increased and changing regulations we are subject to, and the changing National Security industry environment. These investments also included hiring senior executives and managers with significant experience in the National Security and technology industries, hiring firms to support us on Capitol Hill, Congressionally and with our customers, strengthening our internal controls over financial reporting and accounting staff in support of increasing public company reporting requirements, expanding our infrastructure in response to increases in cybersecurity protection and related regulatory requirements, including the DoD’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”) requirement for all federal contractors, and expanding our backlog and bid and proposal pipeline resources. We have also made significant investments in secure facilities to enable us to bid on, successfully receive and execute on classified programs and opportunities. As a result of these and other investments, we expect to be allocating additional resources in our pursuit of new, larger and highly technical prime contract opportunities. We believe our management experience, technical capabilities, manufacturing, production and corporate infrastructure can support a company with a much larger revenue base than we currently have. Accordingly, we believe that, to the extent our revenue grows, we will be able to leverage this infrastructure base and increase our operating margins.\nCustomers\nA representative list of government customers in our KGS and US segments during 2024 included the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Missile Defense Agency, Space Command, Space Force, NASA, the AFRL, foreign military sales (“FMS”), the U.S. Southern Command, STRATCOM, the SCO, DIU or DIUx, the Rapid Capabilities Offices, the U.S. intelligence community, DARPA, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and certain confidential customers. A representative list of non-government customers during 2024 included tier one, large U.S. Government contractors and system integrators such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon Technologies, BAE Systems, and L3Harris, as well as Intelsat, Blue Halo, Microsoft, Amazon, Siemens, Rolls Royce, Boom, GE Aerospace and others.\nRevenue from the U.S. Government (which includes FMS) includes revenue from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. Revenues from U.S. Government agency customers in aggregate accounted for approximately 67%, 69% and 69% of total revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nBacklog\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), utilizing the modified retrospective method as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report. Since our adoption of ASC 606, revenues from remaining performance obligations, also referred to as total backlog, are now calculated as the dollar value of our remaining performance obligations on executed contracts. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our backlog was approximately $1,445.1 million and $1,243.9 million, respectively, of which $1,090.1 million was funded in 2024 and $944.6 million was funded in 2023. Backlog as of December 29, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 has increased primarily as a result of contract awards in our Space and Satellite, Microwave Products, C5ISR, Defense and Rocket Support and Unmanned Systems businesses. We expect to recognize approximately 57.0% of the remaining total backlog as revenue in 2025, an additional 17.0% in 2026 and the balance thereafter. \nTotal backlog is our estimate of the amount of revenue expected to be realized over the remaining life of awarded contracts and task orders that we have in hand as of the measurement date. Total backlog can include award fees, incentive fees, or other variable consideration estimated based on the most likely amount the Company is expected to be entitled to receive, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Total backlog can include both funded and unfunded future revenue under government contracts. Total backlog does not include orders for which neither party has performed and which each party has the unilateral right to terminate a wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party. As such, total backlog generally does not include options for additional performance obligations which have not been executed unless they are considered a material right of the base contract. For IDIQ contracts, only awarded or funded task orders are included for backlog purposes.\nWe define funded backlog as estimated future revenue under government contracts and task orders for which funding has been appropriated by Congress and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency, plus an estimate of the future revenue expected to be realized from commercial contracts that are under firm orders. Funded backlog does not include the full potential value of the Company’s contracts because Congress often appropriates funds to be used by an agency for a particular program of a contract on a yearly or quarterly basis even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. As a result, contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until Congress makes subsequent appropriation and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.\nContracts undertaken by us may extend beyond one year. Accordingly, portions are carried forward from one year to the next as part of backlog. Because many factors affect the scheduling of projects, no assurance can be given as to when revenue will be realized on projects included in our backlog. Although funded backlog represents only business that is considered to be firm, we cannot guarantee that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur. The majority of funded backlog represents contracts with terms that would entitle us to all or a portion of our costs incurred and potential fees upon cancellation by the customer.\nA significant number of the programs that Kratos’ systems, products and solutions support are multi-year/multi-decade in nature. Accordingly, based on historical customer usage or operational tempo, the Company has reasonable expectations or visibility of what ultimate orders for Kratos’ systems, products and solutions will be. The Company does not include these expected amounts in its backlog until a related contract award is received.\nManagement believes that year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future revenues. The actual timing of receipt of revenues, if any, on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects. In addition, cancellations or adjustments to contracts may occur. Backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded. Additionally, all U.S. Government contracts included in backlog, whether or not funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. Government.\nCybersecurity Program\nIn the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and certain sensitive information of the Company and third parties, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party information and employee information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, encryption of critical data, and security assessment of vendors. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and test our disaster recovery plan and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing and engage cybersecurity consultants to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. A cybersecurity consultant conducts regular network security reviews, scans and audits. In addition, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.\nOur cybersecurity program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies and practices designed to protect the privacy and security of our sensitive information and sensitive information of third parties with whom we do business. Our cybersecurity team reports to the full Board of Directors typically on an annual basis on information security and cybersecurity matters, or more frequently as needed. Certain members from our Board of Directors have cybersecurity experience. See “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” below for additional information.\nDespite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology or other systems could have significant consequences to our business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had a work force of approximately 4,000 full-time, part-time and on-call employees in approximately 14 countries. Our employees are our greatest asset, and the ability to recruit, retain, fairly compensate, and develop our workforce is critical to Kratos’ success.\nWe work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with local job networks and educational institutions to proactively attract a diverse pool of talent. We also strive to provide a compensation and benefits package that will attract, retain, and motivate employees and reward their performance, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. We are committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees, utilizing both external and internal benchmarking tools to do so. Eligible employees in the U.S. also have access to a wide range of benefits including medical, dental, and vision plans; life insurance, disability insurance and identity theft insurance; savings and retirement plans; an employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements and market practices.\nWe are also committed to employee development. The Company maintains talent and succession planning processes, including annual reviews and regular touchpoint reviews throughout the year, and periodic succession review of executive management by the Company’s chief executive officer and board of directors. We also provide training opportunities for employees at all levels, including live and online training, on the job training, and tuition reimbursement for formal continuing education. Our training program also includes compliance training to regularly promote and reinforce the Company’s culture of ethics and integrity in business.\nGuided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work.\nCompetition\nOur market is competitive and includes a number of companies in the U.S. defense, National Security, venture capital and private equity financed and commercial markets and industries. Most of the companies that we compete against have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and generate greater revenues than we do. Competition in the KGS and US segments include tier one, large U.S. Government contractors, newer defense technology companies including Anduril, XBow, Shield AI, Castellion, Ursa Major, Bee Hive, and others, and system integrators such as Northrop \nGrumman, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon Technologies, BAE Systems, L3Harris, General Atomics, and Boeing. While we view these and other government contractors and companies in our industry as competitors, we also routinely team or partner with these same companies in joint proposals or in the delivery of our products, solutions and services for customers. In fact, many of our tier one competitors are also our partners and our customers. Tier two competitors include smaller government contractors such as Mercury Systems, Qinetiq, Cobham, CACI, Peraton, Linquest (now owned by KBR), Viasat and AAR Corp. Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of business within the defense industry. It is also common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor or subcontractor on an award may, upon final award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the final prime contractor. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or be a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not frequently found in other industries.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our ability to win new business include our ability as a technology company to address the defense, national security and commercial markets, our belief that affordability is a technology, our focus on making internally funded investments, our ability to rapidly develop and produce actual working products and systems, our ability to manufacture military qualified and specified hardware and our strategy of being first to market with relevant systems, products and technology, focused on priority DoD requirements and funding areas. We also believe that our relationships with the traditional defense industry aerospace and defense system integrators, and the value we bring to them in partnership to pursue large new program opportunities, is a key differentiator for our Company. Also important is our reputation, past performance qualifications, customer relationships, domain and technology expertise, the ability to obtain and replace contract vehicles, the ability to deliver results within budget (time and cost), reputation, accountability, staffing flexibility, and project management expertise. Additionally, our ability to deliver cost effective systems, products, solutions and services that meet our customers’ and partners’ requirements is also a key differentiator.\nIn the U.S. defense, IT, and services markets, the U.S. Government has stressed competition and affordability or low cost in connection with its future procurement of products and services, i.e. affordable mass. This has led to fewer sole source awards, as well as more emphasis on cost competitiveness, with certain contract awards issued on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (“LPTA”) basis, rather than a best value basis, which has historically negatively impacted certain areas of our Defense and Rocket Support Systems (“DRSS”) business in our KGS segment and in our training services business. In addition, competitor bid protests have become more prevalent in the current competitive environment, resulting in further delay of contract procurement activity. As a result of these changing market dynamics, Kratos has made the strategic decision to deemphasize these types of potential LPTA services businesses, and to focus our financial and other resources on our products, systems, software and technology focused business areas, making internally funded investments in our related core competency and market focus business areas, developing and owning important intellectual property and being first to market with our offerings.\nResearch and Development\n    We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to rapidly develop new products and services, and enhancements to and applications for our existing products and services, to be delivered at an affordable cost. Our research and development expenses were $40.3 million, $38.4 million and $38.6 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth, which will focus on investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Our current primary internal research and development (“IR&D”) focus areas include satellite communications and signal monitoring, unmanned systems, electronic products, turbine technologies, rocket, hypersonic and other systems.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the intellectual skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. \nAs of December 29, 2024, we held a number of U.S. and foreign patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent, and we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right. We will continue to file and pursue patent applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. \nWe own or have rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Certain of our trademarks have also been registered in selected foreign countries.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to various government regulations, including various U.S. Government regulations as a contractor and subcontractor to the agencies of the U.S. Government. Among the most significant U.S. Government regulations affecting our business are:\n•the Federal Acquisition Regulations and supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance under government contracts;\n•the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Statute (formerly the Truth in Negotiations Act), which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n•the Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under cost-based government contracts;\n•the Industrial Security Manual, which establishes the security guidelines for classified programs and facilities as well as individual security clearances; \n•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from providing anything of value to a foreign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantages;\n•the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which, respectively, impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false facts provided to the government and impose penalties on the basis of false statements, even if they do not result in a payment; and\n•laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for National Security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nWe also need special security clearances to continue working on and advancing certain of our programs and contracts with the U.S. Government. Classified programs generally will require that we comply with various Executive Orders, federal laws and regulations and customer security requirements that may include restrictions on how we develop, store, protect and share information, and may require our employees to obtain government clearances.\nIn addition, we are subject to industry-specific regulations due to the nature of the products and services we provide. For example, certain aspects of our business are subject to further regulation by additional U.S. government authorities, including (i) the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates airspace for all air vehicles in the U.S. National Airspace System, (ii) the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate the wireless communications upon which our UAS business depend in the United States and (iii) the Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State that administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which regulate the export of controlled technical data, defense articles and defense services.\nThe nature of the work we do for the federal government may also limit the parties who may invest in or acquire us. Export laws may keep us from providing potential foreign acquirers with a review of the technical data they would be acquiring. In addition, there are special requirements for foreign parties who wish to buy or acquire control or influence over companies that control technology or produce goods in the security interests of the U.S. There may need to be a review under the Exon-Florio provisions of the Defense Production Act. including review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA). Finally, the government may require a prospective foreign owner to establish intermediaries to actually run that part of the company that does classified work, and establishing a subsidiary and its separate operation may make such an acquisition less appealing to such potential acquirers.\nIn addition, the export from the U.S. of certain of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act, and its implementing regulations as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Some of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing regulations, which licenses are generally harder to obtain and take longer to obtain than do Export Administration Act licenses.\nOur business may require compliance with state or local laws designed to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies.\nMaterial Availability\nWe procure critical material, components, products and subsystems from domestic and global supply partners. These supply sources may be single sources for certain components and the material provided may have extended lead times. To support our continuing customer needs, we have taken steps to mitigate sourcing risks. This includes working closely with our suppliers to ensure future material and subsystem availability to support our manufacturing plans. In some cases, we have elected to stock reserve material to ensure future availability.\nCertain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs are periodically subject to supply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and a global shortage of semiconductors, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers’ continued production of key components for our products, and the supply for certain subcomponents and parts is impacting our C5ISR business, and the shortage of qualified vendors which supply certain ancillary parts for our aerial targets have resulted in cost increases. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.\nEnvironmental\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws and regulations. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants in the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. U.S. laws also allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the U.S., the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. \nOther environmental laws, primarily in the U.S., address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean-up of such contamination. These laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on-going business, but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator. In addition, if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance, such as through its historic use as a disposal site, any person or company that has contributed to that contamination, whether or not it has a legal interest in the land, may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel.\nWe have management programs and processes in place that are intended to achieve compliance with, and minimize the potential for violations of, applicable environmental laws and regulations. \nAvailable Information\nWe file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

      "text": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained herein as well as the information included in this Annual Report and other reports and filings made with the SEC in evaluating our business and prospects. Risks and uncertainties, in addition to those we describe below, that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed and the price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes.\nRisk Factors Summary \nRisks Related to our Business\n•The U.S. Government provides a significant portion of our revenue, and our business could be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and other governmental entities.\n•Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. Government funding more broadly may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•If we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government agencies and prime contractors, our ability to successfully maintain and develop new business may be adversely affected.\n•The loss of one or more of our largest customers, programs, or applications could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects. Early termination of client contracts or contract penalties could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance and reputation as a contractor and our ability to obtain future business could suffer.\n•We face intense competition from many competitors that have greater resources than we do, which could result in price reductions, reduced profitability or loss of market share.\n•If the UAS and UGS markets do not experience significant growth, if we cannot expand our customer base or if our products do not achieve broad acceptance, or if the products we have developed or will develop do not become programs of record, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth.\n•Loss of our General Services Administration (“GSA”) contracts or government-wide acquisition contracts could impair our ability to attract new business.\n•Government contracts differ materially from standard commercial contracts, involve competitive bidding and may be subject to cancellation or delay without penalty.\n•We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\n•A preference for minority-owned, small and small disadvantaged businesses could impact our ability to be a prime contractor and limit our opportunity to work as a subcontractor on certain governmental procurements.\n•U.S. Government in-sourcing could result in loss of business opportunities and personnel.\n•Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\n•Our products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\n•Due to the volatile and flammable nature of certain components of our products and equipment, fires or explosions may disrupt our business or cause significant injuries, which could adversely affect our financial results.\n•Our margins and operating results may suffer if we experience unfavorable changes in the proportion of cost-plus-fee or fixed-price contracts in our total contract mix.\n•We have incurred and may continue to incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities, which could harm our profitability.\n•Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. We may be required to record valuation allowances on our net operating loss carryforwards in future periods, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Operations\n•Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies.\n•We may need additional capital to fund the growth of our business, and financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\n•Our cash may be subject to a risk of loss and we may be exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates.\n•Past acquisitions and future acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and strain our resources.\n•The loss of any member of our senior management could impair our relationships with U.S. Government customers and disrupt the management of our business.\n•If we fail to attract and retain skilled employees or employees with the necessary National Security clearances, we might not be able to perform under our contracts or win new business.\n•We are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government.\n•We are subject to DoD CMMC requirements issued by the Pentagon which may limit our ability to bid and win projects. The cost for the DoD CMMC requirements may be significant.\n•Cybersecurity breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could negatively impact our operations. \nRisks Related to our International Operations\n•Revenues derived from our international business could be subject to global economic downturn and hardship. \n•Our international business exposes us to additional risks.\n•Changes in foreign tax laws and regulations could expose us to additional tax liabilities and could adversely affect our financial risks.\nRisks Related to our Long-Term Borrowings\n•We have substantial long-term borrowings, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and business.\n•We and our subsidiaries may incur more debt, which may increase the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\n•A portion of our business is conducted through foreign subsidiaries, and the failure to generate sufficient cash flow from these subsidiaries, or otherwise repatriate or receive cash from these subsidiaries, could result in our inability to repay our indebtedness.\n•The agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us and our subsidiaries from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n•We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\n•Disclosure of trade secrets could cause harm to our business.\n•We may be harmed by intellectual property infringement claims.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Issues\n•Our failure to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business and subject us to a variety of penalties.\n•Our contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. Government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\n•We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities. This may affect our ability to develop, sell or rent our property or to borrow money where such property is required to be used as collateral.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n•Some of our contracts with the U.S. Government are classified, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe U.S. Government provides a significant portion of our revenue, and our business could be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and other governmental entities.\n    In fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we generated 67%, 69% and 69%, respectively, of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government (including all branches of the U.S. military and FMS), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. See the Industry Update section in Item 1 “Business” contained within this Annual Report for a discussion of the current budgetary and funding constraints on U.S. Government spending and legislation enacted to reduce the U.S. federal deficit. As a result, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience reduced or delayed awards on some of our programs, with a related negative impact to our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Competitor bid protests also have become more prevalent in the current competitive environment, which has led to further contract award delays. In addition, any future changes to the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government and foreign governmental entities may decrease overall government funding for defense and homeland security, result in delays in the procurement of our products and services due to lack of funding, cause the U.S. Government and government agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts, or cause them to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at-will or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Furthermore, on January 20, 2025, President Trump announced an executive order establishing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to maximize government efficiency and productivity. In February 2025, President Trump stated that he has directed DOGE to review Pentagon spending for potential waste and fraud. Pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government’s budget and potential changes in budgetary priorities, could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. Government funding more broadly may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n    U.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by Congress and the President or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions, as applicable. Laws and plans adopted by the U.S. Government relating to, along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the federal budget, potential changes in priorities and defense spending levels, sequestration, the appropriations process, use of continuing resolutions (with restrictions, e.g., on new starts) and the permissible federal debt limit, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. In the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, or planned orders are reduced, our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government or the prime contractor.\n    The federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, which could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and our programs in particular. \n    The budget environment, including budget caps mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”) for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, which was reinstituted with established budget caps for 2024 and 2025 under The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling and the appropriations process, remain significant short and long-term risks for the Company. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the current administration and Congress, what challenges budget reductions (required by the BCA and otherwise) will present for the defense industry and whether annual appropriations bills for all agencies will be enacted in a timely manner. If annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted, the U.S. Government may again operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets, and we may face additional government shutdowns of unknown duration. If a prolonged government shutdown of the DoD were to occur, it could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the U.S. Government’s ability to effectively progress programs and to make timely payments, and our ability to perform on our U.S. Government contracts and successfully compete for new work.\nWe believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country, the defense industrial base, including the Company, and the customers, employees, suppliers, investors, and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. It is likely budget and program decisions made in this environment will have long-term implications for us and the entire defense industry.\n    Additionally, funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed or cancelled, and budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers, and our employee base. While we believe that our business is well-positioned in areas that the DoD and other customers have indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending, the long-term impact of the BCA, other defense spending cuts, challenges in the appropriations process, the debt ceiling and the ongoing fiscal debates remain uncertain.\n    Significant delays or reductions in appropriations; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government agencies and prime contractors, our ability to successfully maintain and develop new business may be adversely affected.\nOur reputation and relationship with the U.S. Government, and in particular with the agencies of the DoD and the U.S. intelligence community, are key factors in maintaining and developing new business opportunities. In addition, we often act as a subcontractor or in “teaming” arrangements in which we and other contractors bid together on particular contracts or programs for the U.S. Government or government agencies. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other prime contractors for a portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Negative press reports regarding conflicts of interest, poor contract performance, employee misconduct, information security breaches or other aspects of our business, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. Additionally, as a subcontractor or team member, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation, even when we perform as required. As a result, we may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government agencies or prime contractors, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing business and compete successfully for new business.\nThe loss of one or more of our largest customers, programs, or applications could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of customers for certain large programs that represent a large portion of our revenues. A significant decrease in the sales to or loss of any of these programs or our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the U.S. Air Force accounted for 15.2% and 22.6% respectively, of our total revenues and the U.S. Navy accounted for 14.7% and 13.0%, respectively, of our total revenues. No assurance can be given that our customers will not experience financial, technical or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations. We believe that the USAF BQM-167, USN BQM-177, GBSD (also known as Sentinel) and the recently awarded MACH-TB 2.0 programs could represent a large portion of our future revenues in the coming years, and the loss or cancellation of any of these programs could adversely affect our future results. Further, new programs may yield lower margins than legacy programs, which could result in an overall reduction in gross margins.\nMany of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects. Early termination of client contracts or contract penalties could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe design, develop, and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and intellectual property rights, labor, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting requirements. Either we or the customer may generally terminate a contract as a result of a material uncured breach by the other. If we breach a contract or fail to perform in accordance with contractual service levels, delivery schedules, performance specifications, or other contractual requirements set forth therein, the other party thereto may terminate such contract for default, and we may be required to refund money previously paid to us by the customer or to pay penalties or other damages. Even if we have not breached, we may deal with various situations from time to time that may result in the amendment or termination of a contract. These steps can result in significant current period charges and/or reductions in current or future revenue, and/or delays in collection of outstanding receivables and costs incurred on the contract. Other factors that may affect revenue and profitability include inaccurate cost \nestimates, design issues, unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, and loss of follow-on work.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance and reputation as a contractor and our ability to obtain future business could suffer.\nAs a prime contractor, we often rely upon other companies as subcontractors to perform work we are obligated to perform for our customers. As we secure more work under certain of our contracts, we expect to require an increasing level of support from subcontractors that provide complementary and supplementary services to our offerings. We are responsible for the work performed by our subcontractors, even though in some cases we have limited involvement in that work. If one or more of our subcontractors fails to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis or violates U.S. Government contracting policies, laws or regulations, our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor or meet our customers’ expectations may be compromised. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability, including liability for the agency’s costs of re-procurement, could damage our reputation and could hurt our ability to compete for future contracts.\nWe are also required to procure certain materials and parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. The inability of a supplier to meet our needs or U.S. Government requirements or the appearance of counterfeit parts in our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and product availability.\nWe rely on other companies to provide major components for our products. For instance, we build the airframe, electronics and flight control systems for our unmanned aerial systems. We primarily rely on our suppliers to provide the engines and parachutes for landing the unmanned aerial systems. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. In addition, due to the shortage of qualified subcontractors and suppliers, increases in the cost of certain materials could impact our profitability under firm fixed priced contracts that we have with our customers.\nOur ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract. Changes in economic conditions, including changes in defense budgets or credit availability, or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier (including changes in ownership or operations) could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers and/or their ability to perform. The inability of our suppliers to perform, or their inability to perform adequately, could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers.\nIn connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer. We are also facing increased and changing regulatory requirements, many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers. In some cases, there may be only one supplier for certain components. If a sole source supplier cannot meet our needs or is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative.\nOur procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. We rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them; in some circumstances, we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance. We also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to effectively mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products and components they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers.\nIn addition, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs are periodically subject to supply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and a global shortage of semiconductors, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers’ continued production of key components for our products, and the supply for certain raw materials such as aluminum and resins, and the availability of certain parts and extrusions, and the availability for milling activities has, in each case, continued to experience shortages and delays which is impacting our C5ISR business. If we are unable to procure, or experience significant delays in subcontractor or supplier \ndeliveries of, needed materials, components, intellectual property or parts; if our subcontractors or suppliers do not comply with all applicable laws and regulations; if the certifications we receive from them are inaccurate; or if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe face intense competition from many competitors that have greater resources than we do, which could result in price reductions, reduced profitability or loss of market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts from many other firms, including mid-tier federal contractors with specialized capabilities, large defense contractors and IT service providers. Competition in our markets may increase as a result of a number of factors, such as the entrance of new or larger competitors, including those formed through alliances or consolidation, or the reduction in the overall number of government contracts. We may also face competition from prime contractors for whom we currently serve as subcontractors or teammates if those prime contractors choose to offer customer services of the type that we are currently providing. In addition, we may face competition from our subcontractors who, from time-to-time, seek to obtain prime contractor status on contracts for which they currently serve as a subcontractor to us.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources, larger customer bases and greater brand or name recognition than we do. Such competitors may be able to utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale to, among other things:\n•divert sales from us by winning very large scale government contracts, a risk that is enhanced by the recent trend in government procurement practices to bundle services into larger contracts and the recent trend of making award determinations on a LPTA basis;\n•divert sales from us by the award of government contracts to our competitors who may be willing to bid at substantially lower prices; \n•force us to charge lower prices; or\n•adversely affect our relationships with current customers, including our ability to continue to win competitively awarded engagements in which we are the incumbent.\nIn the event that the market for products in our US segment expands, we expect that competition will intensify as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing with larger, well-financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, larger diversified competitors serving as prime contractors may be able to supply underlying products and services from affiliated entities, which would prevent us from competing for subcontracting opportunities on these contracts. If we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower our prices, our revenue and operating profits could decline.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes.\nThe market for our services is characterized by rapid change and technological improvements. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments would result in serious harm to our business and operating results. We have derived, and we expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from providing innovative engineering services and technical solutions that are based upon today’s leading technologies and that are capable of adapting to future technologies. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market service offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our customers, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences.\nWe believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest significant financial resources to develop new offerings and technologies or to adapt or modify our existing offerings and technologies, including through IR&D, acquisitions and joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. These expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new markets. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may, in the future, experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our products will develop or continue to expand or that we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technology to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products.\nAdditionally, the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new product development efforts or if our products or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly as compared to our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the UAS and UGS markets do not experience significant growth, if we cannot expand our customer base or if our products do not achieve broad acceptance, or if the products we have developed or will develop do not become programs of record, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024, our US segment accounted for 23.8% of our total revenue. We cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or size of this market. Demand for our products may not increase, or may decrease, either generally or in specific markets, for particular types of products or during particular time periods. There are only a limited number of programs under which the U.S. military, our primary customer, is currently funding the development or purchase of our UAS and UGS products. Although we are seeking to expand our US customer base to include foreign governments, domestic non-military agencies and commercial customers, we cannot assure that our efforts will be successful. The expansion of the UAS and UGS markets in general, and the market for our products in particular, depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n•customer satisfaction with these types of systems as solutions;\n•the cost, performance and reliability of our products and products offered by our competitors;\n•customer perceptions regarding the effectiveness and value of these types of systems;\n•limitations on our ability to market our US products and services outside the U.S. due to U.S. \n    Government regulations or other restrictions; and\n•marketing efforts and publicity regarding these types of systems.\nEven if UAS and UGS gain wide market acceptance in general, our specific products may not adequately address market requirements or may not gain market acceptance. If these types of systems generally, or our products specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance, or if the products we have developed or will develop do not become programs of record, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nLoss of our GSA contracts or GWACs could impair our ability to attract new business.\nWe are a prime contractor under several GSA contracts and government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs). We believe that our ability to provide services under these contracts will continue to be important to our business because of the multiple opportunities for new engagements each contract provides. If we were to lose our position as prime contractor on one or more of these contracts, we could lose substantial revenues and our operating results could suffer. GSA contracts and other GWACs typically have a one or two-year initial term with multiple options exercisable at the government customer’s discretion to extend the contract for one or more years. We cannot be assured that our government customers will continue to exercise the options remaining on our current contracts, nor can we be assured that our future customers will exercise options on any contracts we may receive in the future.\nGovernment contracts differ materially from standard commercial contracts, involve competitive bidding and may be subject to cancellation or delay without penalty. \nGovernment contracts frequently include provisions that are not standard in private commercial transactions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the U.S. Government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the U.S. Government to:\n•terminate our existing contracts;\n•reduce potential future income from our existing contracts;\n•modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;\n•suspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the U.S. Government or with any specific government agency;\n•impose fines and penalties;\n•subject us to criminal prosecution;\n•suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related task orders if the necessary funds are not appropriated by Congress;\n•decline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiple year contract; and\n•claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nIn addition, government contracts are frequently awarded only after formal competitive bidding processes, which have been and may continue to be protracted and typically impose provisions that permit cancellation in the event that necessary funds are unavailable to the government agency. Competitive procurements impose substantial costs and managerial time and effort in order to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest certain contract awards through various agencies, administrative and judicial channels. We have experienced an increase in competitor bid protests on contracts on which we were the successful bidder due to the competitive environment resulting from decreased government spending. In addition, we have formally protested procurement awards in which we were not the initial successful bidder, but believed that the source selection process was flawed. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder’s contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. We may not be awarded contracts for which we bid, and substantial delays or cancellation of purchases may follow our successful bids as a result of such protests. We believe that this environment of protracted competitive bidding processes and competitor bid protests will continue.\nCertain of our government contracts also contain “organizational conflict of interest” clauses that could limit our ability to compete for certain related follow-on contracts. For example, when we work on the design of a particular solution, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that solution. While we actively monitor our contracts to avoid these conflicts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid all organizational conflict of interest issues.\nWe may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nBacklog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter and comparisons of backlog from period to period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues. The contracts comprising our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all, and the actual revenue from such contracts may differ from our backlog estimates. The timing of receipt of revenues, if any, on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects. Cancellation of or adjustments to contracts may occur. Additionally, all U.S. Government contracts included in backlog, whether or not funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. Government. The failure to realize all amounts in our backlog could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins. As a result, our funded, unfunded and total backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of our future earnings.\nA preference for minority-owned, small and small disadvantaged businesses could impact our ability to be a prime contractor and limit our opportunity to work as a subcontractor on certain governmental procurements.\nAs a result of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) set-aside program, the federal government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as minority-owned, small, or small disadvantaged businesses. We do not qualify as a minority-owned, small or small disadvantaged business. As a result, we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and in general would be restricted to no more than 49% of the work as a subcontractor on those programs. An increase in the amount of procurements under the SBA set-aside program, or other similar governmental programs, may impact our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor, limit our opportunity to work as a subcontractor or restrict our ability to compete on incumbent work that is placed in the set-aside program.\nU.S. Government in-sourcing could result in loss of business opportunities and personnel.\nThe U.S. Government has continued to reduce the percentage of contracted services in favor of more federal employees through an initiative called “in-sourcing.” Over time, in-sourcing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, as a result of in-sourcing, government procurements for services could be fewer and smaller in the future. In addition, work we currently perform could be in-sourced by the federal government and, as a result, our revenues could be reduced. Moreover, our employees could also be hired by the government. This loss of our employees would necessitate the need to retain and train new employees. Accordingly, the effect of in-sourcing or the continuation of in-sourcing at a faster-than-expected rate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks; insider threats; threats to the safety of our directors, officers and employees; threats to the security and viability of our facilities, infrastructure and supply chain; and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression. Our customers and partners (including our supply chain and joint ventures) face similar threats and growing \nrequirements. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. The occurrence of some of these risks may be increased to the extent remote working by our employees, suppliers, contractors and other third parties which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, continues. Such an incident could lead to losses or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or capabilities; theft or exposure of data; harm to personnel, infrastructure or products; regulatory actions; and/or financial liabilities, as well as potential damage to our reputation as a government contractor and provider of cyber-related or cyber-protected goods and services. \nCyber threats are continuously evolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems; unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (our Company's information or that of our employees, customers, partners, or other third parties); corruption of data, networks or systems; harm to individuals; and loss of assets. In addition, we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with or otherwise incorporated into our business. These events, if not prevented or effectively mitigated, could damage our reputation, require remedial actions and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, potential liability and other losses.\nWe provide systems, products and services to various customers (both government and commercial) who also face cyber threats. Our systems, products and services may themselves be subject to cyber threats and/or they may not be able to detect or properly deter threats, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. These losses could adversely affect our customers and our Company.\nThe impact of these various factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities, harm to individuals or property, damage to our reputation, loss of business, contractual or regulatory actions and potential liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIf we experience systems or service failure, our reputation could be harmed and our customers could assert claims against us for damages or refunds.\nWe create, implement and maintain IT solutions that are often critical to our customers’ operations. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, some systems and service failures, schedule or delivery delays and other problems in connection with our work. If we experience these problems, we may:\n•lose revenue due to adverse customer reaction;\n•be required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge;\n•cause customers to postpone, cancel or fail to renew contracts;\n•receive negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers; and\n•suffer claims for substantial damages.\nWe cannot ensure that provisions in our customer contracts will be legally sufficient to protect us if we are sued.\n In addition, our errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate, may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims may result in significant legal and other costs, be a distraction to our management and harm our reputation.\nOur products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur products, including but not limited to unmanned vehicles, aerial targets, UAS and ballistic missile targets, and hypersonic systems, are extremely complex and must operate successfully with complex products from other vendors. Despite testing, our products have contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects or errors, or experience performance problems when first introduced, when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our \nservice and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel’s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.\nThe existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products or the misuse of our products could also lead to lawsuits against us, result in injury, death, or property damage, and significantly damage our reputation and support for our products in general.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A successful liability claim could result in substantial cost to us. Even if we are fully insured as it relates to a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our brand and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDue to the volatile and flammable nature of certain components of our products and equipment, fires or explosions may\ndisrupt our business or cause significant injuries, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe development and manufacture of certain of our products involves the handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials as well as high power equipment. From time to time, these activities may result in incidents that could cause us to temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and/or fatalities. We have safety and loss prevention programs that require detailed reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. However, we cannot ensure that we will not experience such incidents in the future or that any such incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. In addition, our microwave electronics business, which is based in Israel, may suffer disruption or damage from acts of terrorism, or other conflicts in that geographic region.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe expect our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. Reductions in revenue in a particular quarter could lead to lower profitability in that quarter because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed in the short-term. We may incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and may not be able to recognize corresponding revenue in that same quarter. We may also incur additional expenses when contracts are terminated or expire or are not renewed.\nIn addition, payments due to us from our customers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures of government budgets to gain congressional and administration approval in a timely manner. The U.S. Government’s fiscal year ends September 30. If a federal budget for the next federal fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year, our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved. Any such suspensions may reduce our revenue in the fourth quarter of the federal fiscal year or the first quarter of the subsequent federal fiscal year. The U.S. Government’s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials. Any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year end would serve to increase our third or fourth quarter revenue, but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter, as these activities generally are not as profitable as our typical offerings.\nAdditional factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include those addressed elsewhere in this Item 1A “Risk Factors” and the following factors, among others:\n•the terms of customer contracts that affect the timing of revenue recognition;\n•variability in demand for our services and solutions;\n•commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n•timing of shipments and product deliveries;\n•timing of award or performance incentive fee notices;    \n•timing of significant bid and proposal costs;\n•the costs of remediating unknown defects, errors or performance problems of our product offerings;\n•variable purchasing patterns under GSA contracts, GWACs, blanket purchase agreements and other IDIQ contracts;\n•restrictions on and delays related to the export of defense articles and services;\n•costs related to government inquiries;\n•strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs and joint ventures;\n•strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n•the ability of certain of our commercial based customers to raise adequate capital to fund early stage commercial initiatives;\n•changes in the extent to which we use subcontractors;\n•seasonal fluctuations in our staff utilization rates;\n•changes in our effective tax rate, including changes in our judgment as to the necessity of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets; and\n•the length of sales cycles.\nSignificant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular quarter could cause us to fall out of compliance with the financial covenants related to our debt which, if not waived, could restrict our access to capital and cause us to take extreme measures to pay down the debt, if any, under our five-year $200 million Revolving Credit Facility and five-year $200 million Term Loan A entered into on February 18, 2022 (collectively, the “2022 Credit Facility”). In addition, fluctuations in our financial results could cause our stock price to decline. See the risks and uncertainties related to our ability to raise additional capital below in “We may need additional capital to fund the growth of our business, and financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.”\nOur margins and operating results may suffer if we experience unfavorable changes in the proportion of cost-plus-fee or fixed‑price contracts in our total contract mix.\nAlthough fixed-price contracts entail a greater risk of a reduced profit or financial loss on a contract compared to other types of contracts we enter into, fixed-price contracts typically provide higher profit opportunities because we may be able to benefit from cost savings and operating efficiencies. In contrast, cost-plus-fee contracts are subject to statutory limits on profit margins and generally are the least profitable of our contract types. Our U.S. Government customers typically determine what type of contract we enter into. Cost-plus-fee and fixed-price contracts in our federal business accounted for approximately 37% and 60%, respectively, of our federal business revenues for the year ended December 29, 2024. To the extent that we enter into more cost-plus-fee or less fixed-price contracts in proportion to our total contract mix in the future, our margins and operating results may suffer. Our operating results may also suffer to the extent we have a contract mix that is focused on developmental projects, which are typically at lower profit margins as compared to margins on production projects.\nCost overruns on our contracts could subject us to losses, decrease our operating margins and adversely affect our future business.\nFixed-price contracts (including both government and commercial contracts) represented approximately 69% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024. If we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during our performance of fixed-price contracts, then we may incur losses on these contracts because we absorb any costs in excess of the fixed price. In addition, under fixed-price contracts, we are required to absorb any unanticipated costs resulting from inflation, including increases in costs of materials and labor. Under cost-plus-fee contracts, if costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, then we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs. Under time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Because many of our contracts involve advanced designs and innovative technologies, we may experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control the costs we incur in performing under the contract, then our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.\nOur cash flow and profitability could be reduced if expenditures are incurred prior to the final receipt of a contract.\nWe provide various professional services, specialized products, and sometimes procure equipment and materials on behalf of our customers under various contractual arrangements. From time to time, in order to ensure that we satisfy our customers’ delivery requirements and schedules, we may elect to initiate procurement and production in advance of receiving a contract award, or final authorization from the government customer or a prime contractor. In addition, from time to time, we may build production units such as unmanned aerial vehicles in advance of receiving an anticipated contract award. In addition, to mitigate the impact of increasing material costs, we may procure larger lots of materials in advance to obtain larger quantity purchase discounted pricing. These actions that we may take to procure materials and/or commence production in advance of contract award require use of our working capital resources which impact our near-term operating cash flows. If our government or prime contractor customer’s requirements should change or if the government or the prime contractor should \ndirect the anticipated procurement to another contractor, or if the anticipated contract award does not materialize, or if the equipment or materials become obsolete or require modification before we are under contract for the procurement, our investment in the equipment or materials might be at risk if we cannot efficiently resell them. This could reduce anticipated earnings or result in a loss, negatively affecting our cash flow and profitability.\nIf we fail to respond to commercial industry cycles in terms of our cost structure, manufacturing capacity, and/or personnel needs, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe timing, length, and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the commercial and defense industries are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature of the industries in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue, and in some cases, future expense levels. During down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in orders but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair our ability to recognize revenue or to collect on outstanding receivables. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. We must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to reflect prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. If we fail to respond to fluctuating market conditions our business could be seriously harmed. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase engineering and manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. Each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face significant risks in the management of our inventory, and failure to effectively manage our inventory levels may result in product recalls or supply imbalances that could harm our business.\nWe maintain a variety of parts and components in inventory to allow us to customize our products for specific customer requirements, which parts are subject to obsolescence and expiration. Due to the long-lead time for obtaining certain product components and the manufacturing cycles, we need to make forecasts of demand and commit significant resources towards manufacturing our products. As such, we are subject to significant risks in managing the inventory needs of our business during the year, including estimating the appropriate demand for our products. In addition, as a result of recent disruptions in supply chain for certain materials and parts, we have been making advanced inventory purchases in an attempt to mitigate the impact of these disruptions, which has resulted in an increase in inventory levels and has required use of our working capital. Should orders and market conditions differ significantly from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In the future, we may be required to record write-downs of finished products and materials on-hand and/or additional charges for excess purchase commitments as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts or customer orders, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities, which could harm our profitability.\nAs of December 29, 2024, goodwill represented approximately 29% of our total assets. We test for impairment annually. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is deemed impaired. Accordingly, an impairment charge would be recognized for that reporting unit in the period identified.\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist, the two-step impairment process is then performed. For operations where the two-step process is used, the identification and measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment. Accounting for impairment contains uncertainty because management must make judgments in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions, among other things.\nGiven the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty in the U.S. defense industry, including sequestration and issues surrounding the national debt ceiling and inflationary impacts to certain of our businesses, our future revenues, profits and cash flows could be substantially lower than our current projections. Market conditions, including increased price competitiveness specifically in the government services space, and procurements awarded on an LPTA rather than a best value basis, can significantly impact our projections. In addition, our ability to penetrate new international markets could also impact our current projections. Additional market factors could impact our projections and our ability to successfully \ndevelop new products and platforms. For example, our US reporting unit forecasts include the successful completion of certain performance criteria on new unmanned systems platforms, and acceptance of new unmanned systems platforms on a technical basis as well as from a political and government budgetary standpoint, including the assumption that products we have developed or will develop will become programs of record. In addition, market-based inputs to the calculations in the impairment test, such as weighted average cost of capital, and market multiples, could also be negatively impacted. Such circumstances may result in the future deterioration of the fair value of our reporting units and an impairment of our goodwill. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. Any resulting impairment loss could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nFailure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims.\nOur engagements often involve large scale, highly complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our customers and to effectively manage the project and deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. Any defects or errors or failure to meet customers’ expectations could result in claims for substantial damages against us. Our contracts generally limit our liability for damages that arise from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering services to our customers. However, we cannot be sure that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued. In addition, in certain instances, we guarantee customers that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. If the project experiences a performance problem, we may not be able to recover the additional costs we will incur, which could exceed revenues realized from a project. Finally, if we underestimate the resources or time we need to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts, and any changes in such estimates could have an adverse effect on our profitability and our overall financial performance.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, complexity of the work to be performed, cost and availability of materials, impact of delayed performance and timing of product deliveries. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete a contract since costs also include expected increases in wages, prices for materials and allocated fixed costs. Similarly, assumptions are made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates.\nBecause of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts, future period financial reporting and performance.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. We may be required to record valuation allowances on our net operating loss carryforwards in future periods which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nFederal and state income tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards in the event that an “ownership change” occurs for tax purposes, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe we underwent an ownership change in March 2010 that limited the Company’s federal annual utilization of NOL carryforwards. If the entire limitation amount is not utilized in a year, the excess can be carried forward and utilized in future years. For the year ended December 29, 2024, there was no impact of such limitations on the income tax provision since the amount of taxable income did not exceed the cumulative annual limitation amount. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could also cause an “ownership change.” If and when any other “ownership change” occurs, utilization of the NOL or other tax attributes may be further limited.\nGiven the current market conditions and continued economic uncertainty in the U.S. defense industry and issues surrounding the national debt ceiling impacts to certain of our businesses, including disruptions in supply chain and inflationary \nimpacts, our future revenues, profits, cash flows, and taxable income could be substantially lower than our then-current projections. Market conditions, including increased price competitiveness specifically in the government services space, and procurements awarded on an LPTA rather than a best value basis, can significantly impact our projections. In addition, our ability to penetrate new international markets could also impact our current projections. Additional market factors could impact our projections and our ability to successfully develop new products and platforms. For example, our US reporting unit forecasts include the successful completion of certain performance criteria on new unmanned systems platforms, and acceptance of new unmanned systems platforms on a technical basis as well as from a political and government budgetary standpoint. In addition, reforms or changes to current tax regulations could impact the future utilization of our NOLs. Such circumstances may result in the expiration of our NOLs before we are able to utilize them, which could result in a requirement to record valuation allowances. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, a valuation allowance may be required in future periods.\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development costs and devote significant resources to identifying and developing new products and services, which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result in revenue to us.\nOur future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications, and introducing new products and services that achieve market acceptance. We plan to incur substantial research and development costs as part of our efforts to design, develop and commercialize new products and services and enhance existing products. We spent $40.3 million, or 3.5% of our total revenue, in our fiscal year ended December 29, 2024 on internally funded research and development activities. We believe that there are significant investment opportunities in a number of business areas. Because we account for research and development as an operating expense, these expenditures will adversely affect our earnings. Further, our research and development programs may not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial results and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies.\nA pandemic or other epidemic or public health emergency, poses the risk that we or our employees, suppliers and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation measures had an adverse impact on global economic conditions which had, and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The extent to which the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other outbreak of an epidemic disease, impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nPandemics, epidemics and other public health emergencies may have negative impacts on certain of our operations, including employee absenteeism, our supply chain, vendors, transportation networks and customers, which may reduce certain of our sales and our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, our suppliers, other businesses and governments have taken or may take. \nWe may need additional capital to fund the growth of our business, and financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe currently anticipate that our available capital resources, amounts available under our Credit Agreement (as defined below in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the heading “2022 Credit Facility”) and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, these resources may not be sufficient to fund the long-term growth of our business, especially in the event that we are awarded future multiple sizable production awards related to our tactical drone programs or in the event we are awarded future multiple sizable production awards related to our turbine technologies and rocket motor businesses, each of which will require significant amounts of working capital to fund such growth. If we determine that it is necessary to raise additional funds, either through an expansion or refinancing of our Credit Agreement or through public or private debt offerings or additional public or private equity financings, additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access these markets. Limitations on our ability to borrow contained in our Credit Agreement may limit our access to capital, and we could fall out of compliance with financial and other covenants contained in our Credit Agreement which, if not waived, \nwould restrict our access to capital and could require us to pay down any then-existing debt under the Credit Agreement. Our lenders may not agree to extend additional or continuing credit under our Credit Agreement or waive restrictions on our access to capital. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of available opportunities, develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur cash may be subject to a risk of loss and we may be exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio\ninvestments and in interest rates.\nOur assets include a significant amount of cash and investments. We adhere to an investment policy set by our board of directors which aims to preserve our financial assets, maintain adequate liquidity and maximize returns. We believe that our cash is held in institutions whose credit risk is minimal and that the value and liquidity of our deposits are accurately reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 29, 2024. We currently invest the majority of our cash in institutional U.S. money market funds, institutional U.S. treasury money market funds, U.S. treasuries, and U.S. government agency securities, in depository accounts with large financial institutions, and in depository accounts with large global financial institutions for those cash balances that are held by our foreign subsidiaries, the performance of which are subject to additional market risks related to their respective issuers and those global financial institutions. Nearly all of our cash and bank deposits are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Therefore, our cash and any bank deposits that we now hold or may acquire in the future may be subject to risks, including the risk of loss or of reduced value or liquidity. In the future, should we determine that there is a decline in value of any of our portfolio securities which is not temporary in nature, this would result in a loss being recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPast acquisitions and future acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and strain our resources.\nWe have in the past and may, in the future, acquire additional businesses that we believe could complement or expand our business or increase our customer base. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Integrating the operations of acquired businesses successfully or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, involves a number of potential challenges. The failure to meet these integration challenges could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. Realizing the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the integration of operations and personnel. These integration activities are complex and time-consuming, and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs, including:\n•our inability to achieve the operating synergies anticipated in the acquisitions;\n•diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters;\n•difficulties in consolidating and rationalizing IT platforms and administrative infrastructures;\n•complexities associated with managing the geographic separation of the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical locations where management may determine consolidation is desirable;\n•difficulties in integrating personnel from different corporate cultures while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service;\n•difficulties or delays in transitioning U.S. Government contracts pursuant to federal acquisition regulations;\n•challenges in demonstrating to customers of Kratos and to customers of acquired businesses that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus;\n•possible cash flow interruption or loss of revenue as a result of change of ownership transitional matters; and\n•inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nAcquired businesses may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition, including cyber and other security vulnerabilities. In particular, to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to the U.S. Government or other customers, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairment in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our stock. Acquisitions and/or the related equity financings could also impact our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in \nexcess of what we anticipate. Acquisitions frequently involve benefits related to integration of operations. The failure to successfully integrate the operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful.\nWe also evaluate from time to time the potential disposition of assets or business that may no longer meet our growth, return and/or strategic objectives. Divestitures have inherent risks, including the possibility that any anticipated sale will be delayed or will not occur, the potential failure to realize the perceived strategic or financial merits of the divestment, difficulties in the separation of operations, services, information technology, products and personnel, unexpected costs associated with such separation, diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and potential post-closing claims for alleged breaches of related agreements, indemnification or other disputes. A failure to successfully complete a disposition or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of a disposition could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business and financial results could suffer.\nSustaining our growth has placed significant demands on our management, as well as on our administrative, operational and financial resources. For us to continue to manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems and expand, motivate and manage our workforce. Additionally, our future financial results depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our growth on a combined basis with the businesses we have acquired and those we may acquire in the future. If we are unable to manage our growth while maintaining our quality of service and profit margins, or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing our growth do not produce the expected benefits, our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may need to invest in new information technology systems and infrastructure to scale our operations.\nWe may need to adopt new information technology systems and infrastructure to scale our business and obtain the synergies from prior and future acquisitions. Our information technology and business systems and infrastructure could create product development or production work stoppages, unnecessarily increase our inventory, negatively impact product delivery times and quality, and increase our compliance costs. Failure to invest in newer information technology and business systems and infrastructure may lead to operational inefficiencies and increased compliance costs and risks. In addition, an inability to maximize the utility and benefit of our current information technology and business tools could impact our ability to meet cost reduction and planned efficiency and operational improvement goals.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management could impair our relationships with U.S. Government customers and disrupt the management of our business.\nWe believe that the success of our business and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued contributions of the members of our senior management. We rely on our senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that many members of our senior management team have established and maintain with U.S. Government personnel contribute to our ability to maintain strong customer relationships and to identify new business opportunities. The loss of any member of our senior management could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts, to maintain good customer relations and to otherwise manage our business.\nIf we fail to attract and retain skilled employees or employees with the necessary National Security clearances, we might not be able to perform under our contracts or win new business.\nThe growth of our business and revenue depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly qualified individuals who have advanced technical and/or engineering skills. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain U.S. Government contracts require us, and some of our employees, to maintain National Security clearances. Obtaining and maintaining National Security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold National Security clearances. Further, some of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to staff an engagement with personnel that the customer considers key to our successful performance under the contract. In the event we are unable to provide these key personnel or acceptable substitutions, the customer may terminate the contract. As a result, if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may lose revenue and our ability to maintain and grow our business could be limited.\nMoreover, in a tight labor market our direct labor costs could increase or we may be required to engage large numbers of subcontractor personnel, which could cause our profit margins to suffer. Conversely, if we maintain or increase our staffing levels in anticipation of one or more projects and the projects are delayed, reduced or terminated, we may underutilize the additional personnel, which would increase our general and administrative expenses, reduce our earnings and possibly harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government.\nA facility security clearance is required for a company to perform on classified contracts for the DoD and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government. Security clearances are subject to regulations and requirements including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (“NISPOM”), which specifies the requirements for the protection of classified information released or disclosed in connection with classified U.S. Government contracts.\nWe require certain facility and personnel security clearances to perform our classified U.S. Government related business. As such, we must comply with the requirements of the NISPOM and any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations. If we were to violate the terms and requirements of the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations (which apply to us under the terms of classified contracts), any of our cleared facilities could lose its facility security clearance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our facility security clearances. If for some reason one or more of our facility security clearances is invalidated or terminated, we would not be able to continue to perform on classified contracts at that facility and would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could adversely affect our revenues. Failure to comply with the NISPOM or other security requirements may subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of access to classified information, loss of a U.S. Government contract, or potentially debarment as a government contractor.\nWe are subject to the DoD CMMC requirement issued by the Pentagon which may limit our ability to bid and win projects. The cost for the DoD CMMC requirement may be significant. \nThe Pentagon, on January 31, 2020, released the official version of its unified Cybersecurity standard that all contractors must meet by 2026. This standard, the CMMC, will apply to any company that does business with the DoD. CMMC will also apply to subcontractors as well as prime contractors. CMMC borrows heavily from the existing NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and intends to rely heavily on a CMMC accrediting body up and running, companies will be able to apply for certification through a portal run by the accrediting body. The CMMC certification will be good for three years; with it, companies will be able to bid on contracts across the DoD and military services. In December 2020, the DoD disclosed the first seven contracts that are likely to be the initial test cases for the first “pathfinder” solicitations mandating CMMC. It is expected to take until 2026 to bring all contractors into compliance, since five years is the typical duration of a government contract. Contractors are required to flow the CMMC requirements down to all subcontracts except those for Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) items. Additionally, a contractor may not award a subcontract unless the subcontractor has a current assessment in the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS). Because contractors only have access to their own information, contractors may need to rely on certifications from subcontractors for this requirement.\nAs initially envisioned under CMMC, there would be five levels of CMMC certification and contractors would no longer “self-attest” they meet a given standard. Instead, Pentagon approved third parties will assess each company, at the company’s expense. There will be no fines for non-compliance, however contractors will not be able to be awarded new contracts that require a particular level of certification without the required certification. \nUnder the CMMC 2.0 Model announced on July 17, 2021, there will be three levels of certification, Level 1 through Level 3, with contractors able to self-attest for Level 1. The new certification will not be required for existing contracts already signed, only on new contracts and potentially, to modification of existing contracts. CMMC 2.0 will allow for so-called plans of action and milestones, which will allow companies to document controls they are not fully implementing yet. The plans of action are required to state the means by which companies expect to reach full compliance, which are required to be completed within 180 days. Another change includes the requirement for senior company officials to self-certify and submit attestations of compliance. If there is a breach but a company certified its compliance with the security standards, a company could be open to False Claims Act lawsuits. The final change in the draft CMMC 2.0 requires cloud computing services used by the government contractor to be certified through the FedRAMP authorization process in accordance with DoD security requirements. Proposed final CMMC rules were issued by the DoD on December 26, 2023, with a public comment period that ended on February 26, 2024. The final rules were released October 15, 2024 and became effective on December 16, 2024, with audits expected to begin by January 2, 2025.\nWe may be unable to bid on new contract awards or on follow-on awards for existing work, depending on the level of standard as required for each solicitation, which could adversely impact our revenues, operating margins and cash flows. The cost to comply with the new CMMC requirement has been significant and may increase. Further, we may be negatively impacted by our subcontractors if they are not compliant with these requirements.\nCybersecurity breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could negatively impact our operations. \nWe utilize our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Some of these systems are managed by outside vendors. We use these systems to manage and support critical business activities as well as collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. These systems may be susceptible to security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks from hackers, criminals, malicious insiders, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties. Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents can be caused by human error from our workforce or that of our third-party service providers, by malicious third parties, acting alone or in groups, or by more sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and state-sponsored organizations. Such risks may be elevated in connection with geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war. Certain unauthorized parties may have in the past managed, and may in the future manage, to overcome our security measures and those of our third-party service providers to access and misuse systems and software by exploiting defects in design or manufacture, including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that unexpectedly compromise the security or operation of a product or system. Further, malicious third parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products, services or solutions to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics, and this risk is heightened in our current hybrid model working environment. Malicious actors may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our products, services and solutions, including unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service. While we actively combat such fraudulent activities, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, impacts to our revenue from such activities. Further, unauthorized parties may also gain physical access to our facilities and infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services or information systems to access content and data. The loss of or unauthorized access to data, such as resulting from computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware may harm our systems, expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation and subject us to costly and time-intensive notification requirements.\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\n    We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nRevenues derived from our international business could be subject to global economic downturn and hardship.\nOur international business represents 20% of our total revenue for the year ended December 29, 2024, which may be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and may be further impacted by global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Continued international economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in reductions in our revenue. \nAdditionally, disruptions in international credit markets may materially limit consumer credit availability and restrict credit availability of our customers. Any reduction in international sales of our solutions resulting from reductions in consumer spending or continued disruption in the availability of credit to retailers or consumers, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in foreign tax laws and regulations could expose us to additional tax liabilities and could adversely affect our financial results.\nSeveral countries around the world have enacted or proposed changes to their existing tax laws based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 project. As each country in which we operate evaluates their alignment with the recommendations and enacts their own tax rules, the ultimate impact of any such changes on our effective tax rate remains uncertain. However, any such changes to foreign tax laws could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks.\n    Our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-U.S. laws, regulations and customs, including those related to: \n•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, potentially reducing the U.S. dollars we receive for sales denominated in foreign currency or reducing our profits when we pay for materials, subcontractors and payroll denominated in foreign currency; \n•the possibility that unfriendly nations or groups could boycott our products or solutions; \n•political conditions in the markets in which we operate; \n•the escalation or continuation of armed conflict, hostilities or economic sanctions between countries or regions, including the current armed conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East;\n•potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures; \n•import-export control, including the imposition of tariffs, embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions;\n•the ability to obtain required U.S. Government agency issued export licenses to ship our product overseas;\n•more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; \n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; \n•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; \n•the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; \n•longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries, whether due to cultural differences, exchange rate fluctuation or other factors; \n•technology and data transfer restrictions; \n•changes to our distribution networks;\n•our employees; and\n•war and terrorist events, including impacts to our international operations such as our microwave electronics business which has primary operations based in Israel.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. In addition, due to the nature of our products, we must obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before selling our products outside of the U.S. Our ability to obtain these licenses and authorizations timely or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. Government policies or laws or delays in Congressional action due to geopolitical and other factors. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nViolations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) or other applicable trade compliance regulations could result in significant sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements and debarments from export \nprivileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of ITAR or other applicable trade regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Long-Term Borrowings\nWe have substantial long-term borrowings, which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and business.\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had approximately $174.6 million of long-term borrowings outstanding, which is net of $0.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. As a result of this indebtedness, our interest payment obligations are significant, and are subject to fluctuate as the interest rate is floating with SOFR (the “Secured Overnight Financing Rate”). The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n•it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n•it may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n•it may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;\n•it may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n•it may limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n•it may decrease our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur level of long-term borrowings increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt and to make the scheduled mandatory quarterly payments. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing capital expenditures, reducing internal investments in research and development efforts, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. These alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all, and they may not yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare certain outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable. If the amounts outstanding under any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur more debt, which may increase the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt permit us, under some circumstances, to incur certain additional indebtedness or obligations. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nChanges in our credit metrics or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nMacroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, and the current high levels of inflation and interest rates, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing at terms satisfactory to us, if at all, thereby affecting our resources to support operations or to fund new initiatives. In addition, if our credit metrics decline, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility.\nA portion of our business is conducted through foreign subsidiaries, and the failure to generate sufficient cash flow from these subsidiaries, or otherwise repatriate or receive cash from these subsidiaries, could result in our inability to repay our indebtedness.\nAs of December 29, 2024, approximately 11% of our consolidated assets, based on book value, and 13% of our total revenues for the year ended December 29, 2024, were attributable to foreign subsidiaries, which do not guarantee our indebtedness. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations with cash from foreign subsidiaries will depend upon the results \nof operations of these subsidiaries and may be subject to legal, contractual or other restrictions and other business considerations. In addition, dividend and interest payments to us from the foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, which would reduce the amount of funds we receive from such foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, to the extent that we must use cash generated in foreign jurisdictions to make principal or interest payments on our debt, there may be a cost associated with repatriating the cash to the U.S. Dividends and other distributions from our foreign subsidiaries may also be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and legal and other restrictions on repatriation, which could further reduce the amount of funds we receive from such foreign subsidiaries.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us and our subsidiaries from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur Credit Agreement subjects us, and our subsidiaries, to several financial and other restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens or indebtedness, payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, and mergers, sales or other dispositions of our assets.\nOur Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios, including a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which are required to be maintained until all amounts outstanding have been paid in full and all letters of credit have expired or have been terminated under the Credit Agreement. Many factors, including events beyond our control, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants and financial ratios. We cannot be sure we will meet our debt-related obligations or that lenders will waive any failure to meet those obligations. Any failure to meet those debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under our indebtedness and the acceleration of such indebtedness.\nThe restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in the Company’s interest.\nThe discontinuance of LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations.\nInterest rates under our Credit Agreement are based partly on Term SOFR. Interest rates under any other loan or commercial agreements may be based partly on LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, which is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The FCA and LIBOR’s administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, have since announced that most LIBOR settings will no longer be published after the end of 2021 but that the most widely used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (i.e., rates for the calculation of one, three and six month LIBOR) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available, or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates under agreements that utilize LIBOR. Further, we may need to renegotiate any agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative variable rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract. \nOur usage of Term SOFR and other metrics based on SOFR in our Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our indebtedness may expose us to additional risks due to SOFR’s limited market history and our limited experience using SOFR as a reference rate. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate, as the publication of SOFR began in April 2019. The future performance of Term SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as USD- LIBOR. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our indebtedness is difficult to predict. Furthermore, we and other market participants have less experience understanding and modeling SOFR-based assets and liabilities than LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, increasing the difficulty of investing, hedging, and risk management.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. \nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will remain valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing on our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.\nDisclosure of trade secrets could cause harm to our business. \nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with third parties, our employees and consultants. However, these agreements can be breached and, if they are, there may not be an adequate remedy available to us. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could market services or products similar to our services and products, which could reduce demand for our offerings. Any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, with no assurance of success.\nWe may be harmed by intellectual property infringement claims.\nWe may become subject to claims from our employees or third parties who assert that software and other forms of intellectual property that we use in delivering services and solutions to our customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties. Our employees develop some of the software and other forms of intellectual property that we use to provide our services and solutions to our customers, but we also license technology from other vendors. If our employees, vendors, or other third parties assert claims that we or our customers are infringing on their intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial costs to defend those claims. If any such infringement claims were ultimately successful, we could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology, obtain a license or additional licenses from our employees, vendors, or other third parties, or redesign our products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Issues\nOur failure to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business and subject us to a variety of penalties.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers, prime contractors, subcontractors and vendors and may impose added costs on us. New regulations or procurement requirements (including, for example, regulations regarding counterfeit and corrupt parts, supply chain diligence and cybersecurity) or changes to current requirements could increase our costs and risk of non-compliance. Our role as a contractor to agencies and departments of the U.S. Government results in our being routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations, including those associated with organizational conflicts of interest, procurement integrity, bid integrity and claim presentation, among others. These investigations may be conducted without our knowledge. Adverse findings in these investigations or reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and we could face civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation and competitive position if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true. If our reputation or relationship with U.S. Government agencies were impaired, or if the U.S. Government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our revenue and operating profit would decline.\nOur contracts and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. Government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors’ administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They may also review the adequacy of our compliance with government standards for our accounting and management of internal control systems, including our control environment and overall accounting system; general IT system; budget and planning system; purchasing system; material management and accounting system; compensation system; labor system; indirect and other direct costs system; billing system; and estimating system used for pricing on government contracts. Both contractors and the U.S. Government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. Recent audits and reviews have become more rigorous, and the standards to which contractors are being held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. \nA finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our U.S. Government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our corrections are accepted by Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”). Government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an “approved” determination of our various accounting and management internal control systems, including changes to our indirect cost and direct labor estimating systems, from the responsible U.S. Government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. A determination of non-compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. Government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. Government.\nWe have submitted incurred cost claims through fiscal year 2023. The Government has provided fiscal year 2023 final rate agreement letters for certain Kratos entities and is currently auditing the fiscal year 2023 incurred cost claims of one Kratos entity. Although we have recorded contract revenues based upon costs that we believe will be approved upon final completion of the audits, we do not know what the results of any current or future government audits, for fiscal year 2023 incurred costs, will be. If future adjustments were to exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur employees or others acting on our behalf may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could cause us to lose contracts or cause us to incur costs.\nWe are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct from our employees or others acting on our behalf could occur. Misconduct by employees or others could include intentional failures to comply with U.S. Government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, insider threats to our cybersecurity, or falsifying time records. Misconduct by our employees or others acting on our behalf could also involve the improper use of our customers’ sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us, serious harm to our reputation, a loss of contracts and a reduction in revenues, or cause us to incur costs to respond to any related governmental inquiries. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could cause us to lose contracts or cause a reduction in revenues. In addition, alleged or actual misconduct by employees or others acting on our behalf could result in investigations or prosecutions of persons engaged in the subject activities, which could result in unanticipated consequences or expenses and management distraction for us regardless of whether we are alleged to have any responsibility.\n    We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct, despite our various compliance programs. Misconduct or improper actions by our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners and/or joint ventures could subject us to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions; monetary and non-monetary penalties; liabilities; and the loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension and debarment, which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities. This may affect our ability to develop, sell or rent our property or to borrow money where such property is required to be used as collateral.\nWe use hazardous materials common to the industries in which we operate. We are required to follow federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling, storage and disposal of these materials, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and the Toxic Substances Control Act. We could be subject to fines, suspensions of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or interruption or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future laws or regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. These regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur significant other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the handling, use, storage or disposal of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to liabilities and production delays, which could cause us to miss our customers’ delivery schedules, thereby reducing our sales for a given period. We may also have to pay regulatory fines, penalties or other costs (including remediation costs), which could materially reduce our profits and adversely affect our financial condition. Permits are required for our operations, and these permits are subject to renewal, modification and, in some cases, revocation.\nIn addition, under environmental laws, ordinances or regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of some kinds of petroleum products or other hazardous substances on, under, or in its property, adjacent or nearby property, or offsite disposal locations, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. We have incurred, and may incur in the future, liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental laws at our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby properties or offsite disposal locations. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, hazardous substances may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral. Additionally, we may become subject to claims by third parties based on damages, including personal injury and property damage, and costs resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nThe increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results. \nThere has been increasing focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on a variety of environmental, social and other sustainability matters. We may experience pressure to make commitments relating to sustainability matters that affect us, including the design and implementation of specific risk mitigation strategic initiatives relating to sustainability. If we are not effective in addressing environmental, social and other sustainability matters affecting our business, or setting and meeting relevant sustainability goals, our reputation and financial results may suffer. In addition, we may experience increased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and measure achievement of those goals, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, this emphasis on environmental, social and other sustainability matters has resulted and may result in the adoption of new laws and regulations, including new reporting requirements. Recently, California legislation was enacted that will require climate-related risk disclosures for companies doing business in the state. These will be effective for Kratos beginning in 2026. If we fail to comply with new laws, regulations or reporting requirements, our reputation and business could be adversely impacted. \nRegulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. \nWe are subject to regulations requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rule requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries. The rule can affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals is limited. In addition, there are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we are not always able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through \nthe due diligence procedures we implemented, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nNatural disasters or severe weather conditions could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or higher expenses.\nOur business depends on maintaining operations at our facilities and being able to operate at our customer facilities and project locations. A serious, prolonged interruption or damage due to power outage, telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. While we insure against certain business interruption risks, such insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSome of our contracts with the U.S. Government are classified, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. Government that are subject to security restrictions (classified programs) that preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for National Security purposes. We are limited in our ability to provide details about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors and others might have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and, therefore, less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends or buyback any Kratos stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared any cash dividends since becoming a public company. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth and development of the business and, therefore, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. We also do not expect to buy back any of our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends and buyback Kratos stock is restricted by our Credit Agreement. Any determination to pay dividends or stock buybacks in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our future financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, legal restrictions general business conditions and other relevant factors as determined by our board of directors. See “Dividend Policy.”\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our third amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: \n•the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting; \n•rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; \n•the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; \n•a super-majority requirement to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and \n•the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\nDelaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe these provisions may help protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our Company immune from takeovers. In addition, although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to fluctuations as a result of a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including: failure of our operating results to meet market or analysts’ expectations; general fluctuations in the stock market; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results based on reduced and/or delayed government spending or the threat thereof; fluctuations in the stock prices of companies in our industry; changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; rumors or dissemination of false information; short selling of our common stock; litigation and government inquiries; political and/or military events associated with current worldwide conflicts; and domestic and foreign economic conditions. Such volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of many companies’ securities for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and, in the past, has led to securities class action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly traded company, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or be depressed.\nIn the future, we may issue our securities if we need to raise capital in connection with a capital expenditure, working capital requirement, acquisition or investment. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital expenditure, working capital requirement, acquisition or investment could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any perceived excess in the supply of our shares in the market could negatively impact our share price and any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results\nor prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be misstated, our reputation may be harmed and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. Our management has concluded that there are no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024. However, although we continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls, there can be no assurance that our controls over financial processes and reporting will be effective in the future or that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future. Any failure to remediate any future material weaknesses or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements or other public disclosures. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nLitigation may distract us from operating our business, and adverse judgments or settlements could adversely affect our\nfinancial results and operations.\nLitigation that may be brought by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenditures and distract our management from the operation of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in such litigation or resolve such litigation on terms favorable to us, which may adversely affect our financial results and operations. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report for a further discussion of our legal proceedings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline. \nThe trading market for our securities depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not influence or control the reporting of these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade or provide a negative outlook on our Company or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline.",
