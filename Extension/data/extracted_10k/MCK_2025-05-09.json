Our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.\nThe Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year refers to the Company’s fiscal year. The Company was incorporated on July 7, 1994 in the State of Delaware.\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), are available free of charge on the Company’s website (www.mckesson.com under the “Investors — Financials — SEC Filings” caption) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate sites) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.\nOur RxTS segment helps solve medication access, affordability and adherence challenges for patients by working across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies. RxTS serves our biopharma and life sciences partners, delivering innovative solutions that help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. RxTS offers technology services, which includes electronic prior authorization, prescription price transparency, benefit insight, and dispensing support services, in addition to third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support designed to benefit stakeholders.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. We offer more than 245,000 national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers in the U.S.\nOur International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in Canada and Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies, and support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions. During fiscal 2025, we completed the sale of Rexall and Well.ca businesses in Canada. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,”, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Segment:\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides distribution and logistics services for branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and OTC pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products to customers. This business provides solutions and services to pharmacies, hospitals, oncology and other specialty practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biopharma partners, physicians, payors, and patients throughout the U.S. We also source generic pharmaceutical drugs through our ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP joint venture with Walmart Inc. (“ClarusONE”).\nOur U.S. Pharmaceutical segment operates and serves customers through a network of 27 distribution centers in the U.S., including two strategic redistribution centers. We invest in technology and other systems at all of our distribution centers to enhance safety, reliability, and product availability. For example, we offer McKesson ConnectSM, an internet-based ordering system that provides item look-up and real-time inventory availability as well as ordering, purchasing, third-party reconciliation, and account management functionality. We make extensive use of technology as an enabler to ensure customers have the right products at the right time in the right place.\nTo maximize distribution efficiency and effectiveness, we follow the Six Sigma methodology, which is an analytical approach that emphasizes setting high-quality objectives, collecting data, and analyzing results to a fine degree in order to improve processes, reduce costs, and enhance service accuracy and safety. We provide solutions to our customers including supply management technology, world-class marketing programs, managed care, repackaging products, and services to help them meet their business and quality goals. We continue to implement information systems to help achieve greater consistency and accuracy both internally and for our customers, as well as make investments to increase capacity and automation.\nWe have four primary customer pharmaceutical distribution channels: (i) retail national accounts, which include national and regional retail chains, food and drug combinations, mail order pharmacies, and mass merchandisers, (ii) community pharmacies and health (formerly described as independent, small, and medium chain retail pharmacies), (iii) institutional healthcare providers such as hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, and long-term care providers, and (iv) oncology, biopharma, and other specialty partners.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nRetail National Accounts: We provide business solutions that help our retail national account customers increase revenues and profitability.

Community-based physicians in this business have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. Services in provider solutions include specialty drug distribution, group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) like Onmark®, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Vaccines for Children program.\nThis business provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines, and quality measurements to support The U.S. Oncology Network (“USON”), one of the nation’s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. SCRI Oncology, LLC, an oncology research business in which we own a 51% controlling interest, is one of the nation’s largest research networks and specializes in enhancing clinical trial access and availability across the country.\nThis segment includes Ontada®, McKesson’s oncology technology and insights business providing software to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs of our oncology practice customers. Ontada also partners with oncology providers and biopharma partners to perform real-world evidence studies, retrospective research, and to provide clinical data insights, advisory solutions and education opportunities.\nWhen we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage, and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nPrescription Technology Solutions Segment:\nOur Prescription Technology Solutions segment works across healthcare to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma to deliver medication access solutions that support patients from first prescription fill to ongoing therapy, regardless of their insurance coverage. RxTS has connections with most electronic health record systems, over 50,000 pharmacies, approximately 950,000 providers, most pharmacy benefit managers and health plans, and has supported over 650 biopharma brands representing most therapeutic areas. Through its industry connections and ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem, RxTS offers innovative solutions created to benefit healthcare stakeholders. Its comprehensive solution suites and technology services span across the entire patient journey, including medication access and affordability, prescription decision support, prescription price transparency, benefit insight and dispensing support services, as well as third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support, to help increase speed to therapy, reduce prescription abandonment, and support improved health outcomes for the patient. In the past year, RxTS helped patients save more than $10 billion on brand and specialty medications, helped to prevent an estimated 12 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and helped patients access their medicine more than 100 million times.\nMedical-Surgical Solutions Segment: \nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivers medical-supply distribution, logistics, biomedical maintenance, and other services to healthcare providers across the alternate-site spectrum. Our more than 340,000 customers include physician offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, and home health agencies. We partner with manufacturers and channel partners to support our key target end-markets, including primary care, extended care, government, and other markets. We distribute medical-surgical supplies (such as gloves, needles, syringes, and wound care products), infusion pumps, laboratory equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Through a network of distribution centers in the U.S., we offer more than 245,000 products from national brand manufacturers and McKesson’s own brand of high-quality products. Through the right mix of products and services, we help improve efficiencies, profitability, and compliance. We also never lose focus on helping customers improve patient and business outcomes. We develop customized plans to address the product, operational, and clinical support needs of our customers, including inventory management, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We deliver for our customers, so they can deliver and care for their patients. In May 2025, the Company announced its intention to separate this segment into an independent company.\nInternational Segment:\nOur International segment includes operations in Canada and Norway. McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a national network of distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers.\nBeyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation and technology solutions to its retail and hospital customers. Additionally, McKesson Canada provides comprehensive specialty health services to Canadians and provides biopharma services to manufacturers, including a national network of specialty pharmacies, personalized patient care and support programs, and INVIVA, Canada’s first and largest accredited network of private infusion clinics. McKesson Canada also owns and operates PDCI, Canada’s leading market access consultancy, supporting manufacturers as they introduce new products into the Canadian market.\nThe Canada retail business includes approximately 2,700 banner pharmacies under the IDA®, Guardian®, The Medicine Shoppe®, Remedy’sRx®, Proxim®, and Uniprix® banners. During fiscal 2025, we completed the previously announced transaction to sell our Rexall and Well.ca businesses. This divestiture is further described in Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nIn July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. We divested the majority of our European businesses during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Our remaining operations in Europe provide distribution and services to wholesale and retail customers in Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies. We continue to evaluate suitable exit alternatives for our retail and distribution businesses in Norway. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestitures.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nInvestments, Restructuring, Business Combinations, and Divestitures \nWe invest in new and existing distribution centers to increase scale and capacity, improve efficiency through automation and technology, and enhance regulatory compliance capabilities. Additionally, we invest in data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including artificial intelligence (“AI”). We are in the early stages of exploring potential AI capabilities and related data and analytics across our enterprise to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as enhance our products and services to better support patients, employees, and customers. \nWe have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to increase operational efficiencies, focus on our core healthcare businesses, execute our business strategy, and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” and Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive environments in North America and Norway. In recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. In the pharmaceutical distribution environment in which our U.S. Pharmaceutical and International segments operate, we face strong competition from international, national, regional, and local full-line, short-line, and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. We consider our largest competitors in distribution, wholesaling, and logistics to be Cencora, Inc. and Cardinal Health, Inc.\nOur RxTS business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other biopharma services companies, software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition in this business varies in size from large to small companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.\nOur Medical-Surgical Solutions segment experiences competition from a wide range of national and regional medical supply and equipment distributors throughout the U.S.\nIn addition, we compete with other service providers and healthcare manufacturers, as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We believe that our scale and diversity of product and service offerings are our primary competitive advantages. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation, adoption of new and evolving technologies, and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. \nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Licenses\nMcKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nWe believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nWe hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While in the future it may be necessary to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations as well as our products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.\nHuman Capital\nEverything we do at McKesson begins with our employees, who bring our mission and purpose to life every day. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 45,000 employees worldwide, which includes 2,000 part-time employees. We had approximately 36,000 employees in the U.S., 5,000 employees in Canada, and 4,000 employees in the rest of the world. We also supplement our work-force with contractors and/or consultants for certain business projects, processes, and/or operations as demand requires.\nCulture and Leadership: One of McKesson’s defining characteristics is our strong culture. We take pride in fostering a sense of belonging, finding meaning in our work, and caring for each other, our customers, and all those who depend on us. Our I2CARE values (Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) and ILEAD leadership behaviors (Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance, Develop) are at the core of our daily actions – from how we interact with each other and our customers, to how we make decisions, both big and small. We also offer all employees the opportunity to join employee resource groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary, employee-led, company-sponsored networks that aim to make a positive impact on our employees’ lives. Each ERG is non-exclusive and open to every employee. Our ERGs focus on helping employees make authentic connections, celebrate and learn from each other, showcase leadership skills and find ways to nurture and support belonging and empowerment.\nInvestment in Employees: We are committed to investing in our employees, so that they, in turn, can focus on furthering our purpose of Advancing Health Outcomes for All®. We offer employees health and wellness benefits focused on physical, mental, and social well-being, savings programs to help prepare them for retirement and flexible work arrangements, and other offerings. We also offer employees regular training, coaching, and 360-degree assessments, and financial assistance programs for higher education opportunities.\nWe seek to attract and retain the best talent through competitive compensation and pay for performance, while prioritizing recognition of merit and compliance with laws. Our compensation philosophy is rooted in a fair and transparent program that regularly conducts benchmarking to assess market rates for talent, based on geography and other factors. \nWe solicit employee feedback through annual and mid-year employee opinion surveys, which assesses our employees’ levels of engagement, commitment and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks, and then design action plans to improve those metrics. We also seek feedback on our people leaders through our annual manager quality survey, which is an opportunity for employees to help their managers grow professionally and build valuable leadership skills that help to promote a positive and productive workplace.\nHealth and Safety: Our security and safety teams employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate risks. This includes having procedures and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security. Our employees receive specialized training related to their role, work setting, and equipment used in their work environment.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in many highly regulated environments and are subject to oversight by various federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere. We incur significant expense and make large capital expenditures and investments to enable us to comply with laws and guidance promulgated by governmental entities. \nThe regulatory framework affecting our business and industry is continuously evolving and influenced by conditions such as public policy developments; shifts in governmental priorities, initiatives, and focus areas, including due to changes in federal, state, and local representation; and varied interpretations of laws and agency rulemaking conventions. These conditions create uncertainties for our business, and we are unable to predict the impact of future changes to the regulatory framework, or any prolonged uncertainty, on our operations and compliance costs.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nSee “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I below for information regarding material risks associated with our compliance with governmental regulations.\nOperational Licenses and Permits; Controlled Substances: We are subject to the operating and security standards of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, and comparable agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with governmental agencies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. For example, we are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, distribution, and disposal of controlled substances. We maintain extensive controlled substance monitoring and reporting programs at considerable expense in order to help us meet those standards.\nGovernment Contracts: Our contracts with governmental entities typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. These statutory and regulatory requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. We are subject to audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings about our compliance with contractual and legal requirements. \nHealthcare Program Regulation: Federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position on, and scrutiny of, practices that may indicate fraud, waste, and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other companies and individuals, as well as our provision of products and services to governmental entities, subject our business to statutes, regulations, and government guidance that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse. Among other things, those laws: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of an individual for, or to induce the ordering or purchasing of, items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs; (2) prohibit physicians from referring certain “designated health services” to an entity with which they have a financial relationship, unless an exception applies; and (3) prohibit knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government; and (4) require certain entities to report and return an overpayment by Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. \nMany of these healthcare fraud and abuse laws are vague or indefinite and are often subject to varied and evolving interpretations by courts, regulators, and enforcing agencies and, as such, may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense. \nIn the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors. The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) has begun to change benefit design and how Medicare pays for drugs, which are all intended to reduce the price of drugs. Three central features of the IRA have authorized the government to negotiate drug prices for certain Parts B and D drugs over time, establish an inflation rebate program, and cap patient cost sharing under Medicare Part D. \nProvincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic drug manufacturers.\nMcKesson continues to advocate for policies that would improve drug cost transparency under a patient's drug plan to better inform prescribing decisions, and also address access to care, affordability, and treatment regimen adherence, all designed to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the health spending burden.\nFDA Regulation and Supply Chain Integrity: In the U.S., the FDA is the principal federal authority that regulates the safety, efficacy, quality, testing, premarket approval, manufacture, labeling, storage, distribution, and post-market surveillance of healthcare products, such as drugs and medical devices, foods, and cosmetics.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nFederal and state laws regulate the pharmaceutical drug supply chain in order to prevent the distribution of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful prescription drugs in interstate commerce. At the federal level, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), among other things, requires standardized, unit-level traceability of pharmaceutical products along the entire drug supply chain and requires all trading partners to cooperate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. In October 2024, the FDA extended the compliance deadlines for the DSCSA interoperable unit-level traceability requirements to May 27, 2025, for manufacturers, August 27, 2025 for distributors, and November 27, 2025 for dispensers. The FDA stated that these extensions apply to trading partners who meet certain conditions. The Company believes its businesses are eligible for the extensions. The DSCSA also sets forth national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistic providers and other requirements applicable to these entities and the FDA has issued a proposed rule with respect to these requirements. These federal and state regulatory requirements have increased, and may further increase, our compliance burden and distribution costs.\nAdditionally, federal and state governments may adopt other laws intended to protect the integrity of the supply chain, and those laws could affect our distribution business. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and HHS issued a request for public comment in 2024 on how the practices of pharmaceutical wholesalers and group purchasing organizations impact generic drug shortages. Various industry stakeholders responded to this request, but no further action has been taken by the FTC or HHS. \nCybersecurity, Data Security, Privacy, and AI: We are subject to many cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our efforts to comply with these laws complicate our operations and add to our costs. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy laws in the U.S. Some privacy laws may prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions or otherwise limit our use and disclosure of data. Many of these laws also require us to provide access or other data rights (modification, deletion, portability, etc.) to consumers’ and patients’ individual personal data records within specified periods of time. Cybersecurity laws such as the federal Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, proposed changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and SEC reporting requirements may require us to provide notifications of certain cybersecurity incidents within short timeframes. Regulations and guidance targeting critical infrastructure entities, including McKesson, continue to be a focus of regulators. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various governmental agencies. There is also an emerging trend of governmental entities proposing and providing regulatory guidance related to AI, including generative AI. If we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any regulatory views, laws or other measures, it could impact our operations, increase our compliance expense and burden, and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI.\nEnvironmental Regulation: We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as laws governing the operation of radiation-emitting equipment at U.S. Oncology Network practices. \nWe sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain states have required and may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nClimate Change Regulation: Governments in the U.S. and abroad have adopted or are considering new or expanded policies and laws to address climate change. Such policies and laws may necessitate reductions in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; mandate that companies implement processes and controls to monitor and disclose climate-related matters; and impose additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, among other requirements. Compliance with climate-related policies and laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. Methodologies for reporting climate-related information may change and previously reported information may be retroactively adjusted, if required. New or expanded climate-related policies and laws could impose costs on us, including capital expenditures to develop data gathering and reporting systems, third-party attestations, and additional GHG reduction measures. Until the timing and extent of climate-related policies and laws are clarified, including due to legal challenges, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.\n\nItem 1 Index      \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nAntitrust Laws: Antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. and elsewhere prohibit types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare industry remains a focus of the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Some of our strategic transactions may require review by competition regulators, with inherent delays. Violations of the antitrust laws can result in sanctions and other adverse actions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs also may bring civil lawsuits for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. These laws contribute to our compliance efforts and expense, and their enforcement might materially adversely affect our operations and growth strategy.\nOther Information about the Business\nCustomers: During fiscal 2025, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 72% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2023, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS to June 2027. Our ten largest customers comprised approximately 48%, and CVS was approximately 23% of our total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2025. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. \nSuppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers and our largest supplier accounted for 11% of our total purchases in fiscal 2025. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2025 accounted for approximately 69% of our total purchases.\nSome of our distribution arrangements with manufacturers provide us consideration based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based consideration component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.\nResearch and Development: Research and development expenses were $91 million, $77 million, and $89 million for the years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nFinancial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations: Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations is discussed in Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report as well as in “Foreign Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I below for information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations. \nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report and the “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “targets,” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of trends, strategy, plans, prospects, assumptions, expectations, or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied.

      "text": "Item 1A.    Risk Factors. \nINDEX TO RISK FACTORS\n\nSection                                     Page\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks               13\nCompany and Operational Risks                 16\nIndustry and Economic Risks                   20\nGeneral Risks                                 23\nThe discussion below identifies certain representative risks that might cause our actual business results to materially differ from our estimates. It is not practical to identify or describe all risks and uncertainties that might materially impact our business operations, reputation, financial position, or results of operations. Our business could be materially affected by risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider to be immaterial. This is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe experience costly and disruptive legal disputes.\nWe are routinely named as a defendant in litigation or regulatory proceedings and other legal disputes, which may include asserted class action litigation, such as those described in Financial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Regulatory proceedings involve allegations such as false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, and antitrust violations. Civil litigation proceedings involve commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, tort, and other claims. Despite valid defenses that we assert, legal disputes are often costly, time-consuming, distracting to management, and disruptive to normal business operations. The uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal disputes might harm our business and reputation even if the matter ultimately is favorably resolved. The outcome of legal disputes is difficult to predict, and outcomes may occur that we believe are not justified by the evidence or existing law. Outcomes include monetary damages, penalties and fines, and injunctive or other relief that requires us to change our business operations and incur significant expense. Accordingly, legal disputes might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nWe experience losses not covered by insurance or indemnification.\nOur business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses, practice support services, and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. For example, pharmacy operations are exposed to risks such as improper filling of prescriptions, mislabeling of prescriptions, inadequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs, and expiration of drugs. Although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage, such as property insurance for inventory and professional and general liability insurance, coverages on acceptable terms might be unavailable, or coverages might not cover our losses. We generally seek to limit our contractual exposure, but limitations of liability or indemnity provisions in our contracts may not be enforceable or adequately protect us from liability. Uninsured or non-indemnified losses might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe experience costly legal disputes, government actions, and adverse publicity regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids.\nThe Company is a defendant in many litigation matters alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids), as described in Financial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. We are sometimes named as a defendant in similar, new cases. The plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities (such as states, provinces, counties, and municipalities) as well as businesses, groups, and individuals. The cases allege violations of controlled substance laws and other laws, and they make common law claims such as negligence and public nuisance. Many of these cases raise novel theories of liability and can have unexpected outcomes that we believe are not justified by evidence or existing law. Legal proceedings such as these often involve significant expense, management time and distraction, and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. Outcomes include monetary damages, penalties and fines, and injunctive or other relief that requires us to change our business operations and incur significant expense. Although the Company has valid defenses and is vigorously defending itself, some proceedings have been, and others may be, resolved by negotiated outcome. For example, we are subject to consent decrees issued by state courts that govern our distribution of controlled substances. Not all proceedings, however, are resolved by settlement. Our reputation has been and may continue to be impacted by publicity regarding opioids litigation and related allegations. An adverse outcome of any such legal proceedings might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe experience increased costs to distribute controlled substances such as opioids.\nLegislative, regulatory, or industry measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments or other costs of compliance under any such laws might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex, and challenging healthcare, environmental, and other laws.\nAs described in “Government Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I above, our industry is highly regulated, and further regulation of our distribution businesses, technology products, and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the Company to litigation and regulatory investigations. We incur cleanup costs under environmental laws and may incur additional costs under environmental laws. Additionally, we are subject to various routine and ad hoc inspections and requests for information by governmental agencies to determine compliance with various statutes and regulations. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws, or the failure to maintain, renew, or obtain necessary permits and licenses, could lead to enforcement actions or litigation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. \n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nWe are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse.\nAs described in “Government Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I above, federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position on, and scrutiny of, practices that may indicate fraud, waste, and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Those laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense. Alleged failures to comply with those laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, expose us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties. Such failures might result in the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal and state healthcare programs, or pursue government contracts. These sanctions might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might lose our ability to purchase, store, or distribute pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances, and medical products.\nAs described in “Government Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I above, we are subject to the operating, quality, regulatory, and security requirements of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, CMS, and other agencies. Noncompliance with these requirements can result in inspectional observations, warning letters, product recalls, withdrawals or other market action, fines, seizures, injunctions, and other administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement actions. Noncompliance, enforcement actions or adverse decisions by regulators, or the inability to obtain, maintain, or renew permits, licenses, or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nPrivacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and AI laws increase our compliance burden.\nAs described in “Government Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I above, we are subject to a variety of privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and AI laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, reputational impacts, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy and data security laws. The use of AI solutions by our employees or third parties on which we rely could also lead to the misuse of data or public disclosure of confidential information (including personal data or proprietary information) in contravention of our internal policies, applicable laws, contractual requirements, or third-party intellectual property rights. Our efforts to comply with privacy, data security, and AI laws complicate our operations and add to our costs. A significant cybersecurity and/or privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy and data security laws, by us or by external service providers, vendors, or other third parties with which we do business, might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption laws increase our compliance burden.\nWe are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar regulations in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nCompany and Operational Risks\nWe might record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets.\nWe are required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, burdensome new laws or other adverse legal developments, or divestiture of a business or asset for less than its carrying value. There are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, a deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates, an increase in inflation, or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry, or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. We have in the past recorded, and may be required to record, a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined, which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. See Financial Note 10, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” for descriptions of impairments of goodwill or intangible or other long-lived assets in recent periods.\nWe experience cybersecurity incidents that might significantly compromise our technology systems or might result in material data breaches.\nWe, our external service providers, vendors, and other third parties with which we do business, use technology and systems to perform our business operations, such as the secure electronic transmission, processing, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information and other types of personal information, confidential financial information, proprietary information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company, and workforce. Despite our physical, technical, and administrative security measures as well as third party risk management processes as discussed in “Cybersecurity” in Item 1C of Part I below, technology systems and operations of the Company and third parties, including our external service providers and vendors, with which we do business, have experienced cybersecurity incidents and are subject to future cyberattacks and cybersecurity incidents. Companies in the healthcare industry are increasingly targeted for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents include unauthorized occurrences on or conducted through our or our third parties’ information systems, such as tampering, malware insertion, ransomware attacks, or other system integrity events. The risk and efficacy of cyberattacks increases from time to time due to a variety of internal and external factors, including, but not limited to, the adoption of sophisticated and rapidly evolving techniques, such as adversarial AI, and during political or military unrest. Our adoption of AI also may create new attack surfaces or methods and generally increase cybersecurity and data protection risks and costs. A cybersecurity incident might involve a material data breach or other material impact to the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and operations of our technology systems or data, which might result in harm to patients, consumers, or employees; litigation or regulatory action; disruption of our business operations; loss of customers or revenue; cash flow impacts; and increased expense. Additionally, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, regulators, and the public. Any cybersecurity incident might have a materially adverse impact on our business, our operations, our reputation, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe experience significant problems with information systems or networks.\nWe rely on sophisticated information systems and networks to perform our business operations, such as to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data that facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from distribution centers. We provide remote services that involve hosting customer data and operating software on our own or third-party systems. Our customers rely on their ability to access and use these systems, and their data, as needed, and our ability to compete effectively is increasingly dependent on access to, and interpretation of, data. Data quality impacts customer ordering, order fulfillment and higher order processing. If we fail to effectively implement and maintain data governance structures across our businesses, to effectively interpret and utilize such data, or protect the integrity of such data, including systems \n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\npowered by or incorporating AI and machine learning, our operations could be impacted, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Our networks and hosting systems are also vulnerable to interruption or damage from sources beyond our control. When those information systems or networks are disrupted, or if the timely delivery of medical care or other customer business requirements are impaired, we experience injury to patients or consumers, litigation or regulatory action, disruption of our business operations, loss of customers or revenue, cash flow impacts, and increased expense. In addition, hardware, software, and other applications and updates procured from third parties may contain defects that have, or may in the future, unexpectedly restrict access to or interfere with the proper operations of our information systems and hardware. Any such problems might have a materially adverse impact on our business, our reputation, and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur technology products or services might not conform to specifications or perform as we intend.\nWe sell and provide services involving complex software and technology that may contain errors, especially when first introduced to market. Healthcare professionals delivering patient care tend to have heightened sensitivity to system and software errors. If our software and technology services are alleged to have contributed to faulty clinical decisions, compromised continuity of patient care, or injury to patients, we might be subject to regulatory scrutiny or, claims by users of our software or services and/or their patients. Errors or failures might damage our reputation and negatively affect future sales. A failure of a system or software to conform to specifications might constitute a breach of warranty that could result in repair costs, contract termination, refunds, or claims for damages. These risks can be heightened upon the adoption of new technologies, including AI, and may introduce new or expanded risks, such as data inaccuracy, unreliability, or bias. Any of these types of errors or failures might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nPharmaceutical and medical products that we distribute might not conform to specifications or perform as intended.\nWe distribute pharmaceutical, medical, and other FDA-regulated products manufactured by third parties and by our private label businesses, including medications that may be temperature sensitive or have limited shelf lives. Our systems and procedures are designed to maintain the safety and efficacy of the products throughout the sourcing and distribution process. Issues affecting product safety or efficacy can arise from manufacturing, storing, distributing, dispensing or using products, and can result in adverse consequences such as safety alerts, seizures, bans, recalls, withdrawals or other market action, suspensions, and other regulatory actions and sanctions, civil lawsuits, increased costs, disruptions, delays, and reputational damage. Any of these types of issues or results might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might not realize expected benefits from business process initiatives.\nFrom time to time, we implement restructuring, cost reduction, or other business process initiatives that result in significant charges and expenses. These initiatives might fail to achieve our desired objectives or have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be unable to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nOur growth strategy includes consummating acquisitions or other strategic transactions that either expand or complement our business. To fund these strategic transactions, we may require financing that may not be available on acceptable terms. We may not receive governmental approvals needed to complete proposed transactions, or such approvals may be subject to delays or conditions that reduce transaction benefits. Achieving the desired outcomes of these strategic transactions involves significant risks including: diverting management’s attention from other business operations; challenges with assimilating the acquired businesses, such as integration of operations, systems, and technologies; failure or delay in realizing operating synergies; difficulty retaining key acquired company personnel; unanticipated accounting or financial systems issues with the acquired business, which might affect our internal controls over financial reporting; disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses; unanticipated compliance issues in the acquired business; unknown or unanticipated cybersecurity issues; challenges retaining customers of the acquired business; unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings, including depreciation and amortization or potential impairment charges; and risks of known and unknown assumed liabilities in the acquired business. These risks at times have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nFrom time to time we are adversely impacted by delays or other difficulties with divestitures.\nWhen we decide to sell or otherwise divest assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. After the disposition, we might experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue or profit might be larger than we expected. We might have difficulties with pre-closing conditions such as governmental approvals, which could delay or prevent the divestiture. We might have financial exposure in a divested business, such as through minority equity ownership, financial or performance guarantees, indemnities, or other obligations, such that conditions outside of our control might negate the expected benefits of the disposition. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of a divestiture and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might not realize the expected tax treatment from our split-off of Change Healthcare.\nOn March 10, 2020, the Company completed a separation of its interest in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”). The divestiture was effected through the split-off of PF2 SpinCo, Inc. (“SpinCo”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that held all of the Company’s interest in the Change Healthcare JV, to certain of the Company’s stockholders through an exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”), followed by a merger of SpinCo with and into Change Healthcare Inc. (“Change”), with Change surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the Exchange Offer, the “Transactions”). The Company received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that the Transactions qualified as generally tax-free transactions to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An opinion of legal counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the intended tax-free treatment of the Transactions. In addition, the opinion could not be relied upon if certain assumptions, representations, and undertakings upon which the opinion was based are materially inaccurate or incomplete, or are violated in any material respect. If the intended tax-free treatment of the Transactions is not sustained, the Company and its stockholders who participated in the Transactions may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes. In connection with the Transactions, the Company, SpinCo, Change, and the Change Healthcare JV entered into the Tax Matters Agreement, which governs their respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests, and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, and local, and non-U.S. taxes, other tax matters, and related tax returns. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Change is required to indemnify the Company if the Transactions become taxable as a result of certain actions by Change or SpinCo, or as a result of certain changes in ownership of the stock of Change after the Merger. If Change does not honor its obligations to indemnify the Company, or if the Transactions fail to qualify for the intended tax-free treatment for reasons not related to a disqualifying action by Change or SpinCo, the resulting tax to the Company could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nWe might be adversely impacted by outsourcing or similar third-party relationships.\nWe rely on third parties to perform certain business and administrative functions for us. We might not adequately develop, implement, and monitor these outsourced service providers, and we might not realize expected cost savings or other benefits. Third-party service providers experience cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions and can fail to perform their obligations due to various causes, which might cause us to incur operational difficulties, additional compliance requirements, or increased costs related to outsourced services. For example, our ability to use outsourcing resources in certain jurisdictions might be limited by legislative action or customer contracts, with the result that the work must be performed at greater expense or we may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in achieving our strategic growth objectives.\nOur business strategy as a diversified healthcare services company includes investing to build an integrated oncology and specialty care platform and expand our biopharma services business. Our ability to grow those businesses will depend on our: hiring and retaining talented individuals with necessary knowledge and skills; acquiring, developing, and implementing new technologies and capabilities, including AI; forming and expanding business relationships; and successfully competing against providers of similar services. New technologies, such as AI, may not result in the benefits we anticipate, may not enable us to maintain a competitive advantage, and may require us to expend significant resources. We have increased, and expect to continue to increase, our use of AI technology. The AI technologies we employ may become obsolete earlier than planned or we may be unsuccessful at realizing the benefits of these investments. Additionally, some of our historical competitors and a growing number of new competitive entrants have more experience than we do in enabling technologies such as data analytics, machine learning, or AI. We may not achieve our desired return on our investments through our growth strategies. If we fail to achieve acceptable sales and profitability in our strategic growth areas, it might have a materially adverse impact on our business prospects and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are impacted by customer purchase reductions, contract non-renewals, payment defaults, and bankruptcies.\nSome of our customers from time to time reduce the amounts they purchase from us, do not renew their purchase contracts with us, renew their purchase contracts at less favorable terms, delay or default on their payments to us, or avoid payments to us through bankruptcy proceedings. At March 31, 2025, sales to our largest customer represented approximately 24% of our total consolidated revenues and approximately 23% of our total trade receivables, and those of our ten largest customers combined accounted for approximately 72% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 48% of our trade receivables. Refer to “Other Information about the Business” in Item 1 of Part I above for additional details on our customers. One or more customer purchase reductions, contract non-renewals, renewals at less favorable terms, payment defaults, or bankruptcies might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur contracts with governmental entities involve future funding and compliance risks.\nOur contracts with governmental entities are subject to risks such as lack of funding and compliance with unique requirements. For example, government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding, which may be eliminated or reduced. In addition, the future volume of products or services purchased by a government customer is often uncertain. Our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little prior notice. They might be modified with less favorable terms. Government contracts typically expose us to higher potential liability than do other types of contracts. In addition, government contracts typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. For example, our contracts with the U.S. government generally require us to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Procurement Integrity Act, Buy American Act, Trade Agreements Act, and other laws and requirements. New or revised laws, requirements, and policies, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, requirements, and policies, could adversely affect our business and competitiveness and increase our compliance costs. We are subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings. Governmental agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we may be subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts, and suspension or debarment from government contract work. These requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our reputation and might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nWe might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers.\nWe attempt to structure our distribution agreements with manufacturers to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide. Certain distribution agreements with manufacturers include product price inflation as a component of our consideration, and we cannot control the frequency or magnitude of price changes. Laws limiting or reducing product prices, and changes to manufacturers’ pricing policies or practices as a result of changing laws, impact our distribution agreements. We might be unable to renew distribution agreements with manufacturers in a timely and favorable manner. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might infringe intellectual property rights or our intellectual property protections might be inadequate.\nWe believe that our products and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and may do so in the future. If a court were to hold that we infringed other’s rights, we might be required to pay substantial damages, develop non-infringing products or services, obtain a license, stop selling or using the infringing products or services, or incur other sanctions. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, nondisclosure obligations, and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. We might initiate costly and time-consuming litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright, and trademark rights, and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property protection efforts might be inadequate to protect our rights. Our competitors might develop non-infringing products or services equivalent or superior to ours. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nOur use of third-party data is subject to risks and limitations that could impede the growth of our data services business.\nWe attempt to structure our processes to satisfy contractual and other operative data usage rights and limitations associated with customers, industry partners, and other third-party data flowing through our businesses. These rights and limitations can apply to confidential commercial data and personal data provided to us. Failure to satisfy these data usage rights and limitations can lead to legal claims such as contractual breaches or data protection and privacy law violations. If a court were to hold that our use of data is not consistent with our rights and limitations, we might be required to pay substantial damages; we might need to stop using, sharing, and/or selling certain products and services; or we might incur other financial, legal, and/or reputational consequences. In addition, we might be unable to negotiate and/or obtain at an acceptable cost the data usage rights needed to advance our data strategy growth and AI objectives. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to attract, engage, develop, and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key executives and other talent, is essential for us to meet our objectives. We compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. Competition among potential employers results in increased salaries, benefits, or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees. We may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, such as illness; and although we must adequately plan for timely succession of key management roles, our succession plans might not be effective, and employees might not successfully transition into new roles. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nWe might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models.\nMany of our products and services are designed to function within the structure of current healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. The healthcare industry and related government programs are changing. Some of these changes increase our risks and create uncertainties for our business. \nFor example, some changes in reimbursement methodologies (including government rates) for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments, and related services reduce profit margins for us and our customers and impose new legal requirements on healthcare providers. Those changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the bases for payments, shifts from fee-for-service pricing towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and increases in the use of managed care.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nIn the U.S., the ACA significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors. Enactment of the IRA and its implementation over the next several years is anticipated to bring meaningful changes in how Medicare pays for drugs and various benefit design changes, which are all intended to reduce the price of drugs. Three central features of the IRA authorize the government to negotiate drug prices for certain Parts B and D drugs over time, establish an inflationary rebate program, and cap patient cost sharing under Medicare Part D. The implementation of these and other features of the IRA may result in significant changes to the pharmaceutical value chain as manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, and other industry stakeholders look to implement new transactional flows and adapt their business models. Any such changes to arrangements involving our business as a result of this legislation, such as changes to our distribution agreements with manufacturers impacted by the IRA, may materially affect our business. The extent of the effects of the IRA remains uncertain due to a number of factors, including the potential for future regulations and guidance promulgated by HHS to implement provisions of the IRA. We continue to evaluate the impact of this law on our business.\nPrivate challenges to government healthcare policy may also have significant impacts on our business. For example, many pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally restricted sales under the Public Health Service’s 340B Drug Pricing Program (the “340B program”) to contract pharmacies. The 340B program requires manufacturers to offer discounts on certain drugs purchased by “covered entities,” which include safety-net providers. The Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) has taken the position that a covered entity may dispense such discounted drugs through multiple contract pharmacies. Starting in 2020, some manufacturers began to restrict such practices. Certain manufacturers and HHS continue to litigate these issues. The U.S. Courts of Appeal for the Third and D.C. Circuits have ruled that Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act does not require manufacturers to provide discounted drugs to an unlimited number of contract pharmacies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit also is addressing this issue but has not yet ruled. Separately, several entities have filed lawsuits against HHS and HRSA related to the proposed implementation of rebate models to effectuate 340B pricing. Any changes to our arrangements that result from the rulings in these cases might have an adverse impact on our business.\nProvincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers.\nAlthough there is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood, timing, and results of these health reform efforts and challenges, their implementation or outcome might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation.\nOur businesses face a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional, and local full-line, short-line, and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. In addition, our businesses face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We also may face competition from companies that move faster to adopt emerging technologies. Due to consolidation, a few large suppliers control a significant share of the pharmaceuticals market. This concentration reduces our ability to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and causes us to depend on a smaller number of suppliers. Many of our customers, including healthcare organizations, have consolidated or joined group purchasing organizations and have greater power to negotiate favorable prices. Consolidation by our customers, suppliers, and competitors might reduce the number of market participants and give the remaining enterprises greater bargaining power, which might lead to erosion in our profit margin. Consolidation might increase counterparty credit risk because credit purchases increase for fewer market participants. Consolidation also might affect our ability to achieve our growth objectives through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These competitive pressures and industry consolidation might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have difficulties in sourcing or selling products due to a variety of causes and are adversely impacted by disruptions or changes in product supply. \nWe rely on third parties for the supply of pharmaceutical and other products, and our operations are subject to our suppliers’ continued ability to supply the products that we require. From time to time, we experience difficulties and delays in \n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nsourcing and selling products due to a variety of causes that result in suppliers’ failure to satisfy production demand. Among these causes are suppliers’ challenges in complying with legal requirements (including product and production quality standards), access to raw materials, inputs, and finished goods, manufacturing shutdowns, and operational and systems difficulties. Supply disruptions also arise from other factors beyond our control, such as product rationalization; government actions or policies (including trade sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions, as well as the requisition, diversion, or allocation of inventory); shifts in customer or societal demand for products; labor disputes or shortages; ethical sourcing issues; supplier financial distress; natural disasters and weather-related events; civil unrest; military conflicts; and epidemics or pandemics. In these types of situations, our alternative sourcing efforts are not always fully successful. We might experience extended delays or incur higher sourcing costs or suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation. Furthermore, changes in the healthcare industry’s or our suppliers’ pricing, selling, inventory, distribution, or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Any of these disruptions or changes might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals. \nOur generic pharmaceuticals distribution business is subject to both product availability and pricing risks. We might experience disruptions in our supply of generic pharmaceuticals. We have been impacted when, due to regulatory and supply chain challenges, our supplier partners are not able to deliver products that we have committed to source from them. Input cost increases, product discontinuations, and market shortages could result in ClarusONE, our joint venture with Walmart Inc., being unsuccessful in sourcing product to meet the needs of our customers, or could negatively impact our margin. Generic drug manufacturers offer a generic version of branded pharmaceuticals and routinely challenge the validity or enforceability of branded pharmaceutical patents in order to launch the drug pre- or post-loss of exclusivity. Patent holders have asserted infringement claims against us for distributing those generic versions they believed to have infringed a patent, and the generic drug manufacturers may not fully indemnify us against such claims. These risks and outcomes, as well as changes in the nature, frequency, or magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches, might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are adversely impacted by changes in the economic environments in which we operate, including from inflation, an economic slowdown, a recession, or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInflationary conditions result in increased costs associated with our normal business operations and decreased levels of consumer commercial spending and, to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases from our suppliers, increase the costs which we incur to purchase inventories and services. Inflationary pressure is increased by factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor market tightness, actual or announced tariffs, government policies, interest rate changes, and foreign exchange rate changes. An economic slowdown or a recession could also reduce the prices our customers are able or willing to pay for our products and services and reduce the volume of their purchases. In addition to rising inflation, rising interest rates, the impact of banking failures or perceived failures and related contagion, consumer sentiment, political circumstances, military conflicts, and civil unrest may contribute to recessionary pressure. Our non-U.S. operations, import and export of products sold in non-U.S. dollar (USD) denominations, non-USD intercompany loans, and our substantial international net assets also expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Changes in the economic environments in which we operate might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nChanges affecting capital and credit markets might impede access to credit, increase borrowing costs, and disrupt banking services for us and our customers and suppliers and might impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.\nVolatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by financial institutions, reduced creditworthiness of our customers or suppliers, or decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market, might adversely affect the borrowing ability and cost of borrowing for us and our customers and suppliers. Credit rating agencies regularly review our credit and rate our outstanding debt; and any downgrades in our credit ratings might limit our access to public debt markets, decrease financial institutions willingness to lend to us, lead to more restrictive debt covenants, increase our borrowing costs, and adversely affect our earnings. We generally sell our products and services under short-term unsecured credit arrangements. An adverse change in general or entity-specific economic conditions or access to capital might cause our customers to reduce their purchases from us, or delay payments, or fail to pay amounts, owed to us. Suppliers might increase their prices, reduce their output, or change their terms of sale due to limited availability of credit. Suppliers might be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products, or incentives. Interest rate increases or changes in capital market conditions, including as a result of macroeconomic \n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nevents, might impede our or our customers’ or suppliers’ ability or cost to obtain credit. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. at the federal, state, and local government levels and to the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services. Tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, and cash flow. The tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. For example, the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis which many jurisdictions have enacted or committed to enact. The impact of these new and potential regulations as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate. We are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us. Our tax reporting positions are sometimes challenged by relevant tax authorities, we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges, and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts. Developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, our cash flows, and our financial position or results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nConditions and events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues, natural disasters, and geopolitical factors adversely impact our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are adversely affected by conditions and events outside of our control, including: widespread public health issues such as epidemic or pandemic infectious diseases; natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, or severe weather; and geopolitical factors such as terrorism, military conflicts, civil unrest, political circumstances (including changes in international relations), changes or uncertainty in government policies (including with respect to U.S. or international trade), actual or announced tariffs or other trade restrictions, or changes in laws or their interpretation. These conditions and events can disrupt operations for us, our suppliers, our vendors, and our customers, as well as impair product manufacturing, supply, and transport availability and cost in unpredictable ways that depend on highly uncertain future developments. They might affect consumer confidence levels and spending or the availability of certain goods, commodities, raw materials, and other inputs. In response to these types of conditions and events, we might seek alternate sources for product supply, incur additional sourcing or distribution costs, suspend operations, implement extraordinary procedures, or suffer consequences that are unexpected and difficult to mitigate. For example, recently imposed or announced U.S. tariffs, as well as any retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions imposed by other countries, might require us to incur substantial additional sourcing costs, raise prices on certain products, or seek alternate supply sources. If we are unable to effectively manage or offset the impact of new tariffs or other trade restrictions, or find alternate sources of supply, we might be competitively disadvantaged or experience reduced profit margins or supply disruptions. Further, we might suffer harm to our customer relationships. Any of the foregoing risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), costs for critical services (such as transportation costs), and other adverse effects. The effects could impair, for example, the availability and cost of certain products, commodities, transportation, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services, and transport those goods, required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. We bear losses incurred as a result of, for example, physical damage to or destruction of our facilities (such as distribution or fulfillment centers), loss or spoilage of inventory due to unusual ambient temperatures, and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change. These risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operation.\n\nItem 1A Index     \nMcKESSON CORPORATION\n\nEvolving expectations and regulatory requirements related to governance and sustainability matters may damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInvestors, regulators, employees, customers, and other stakeholders continue to focus on companies’ governance and sustainability (“G&S”) practices and policies, including those related to human capital management, climate change, environmental responsibility, and social impact. Given the varied and at times divergent views of different stakeholder groups, any action or inaction by us with respect to G&S matters may be perceived negatively by some stakeholders. Furthermore, the G&S regulatory landscape is evolving and uncertain. New or revised laws and policies, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and policies, could increase our compliance costs and expose us to legal risks. From time to time, we make statements regarding our sustainability goals. Although we intend to meet these goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could impose costs on us. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of these goals, or for any revisions to our goals. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business investments over the achievement of our sustainability goals based on various factors such as our business strategy, technological and regulatory developments, industry standards, and input or pressure from stakeholders. If our G&S practices or outcomes do not align with stakeholder expectations or evolving regulatory requirements, our reputation, stock price, ability to access capital markets, and employee recruitment and retention efforts might be negatively affected. We also could face litigation or government action. Any of the foregoing risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nExclusive forum provisions in our Bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for specified legal actions is the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction (collectively, “Delaware Courts”). Current and former stockholders are deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in connection with any action to enforce that exclusive forum provision and to service of process in any such action. These provisions of the bylaws are not a waiver of, and do not relieve anyone of duties to comply with, federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Exchange Act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act. To the extent that these provisions of the bylaws limit a current or former stockholder’s ability to select a judicial forum other than the Delaware Courts, they might discourage the specified legal actions, might cause current or former stockholders to incur additional litigation-related expenses, and might result in outcomes unfavorable to current or former stockholders. A court might determine that these provisions of the bylaws are inapplicable or unenforceable in any particular action, in which case we may incur additional litigation related expenses in such action, and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us, which could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, our business operations, and our financial position or results of operations.",
