      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. Built on a century of experience and conducting business in over 120 countries, our innovative technologies and services are taking energy forward.\nOUR VISION & STRATEGY\nWith our diverse portfolio, leading technology, and unique partnership models, we are positioned to deliver outcome-based solutions across the energy and industrial markets. By integrating health, safety & environment (\"HSE\") into everything we do, we protect our people, our customers, and the environment.\nThe oil and gas macroeconomic environment continues to be complex. While we believe the world will need hydrocarbons for many decades to come - and therefore oil and gas will continue to remain relevant in meeting global energy demand - we also acknowledge the need to transition to new energy sources. Over the last several years, this transition has progressed, with governments and society focused on a long-term goal of net-zero emissions while trying to balance the \"energy trilemma\" - energy security, sustainability, and affordability. There is a growing consensus the energy transition will likely take longer than many expected due to its inherent complexity overcoming technology, economics, politics, and regulatory challenges.\nWe believe the industry is going through a transformation that requires a change in how work gets done to enable sustainable energy development. Our existing and new customers require new partnerships, commercial models and technology solutions to deliver sustainable productivity improvements and leverage economies of scale, with a lower carbon footprint. That is why our strategy is focused on improving our core competitiveness and delivering higher-productivity solutions today, while positioning to lead the energy transition and solving the energy trilemma. Our unique and diversified portfolio is expected to benefit regardless of how quickly the energy transition develops.\nOur strategy is based on three key pillars:\n•Transform the core: We are transforming our current business to improve margins and cash flow, which we are achieving through portfolio rationalization, cost improvement, and new business models.\n•Driving profitable growth: We are driving organic and inorganic growth to build our businesses in high potential markets where we have a strong position, including integrated solutions, mature assets solutions, and enhanced digital solutions.\n•Delivering results in new energy: We are making strategic investments to drive lower carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors, including hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization and storage (\"CCUS\"); geothermal; and clean power solutions (\"clean power\" refers to lower carbon intensity, lower lifecycle emissions, and lower quantity of greenhouse gas emissions resulting directly from fuel combustion, relative to conventional power sources derived from fossil fuels).\nWe expect to benefit from our strategy in the following ways:\n•Scope and scale: We have a global presence and a broad, diversified portfolio. Our products, services, and expertise serve the upstream, midstream/liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, as well as broader chemical and industrial segments across a variety of verticals. We deliver through our two operating segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\") as discussed below under \"Products and Services,\" and each are among the top providers for the majority of the product lines in the markets they serve.\n•Technology: Our culture is built on a heritage of innovation and invention through research and development, with complementary capabilities. Technology remains a differentiator for us and a key enabler to drive the efficiency and productivity gains our customers require, as well as paving the way for longer term sustainable energy development. We also have a range of technologies that support our customers' \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 1\n\n\nefforts to reduce their carbon footprint. We remain committed to investing in our products and services to maintain our leadership position across our offerings, including $643 million research and development (\"R&D\") spend and being granted more than 1,600 patents worldwide in 2024.\n•Energy transition solutions: We are positioned to support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint with a range of emissions-abatement products and services, which we refer to as \"new energy.\" This includes turnkey solutions for flare reduction, CCUS, hydrogen production, transportation, storage and distribution, geothermal and clean power solutions. Over the past several years, we have made progress in strategic investments and acquisitions in emerging energy technologies to advance CCUS, hydrogen, clean power and e-fuels, as well as established strategic long-term partnerships with companies such as HIF Global, Air Products and NET Power, among others. We also continue to expand our low to zero-carbon solutions capabilities, helping customers to detect, quantify, and reduce emissions more efficiently and accurately, and complementing our existing solutions.\n•Digital capabilities: We expect to benefit from the emerging demand for more intelligent operations and the adoption of artificial intelligence (\"AI\") based solutions as part of our customers' digital transformation initiatives. In 2024, we launched CarbonEdgeTM, powered by CordantTM, an end-to-end digital solution for CCUS operations. We also signed an agreement with Repsol to collaboratively develop and deploy next-generation AI capabilities through our Leucipa™ automated field production solution.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur two operating segments are organized based on the nature of our markets and customers. We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line. See discussion below by segment.\nOilfield Services & Equipment\nThe OFSE segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services and integrated solutions for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the life cycle of an asset, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning.\nBeyond its traditional oilfield concentration, OFSE is also expanding its capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of the energy transition, including focusing on new energy areas, such as geothermal and CCUS, strengthening its digital architecture, and addressing key energy market themes.\nThe OFSE segment is organized into four product lines.\n•Well Construction focuses on drilling and includes drilling services (directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface logging, and remote operations), drill bits (polycrystalline, roller cone, hybrid, and in-bit sensing), and drilling & completion fluids (emulsion-based, water-based, specialty, drill-in, and completion fluids; and waste management).\n•Completions, Intervention, and Measurements encompasses completions (wellbore construction, upper and lower completions, unconventional multistage completions, intelligent production systems, workover systems, and fishing and through-tubing services), pressure pumping (cementing, production enhancement, coiled tubing, and tubular running services), and wireline services (openhole logging services, cased-hole logging services, and perforating and drill stem-testing services).\n•Production Solutions spans artificial lift systems (electrical submersible pumping systems, surface pumping systems, rigless deployment systems, and sensors and gauges) and oilfield & industrial chemicals (upstream, downstream, and AquanessTM wholesale chemicals).\n•Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems includes subsea projects and services (subsea trees, controls, manifolds, wellheads, premium casing connectors, installation and commissioning, repairs and maintenance, well intervention, life-of-field solutions, and plug and abandonment), flexible pipe systems \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 2\n\n\n(subsea risers, subsea flowlines and jumpers, onshore reinforced thermoplastic pipe, and rehabilitation), and surface pressure control systems (surface trees and wellheads).\nThese product lines are supported by an OFSE digital group, which combines OFSE's domain expertise with a deep understanding of digital technology to improve operational safety, performance, and sustainability.

We also conduct business in a number of industrial \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 4\n\n\nmarkets and provide critical equipment hardware capability for full plant offerings, asset performance management and process optimization.\nWe benefit from stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer's technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers.\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. In connection with oil and gas operations, our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices (e.g., in connection with industrial and/or digital sectors), we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct, or in the event of breaches of applicable laws or breach of confidentiality and/or intellectual property rights. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices.\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.\nORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nRemaining performance obligations (\"RPO\"), a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.\nWe recognized orders of $28.2 billion, $30.5 billion, and $26.8 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $15.2 billion, $16.3 billion, and $14.1 billion, and IET orders of $13.0 billion, $14.2 billion, and $12.7 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining performance obligations totaled $33.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $3.0 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $30.1 billion.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 5\n\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe engage in R&D activities across the business directed toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as bringing about a significant improvement to existing products and services, and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We also continue to invest and develop a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $643 million of R&D expense.\nIn OFSE, we continue to fund a range of formation evaluation, drilling, completions, and production capabilities and products.

This includes our Orbit 60 Bently Nevada product for critical asset monitoring in turbine systems, including wind, hydro, and gas turbines. The IET segment is also enhancing its process and safety valve business bringing new digital applications including analytics to our customers. Investments in Industrial Technology also include technologies to measure, monitor, and minimize carbon emissions, new inspection technologies for nondestructive evaluation of materials and structures as well as solutions for industrial asset management.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property (\"IP\") rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our IP rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) and GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) and, in some cases, third parties. In particular, we have an IP cross-license agreement with GE Aerospace and GE Vernova that allows all parties to have continued rights to commercially utilize certain IP of the other pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The IP cross-license remains in place following General Electric exiting its ownership position in us. We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations.\nWe follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that we believe appear to have commercial significance. We believe that maintenance, protection and enforcement of our patents, trademarks, and related IP rights is central to the conduct of our business, and pursue protection of our IP rights against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation worldwide as may be necessary to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 6\n\n\nbe other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete. If we are not able to protect our IP or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected. We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nSEASONALITY\nOur operations can be affected by seasonal events, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:\n•In OFSE, adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months, may impact our operations or our customers' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and/or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. For more information on seasonal and weather conditions, see the \"Operational Risks\" section of Part 1 of Item 1A herein.\n•Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea in OFSE generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\n•Many of our international OFSE customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.\n•Our broader IET businesses typically experience higher customer activity, as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.\nRAW MATERIALS\nWe purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services. The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility. We have seen prices stabilize for ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other raw materials, but availability of nickel based super alloys is constrained. Our procurement teams utilize advanced planning and may enter into strategic agreements with our global suppliers to minimize price impacts and other availability challenges. We anticipate some pricing and fulfillment volatility for certain raw materials, components, and certain logistics lanes to continue through 2025.\nIn addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers. These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\")\nSustainability\nWe believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view ESG as a lever to transform the performance of our Company. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This goal encompasses emissions from our operations (\"Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions\") in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the specific recommendations of the United Nations (\"UN\") Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC.\nWe continue to make progress on emissions reductions. We reported in our 2023 Corporate Sustainability Report a 28.3% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as compared to our 2019 base year. This reduction was primarily due to implementing energy efficiency initiatives, facility consolidation, increasing \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 7\n\n\nelectric power consumption from renewable energy sources, and improvements in our vehicle fleet, among other reasons. We plan to continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing, and generation.

CORE Strengths adds focus to the critical skills (for example Data Analytics, Project Management, Change Management) that will help transform our organization, and JOURNEY is targeted for people leaders to help them transition into their leadership roles. We continue to offer in-person learning opportunities to complement the robust virtual learning catalog with workshops and team development.\nOur formal leadership development programs play a pivotal role in attracting, retaining, and developing talent and increasing the pipeline of talent into and within the organization. As an example, Aspire is a two-year rotational leadership program for recent graduates and early-career employees to grow functional and leadership skills through challenging assignments, learning plans, and global cross-functional projects.\nHealth, Safety, Environment, and Wellness\nHSE is at the core of our culture as we are committed to doing the right thing to protect our employees, customers, the communities where we live and work, and the environment. We take a risk-based approach with \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 9\n\n\nproactive and preventive programs to deliver safe, secure, and sustainable operations. We have established a stringent set of standards which meet or exceed global HSE regulatory requirements.\nOur commitment to HSE starts at the highest levels of our Company and is embedded throughout all layers of the organization. We encourage and empower all employees to take an active role in \"owning\" HSE by stopping work when conditions and/or behaviors are unsafe and reporting observations, near misses, and stop-work events through open reporting channels. Our ambition is to ensure each day we operate without serious injuries, accidents, or harm to the environment. Employees are required to complete recurring HSE training to bring awareness to potential hazards, regulatory obligations and performing activities safely. We offer over 225 HSE courses including foundational training required for all employees, workplace and job-specific training, and human-performance leadership training for managers.\nOur commitment to HSE goes beyond safety alone. Occupational health and wellness is a key competency jointly managed within our HSE and Human Resources (\"HR\") teams. The importance of physical health, ergonomics, preventative health care, and mental wellness cannot be overstated in promoting a healthy, engaged, and productive workplace. We work with our health benefit providers and internal teams to offer employees health and wellness programs, telemedicine access, health screenings, immunizations, fitness reimbursements, and virtual wellness tools.\nIn 2024, the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees was a critical priority. We provided resources and tools to our employees and will continue to annually host numerous events with Baker Hughes leaders and external experts. Our Employee Assistance Program provided employees and their family members direct access to professional coaches for in-the-moment counseling or referrals to community experts and extended care providers to navigate daily life and cope with major life events.\nCommunity Involvement\nBaker Hughes seeks to make a positive impact in the communities where we conduct business around the world. Consistent with our purpose and values, we work to advance environmental quality, educational opportunities, health, and wellness. We benefit our communities through financial contributions, in-kind donations of goods and services, and volunteer projects. The Baker Hughes Foundation makes strategic philanthropic contributions, matches Baker Hughes employee charitable contributions, and awards volunteer recognition grants for outstanding employee community service.\nGovernance\nThe Board believes the purpose of corporate governance is to maximize shareholder value in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity. The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices, which the Board and management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices. The Board periodically reviews these governance practices, Delaware law (the state in which the Company is incorporated), the rules and listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities.\nThe Board monitors and provides oversight over our ESG policies, programs, and practices regarding corporate responsibility and sustainability and plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts. Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our social strategy, policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging as well as pay equity, culture, talent development, succession planning, and executive compensation and benefits. Our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the Company's environmental matters, including monitoring its sustainability strategy and initiatives, the management of employee health, safety, and wellness matters, and oversight of our positions on corporate social responsibilities and public issues of significance, including those related to privacy, digital safety and responsible AI, which affect investors and other key stakeholders. The Audit Committee provides oversight over the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies and processes, including data privacy, AI, and compliance reporting. Our Finance Committee provides oversight of our financial and investment policies and of the Company's principal finance, banking, and treasury matters, including the Company's capital structure (both equity and debt) and the principal terms of related financing transactions and requirements.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 10\n\n\nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATION\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations concerning, among other things, air and water quality, waste management, occupational health and safety, and wildlife and land protection. Environmental regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation or the issuance of judicial or agency opinions or orders, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities, obtain new or updated permits to conduct regulated activities, initiate investigatory and/or remedial measures, apply specific HSE criteria addressing employee protection and/or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.\nOngoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall environmental regulatory compliance obligations, including investigatory and/or remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in investigation and/or remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations and operations of our predecessor companies. In some cases, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we have primary responsibility for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, investigation and/or remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $54 million and $58 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, safety, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising, and marketing of our products. Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries. In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. We are also required to comply with transfer pricing, securities laws, and other statutes and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.\nAs a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February of 2022, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries enacted sanctions against Russia and certain Russian interests. As previously announced on March 19, 2022, we suspended any new investments in our Russia operations, but continued to comply with applicable laws and regulations as we fulfilled existing contractual obligations. As a result, we completed a number of actions during the course of 2022 and 2023 including the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business and suspended substantially all of our remaining operational activities in Russia. In 2024, our focus in Russia has been to continue to close local entities within the scope of western sanctions and \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 11\n\n\nlocal regulation. We are continuing to closely monitor the developments in Ukraine and Russia and changes to sanctions all of which continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. For further information see \"Note 20. Restructuring, Impairment and Other\" and \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.\nWe are also subject to laws relating to data privacy and security and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments worldwide have established laws and regulations, and industry groups also have promoted various standards, regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices.\nWhile there are no current environmental or regulatory matters that we expect to have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations, financial position or cash flows or our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other laws, regulations and standards, judicial or administrative opinions or orders applicable to our operations or products will not lead to such a material adverse impact.\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\"), are made available free of charge on our internet website at www.bakerhughes.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, and can be found at their internet website www.sec.gov.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in the Company, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial. Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in the Company.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Our investments in new technologies, equipment, and facilities may not provide competitive returns.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing our products and services and securing equipment across our portfolio. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must provide new and differentiating technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers.\nWe continue to invest in new technologies, equipment, and facilities and to expand our capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of a net-zero future. These efforts include expanding into new energy areas such as geothermal and carbon capture, utilization and storage, strengthening our digital architecture and addressing key energy market themes. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry's capacity relative to customer demand, on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors' products and services and to provide innovative and competitive products and services to meet our client's evolving needs with respect to new energy areas. Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive and innovative technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 14\n\n\nresponse to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, or as a result of the energy transition to lower carbon emitting technology, or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, any competitive advantage that we may hold, and in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have, and may in the future enter into, agreements with third parties to jointly develop certain technologies which may include financial or other commitments. Under the terms of these agreements, we may agree to share in the associated development and marketing costs for the developed technologies. There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop these technologies in collaboration with these third parties that will adequately meet our customers' needs. Also, there can be no assurances that these joint development agreements will be commercially viable, successful or profitable. As a result, these joint development agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe potential transition risks posed by moving to a lower carbon economy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services.\nThere is increased focus by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy will likely require extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes.\nThese changes may result in the enactment of climate change-related regulations, judicial or administrative opinions, orders, policies and initiatives (at the government, regulator, corporate and/or investor community levels); technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy; increased availability of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas and development of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services as well as more efficient products and services.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy and the pace at which the energy transition unfolds. Our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional innovative technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as geothermal, CCUS, hydrogen energy, and other integrated solutions. If the energy transition occurs faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition, or if we are unable to execute our energy transition strategy as planned, demand for our technologies and services or access to capital could be adversely affected. If the energy transition occurs slower than anticipated, we could be developing technologies and services that are not responsive to the commercial needs of our customers.\nIn addition, negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital.\nDisruptions in our supply chain, the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, equipment, and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity, including labor, available to meet our manufacturing plans on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories. Additional disruptions within our supply chain resulting from factors including, but not limited to, pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and shortages in labor supply, have had and may continue to have an impact on our business and reputation. Many of the raw materials essential to our business require the use of rail, storage, and trucking services to transport the materials to our job sites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of or otherwise constrain our supply of raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials and transportation providers used in our business, and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. As a result of these or any other factors, our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 15\n\n\nand revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over-supply of raw materials and component parts, could be adversely affected.\nThe partial or complete loss of GE Vernova or GE Aerospace as suppliers, as well as contracts with our aeroderivative joint venture (the \"Aero JV\") with GE Vernova may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently have extensive commercial relationships with GE Vernova and GE Aerospace. Although we have long-term contractual frameworks in place with both GE Vernova and GE Aerospace, if either GE Vernova or GE Aerospace were to discontinue or reduce their business with the Company, fail to perform their obligations under existing contracts (such as our long-term supply agreement for heavy-duty gas turbines, the Second Amended and Restated Supply and Technology Development Agreement or the related intellectual property agreements with GE Aerospace) or experience disruptions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our contracts and arrangements with GE Aerospace and GE Vernova as direct suppliers, we also have exposure to GE Aerospace and GE Vernova through the Aero JV. The Aero JV is jointly controlled by GE Vernova and us, and as a result, realizing the benefits of this joint venture depends on the continued cooperation between the parties. In addition, the business and financial performance of the Aero JV may be adversely affected if GE Aerospace fails to perform its obligations under its contracts with the Aero JV. We in turn use certain products and services purchased through the Aero JV for the manufacture and maintenance of various end products, and therefore, failure of the Aero JV to perform for any reason could prevent us from fulfilling our contractual obligations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations and future success depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain key personnel. People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing, and delivering our products and providing technical services and solutions to our customers around the world. A competent, well-trained, highly skilled, motivated, and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key employees, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base, could have an adverse impact on our business performance, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change as we restructure the Company, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company, and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include: employee morale, our brand reputation as an employer of choice, competition from other employers, our location strategy for key roles, investments in technology and systems, and availability of qualified individuals with the desired skills and experiences needed to grow our business. Other factors that have, and could continue to impact our workforce, are: changes to our office environments and the impact this could have on our Company culture, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely, which may not meet the expectations of our employees.\nThe implementation of our plan to restructure our corporate organization and operating segments may not achieve the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time the Company will embark upon restructuring activities, whether in response to business operating cycles or for more significant programs of strategic significance (for example the corporate realignment in 2022 which resulted in a focus on our two operating segments). Restructuring activities may be more costly than anticipated, and could lead to the diversion of management's attention from other business priorities. As a result of these or any other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits associated with the restructuring plan. There can be no assurance that the restructuring plan will materially increase our profitability. Even if the restructuring plan generates the benefits that we have anticipated, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that occur as a result of the restructuring, which could adversely affect our business.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 16\n\n\nOur business could be impacted by both geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict, in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest and/or government expropriations.\nGeopolitical and terrorism threats continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business. Geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict among countries, has had and could in the future lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, adverse impact to our employees, and impairment of our or our customers' ability to conduct operations.\nFurther, the broader consequences of geopolitical and terrorism threats, which may include further sanctions that prohibit our ability to do business in specific countries, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, the potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and the extent of any such threats effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\nCertain geopolitical conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, have had and may continue to have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in our public filings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on regional and global macroeconomic conditions; increased volatility in the price and demand of oil and natural gas, increased exposure to cyber-attacks; limitations in our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; risks to employees and contractors that we have in the region; disruptions in global supply chains; exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; potential nationalizations and assets seizures; constraints or disruption in the capital markets and our sources of liquidity; our potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation. Any such risks may require us to record asset impairments and experience adverse operating impacts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by national oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.\nMuch of the world's oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by national oil companies. National oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with national oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\nOur operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers' costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries, such as the offshore oilfield business. These hazards include blowouts, explosions, unplanned or uncontrolled releases, nuclear-related events, fires, collisions, capsizings, and severe weather conditions. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event, against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSeasonal and weather conditions, including severe weather associated with climate change, could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme winter conditions in Canada or the North Sea, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Further, the physical risks of climate change can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g. flooding, \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 17\n\n\nhurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g. drought, desertification, or poor water quality). Such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results, particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity, and could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may include evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, weather-related damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations, weather-related damage to our facilities and project work sites, inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules, decreases in demand for oil and natural gas during unseasonably warm winters, and loss of productivity. As a result of the above repercussions or any others, demand for our services and operations may be adversely affected.\nWhile we evaluate and incorporate potential ranges of physical risks, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business has previously and may in the future again be adversely affected by a public health emergency or outbreak of a contagious disease or virus.\nIn the past, the markets have experienced volatility in oil demand due to the economic impacts of public health emergencies. If demand for our products and services decline as a result of a public health emergency, the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could decline. The spread of a pandemic could result in instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in adverse impacts on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases and measures to contain the disease may adversely impact our workforce and operations, operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. The extent to which these public health emergencies adversely impact our business would depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending on the severity and duration of the emergency and effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such containment or mitigation measures and potential future measures which may result in labor disruptions, employee attrition, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCREDIT AND CUSTOMER CONTRACTING RISKS\nProviding services on an integrated, turnkey, or fixed price basis could require us to assume additional risks.\nWe may choose to enter into integrated or turnkey contracts with our customers that require us to provide services and equipment outside of our core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may also subject us to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling operations, project management interface risk, and risks associated with subcontracting and consortium arrangements. These integrated or turnkey contracts may be fixed price contracts that do not allow us to recover for cost over-runs unless they are directly caused by the customer.\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements.\nOur products are used in deepwater, and other harsh environments, and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. In addition, scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry and LNG industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications. We cannot provide assurance that our products, including products supplied through joint ventures, will be able to satisfy the specifications necessary in all scenarios or under all operating conditions, nor that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing required to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 18\n\n\ncontract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects, which could impose additional costs and obligations on us.\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes.\nOur contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances.\nOur contracts with customers generally may be terminated by the customer for convenience, default, or extended force majeure (which could include inability to perform due to a pandemic or as a result of civil unrest or armed conflicts). Termination for convenience may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer, but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Termination by the customer for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the customer to pay an early termination fee.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our customers terminate some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated. Our RPO is comprised of unfulfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services). The actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported RPO. The total dollar amount of the Company's RPO as of December 31, 2024 was $33.1 billion.\nThe credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses.\nHaving a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect, timely or at all, from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nOur customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow, financial condition and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.\nOur customers' access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments, and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow. In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses or resulting in us collecting substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 19\n\n\nGross receivables related to our primary customer in Mexico were 7%, 9%, and 10% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition to the potential risk of credit loss related to collection of accounts receivable with this customer, we have and may in the future, issue credit default swaps (\"CDS\") to third-party institutions related to borrowings to this customer who utilizes these funds to repay certain of our receivables. In the event of default by our customer to the financial institution, we would be required to pay the notional amount outstanding under the CDS, which may adversely impact our results of operations, short-term liquidity position, and cash flows.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. In particular, goods, services, data, finances, people, and technology that cross international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions.\nCompliance-related issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries, impact our earnings and cash flows, bring reputational harm, or result in governmental investigations leading to fines, penalties or other remedial measures. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations, and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, currency conversion, repatriation of income or capital, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate. In addition, changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate, including changes in administration, can have a material effect on the laws, rules, and regulations that affect our operations and liquidity. Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. The continued success of our global business and operations depends, in part, on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political, legal and regulatory risks. Given the highly dynamic nature of these restrictions and the unprecedented nature of these changes in recent years, and the uncertainty in the political landscape and unrest in certain areas of the world, our future success depends on the ability of our organization to react to such changes rapidly and appropriately to assure compliance as we continue to conduct business globally.\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to successfully manage our agents, distributors and other business partners, and supervise, train, and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and reputational harm in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us.\nNon-compliance with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing and various other financial laws may subject us to sanctions, civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and potential reputational harm. While we strive to continuously improve our programs and pursue effective compliance, we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 20\n\n\nChanges to tax laws and associated positions (including tax rate and adverse positions taken by taxing authorities) and international trade policy (including the imposition of tariffs and other import and export regulations) in the countries where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to changes in tax laws, rates, treaties, and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate, any of which, including in the interpretation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the examinations and subsequent tax assessments by various tax authorities could increase the Company's tax liabilities. Any changes to tax laws or rates or unfavorable positions taken by tax authorities have and could preclude our ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits which could increase the amount of valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are subject to changes to the U.S. and foreign country tariffs, international trade agreements and policies. Expansion of trade restrictions, changes to government policies related to tariffs or trade agreements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be subject to litigation and environmental claims arising out of our products and services which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks and we are from time to time subject to litigation in the U.S. and in foreign countries, for example claims involving services or equipment such as personal injury or loss of life, product failure (including as a result of a cyber-attack) or damage to or destruction of property, employment and labor, customer privacy, or regulatory risks. While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, our insurance may not cover all expenses related to litigation claims arising from our business. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. We may therefore incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe and our business are subject to extensive domestic and international environmental, health and safety regulations. In addition to environmental, health and safety regulatory compliance obligations, we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury, property damage, and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous substances or operations at our current or former facilities. Additionally, we may be impacted by material changes in environmental, health and safety regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts caused by our (or our predecessors') operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and associated expenditures, including but not limited to our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are forecasted and may be inconsistent based on multiple variables. Our compliance cost forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose new or increased restrictions on air or other emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; changes in standards of enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected, adverse \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 21\n\n\noutcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\"), (including Superfund sites, the allocation of PRP liability at other sites, or discovery of additional issues at existing sites) where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental, unauthorized discharge of hazardous materials.\nInvestor and public perception related to the Company's ESG performance as well as current and future ESG reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results.\nIn recent years, companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders, including investor advocacy groups, proxy advisory firms, certain institutional investors and lenders, investment funds and other influential investors and rating agencies, related to their ESG and sustainability practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards on ESG matters (or meet sustainability goals and targets that we have set), as they continue to evolve, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately or quickly enough to growing concern for ESG and sustainability issues, regardless of whether there is a regulatory or legal requirement to do so, we may face increased litigation risk, reputational damage and our business, financial condition and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on the implementation of our ESG strategy, including our emissions reduction commitments, may also create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal and other risks. While we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, some of the statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nOur voluntary disclosures of ESG data are evaluated and rated by various organizations that assess corporate ESG performance. These organizations provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters and have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or our inability to meet the ESG standards set by specific investors, may lead to negative investor sentiment and reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact, among other things, on our stock price and cost of capital.\nRegulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the European Union, Australia, and the State of California. These regulations will require the reporting of sustainability data, including greenhouse gas emissions. We expect regulatory disclosure requirements related to sustainability matters to continue to expand globally, which has and may continue to increase our cost and burden of compliance and may subject us to potential legal and reputational risk.\nTo achieve our stated emission reduction goals, we have implemented internal decarbonization projects and may also need to rely on external factors, such as the greater deployment of carbon reduction and removal technologies and adoption of government policies that we expect would accelerate the adoption of energy transition technologies. There have been policy responses to support the energy transition in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, geopolitical instability has increased energy prices compared to the prior year and raised energy security concerns, which may result in many governments reassessing energy transition strategies, extending the timeline to ensure adequate and reasonably priced energy supplies. It is difficult to predict with certainty how these policy, economic, and energy security issues will impact the energy transition. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our reductions and elimination of carbon equivalent emissions commitments within the timelines we announce, or changes to these commitments or related timelines could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating our approach to ESG matters, our stock price and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 22\n\n\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on reducing GHG emissions. Compliance with GHG emission regulations applicable to our or our customers' operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossil-fuel sectors.\nIn the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA released a final rule expanding the scope of the reporting rule, effective January 1, 2025, which in turn may impact (and include) data from our equipment or operations to the extent it remains in effect under the new administration. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and natural gas and power industries. International developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol by the signatories; the Glasgow Climate Pact; the EU Emission Trading System; Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdom's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting framework; and the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism. Caps or fees on carbon emissions, including in the U.S. (such as methane fees imposed on emissions from certain oil and gas facilities under the Inflation Reduction Act), have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel sectors. Newly enacted GHG emissions requirements have been subject to ongoing legal challenges in the U.S. which may delay the implementation or enforcement of such rules. Although a reduction in GHG reporting obligations in the U.S. may be possible at the federal level in the short-term with changing administrations, long-term regulatory trends suggest that federal regulation of GHG emissions is likely to increase over time. The implementation of these agreements and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions or impose taxes on us or our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While the Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo to overrule Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which ended the concept of general deference to regulatory agency interpretations of laws, introduces new complexity for federal agencies and administration of climate change policy and regulatory programs, many of these initiatives may continue. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to address climate change or reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVoluntary initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, as well as increased climate change awareness, may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\nThere are various corporate and non-governmental initiatives that are focused on voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may shift demand from oil and natural gas towards an investment in relatively lower carbon emitting energy sources and alternative energy solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security, may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations or customer-imposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations are and may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn the U.S., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, regulations and standards concerning personal information, privacy and data security. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 23\n\n\nindividual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. Internationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information or other data. For example, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals located in the European Economic Area and the U.K. is subject to strict regulations, and compliance may require adhering to stringent legal and operational obligations and the dedication of substantial time and financial resources.\nThe various and evolving federal, state and international laws, regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and, given our global footprint, this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs, such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or international laws, regulations, standards, or contractual or other obligations, relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies, customers or individuals, which could subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS\nAn inability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate. Our applications for intellectual property rights may not be granted entirely, as to key features, or at all. Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. The weakening of protection of our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized. Without protection for the intellectual property rights we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products. Also, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms. We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property.\nIncreased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our systems, data and business, and our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may hold or have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us, our employees or third parties, including customers, partners or suppliers. Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' systems, data, and business, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our and our employees' and customers' data. We utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate our exposure including maintaining a dedicated Cyber Fusion Center (\"CFC\") and engaging third party experts. For more information see the \"Risk Management & Strategy\" section of Part 1 of Item 1C herein. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security incidents, including ransomware incidents. Given our global footprint, the large number of customers, partners, suppliers and service providers with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber-attacks, an incident could occur and persist for an extended period without detection. Any investigation of a cyber-attack or other security incident would be inherently \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 24\n\n\nunpredictable, and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and the availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an incident. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any cyber-attacks and other security incidents. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to our own systems, we use third-party service providers, who in turn may also use third-party providers, to process certain data or information on our behalf. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers or other third parties to the extent affecting information we share with them. Although we contractually require these third parties to implement and maintain reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems.\nOur digital technologies and services, as well as third-party products, services and technologies on which we rely (including emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence programs), are subject to the risk of cyberattacks. Despite our and our service providers' efforts to protect our data and information, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks occur. In the normal conduct of our business, we and our service providers have been and may in the future be vulnerable to security breaches, ransomware attacks, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, employee errors and/or malfeasance or similar events, including those perpetrated by criminals or nation-state actors, that could potentially lead to the compromise, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of data or information, improper use of our systems, defective products, loss of access to our data, production downtimes and operational disruptions; and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents may remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. In addition, a cyber-attack or any other significant compromise or breach of our data security, media reports about such an incident, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, harm to our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties, distraction to our management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines and penalties. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors become increasingly sophisticated in techniques and tools (including artificial intelligence) that circumvent controls, evade detection and even remove forensic evidence of the infiltration. Given the increased prevalence of customer-imposed connectivity, cybersecurity controls and other related contractual obligations towards customers or other third parties, there are an increased number of attack vectors and a cyber-attack or other security incident also could result in breach of contract or indemnity claims against us by customers or other counterparties.\nWhile we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches or attacks, failures or other data security-related incidents, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 25\n\n\nINDUSTRY AND MARKET RISKS\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPrices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis. As a result, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nDemand for our products and services is subject to factors beyond our control and depends substantially on expenditures by our customers. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers' spending levels and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Across our products and services, customer demand may be reduced due to global economic factors beyond our control, including but not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and declining availability of credit. Specifically, for example, past oil and natural gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which in the past has resulted, and may in the future result, in a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices that may require us to record asset impairments, and we could experience decreased revenue, decreased profitability and reduction in cash flows. Such potential impairment charges and adverse operating metrics could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers' decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells.\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business and create volatility, as well as the costs of doing business of our customers.\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general may affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. Actions by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs or make the cost of borrowing funds commercially unattractive. Furthermore, if our credit rating is downgraded, it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and issuances of commercial paper, as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew, obtain, or issue new debt financing.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, our shareholders may be unable to sell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure our shareholders that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include: variations in our quarterly operating \nBaker Hughes Company 2024 Form 10-K | 26\n\n\nresults; failure to meet our earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or our industry; additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by shareholders; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and general market and economic conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that might be considered favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable by permitting the Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, and placing limitations on convening shareholder meetings. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals, delay, or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nThis exclusive forum provision applies to certain state law claims and will not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. In addition, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.",
