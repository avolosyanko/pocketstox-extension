Equity capital is assigned to each segment based primarily on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate & Other segment.\nNet interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segments to the extent the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, number of transactions processed for loans and deposits, and average loan and deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment.\nLending Activities\nGeneral\nThrough WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of lending products to customers, including the loan types discussed below. \nCommercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans comprise 43% and 38% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These loans include working capital lines of credit, loans to technology companies, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, and other commercial loans. Equipment loans and leases and loans to tax-exempt municipalities and not-for-profit organizations are also categorized as commercial and industrial loans. \nResidential: Residential loans comprise 27% and 29% of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company executes flow and bulk residential loan purchases that meet the Company's goals and underwriting criteria through its residential mortgage acquisition program. These loan purchases consist of both conforming and non-conforming loans. Non-conforming loan purchases are generally limited to borrowers with high FICO scores and loans with low loan-to-value ratios. \nCRE: Loans to fund the purchase or refinancing of CRE for investors (non-owner occupied) or owner occupants represent 22% and 23% of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. Approximately $2.3 billion, or 4.4%, of total loans HFI consisted of CRE non-owner occupied office loans as of December 31, 2024, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.7%, as of December 31, 2023. These office loans primarily consist of shorter-term bridge loans that enable borrowers to reposition or redevelop projects with more modern standards attractive to in-office employers in today’s environment, including enhanced on-site amenities. The vast majority of these projects are located in suburban locations with central business district and midtown exposure of less than 1% and 11% of office loans, respectively. \nThe office loan portfolio largely consists of value-add loans that require significant up-front cash equity contributions from institutional sponsors and large regional and national developers. The properties underlying these loans have stable business trends and low vacancy rates. In addition to adhering to conservative underwriting standards, asset-specific credit risk is mitigated through continued sponsor support of projects by re-appraisal rights by the Company, re-margining requirements and ongoing debt service, and debt yield covenants. To a large extent, the financing structures of these loans do not carry junior liens or mezzanine debt, which enables maximum flexibility when working with clients and sponsors.\nSubstantially all of the Company's remaining CRE loans are secured by first liens with an initial loan-to-value ratio of generally not more than 75%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 16% of the Company's CRE loans were owner occupied. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property.\nConstruction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans comprise 8% and 10% of the Company's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This portfolio includes single family and multi-family residential projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, medical office facilities, and residential lot developments. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local and national developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to \ndetermine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years.\nConsumer: Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Examples of these consumer loans include home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, personal lines of credit, and loans to individuals for investment purposes. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company's HFI loan portfolio totaled $53.7 billion, or approximately 66% of total assets. The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's HFI loan portfolio: \n\n                                                                                                                                                    December 31,\n                                                                                                    2024                                                    2023\n                                                                       Amount                    Percent                       Amount                    Percent\n                                                                                                                                           (dollars in millions)\nCommercial and industrial                                        $23,128                       43.1    %                 $19,103                       38.0    %\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied                        9,868                       18.4                        9,650                       19.2     \nCommercial real estate - owner occupied                            1,825                        3.4                        1,810                        3.6     \nConstruction and land development                                  4,479                        8.3                        4,889                        9.7     \nResidential real estate                                           14,326                       26.7                       14,778                       29.4     \nConsumer                                                              50                        0.1                           67                        0.1     \nLoans HFI, net of deferred loan fees and costs                   $53,676                      100.0    %                 $50,297                      100.0    %\nAllowance for credit losses                                        (374)                                                   (337)                                \nNet loans HFI                                                    $53,302                                                 $49,960                                \nFor additional information regarding loans, see \"Note 4. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses\" in Item 8 or \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations and Financial Condition – Loans\" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards intended to ensure appropriate management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards.\nLoan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, collateral analysis, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The BOD approves all material changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. The Bank's lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions in which the Bank operates, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. The Bank's credit culture emphasizes timely identification of troubled credits allowing management to take prompt corrective action, when necessary.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority\nThe Company's loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows:\n•Individual Credit Authorities. The credit approval levels for individual credit officers are set by policy and certain credit officers' approval authorities are established on a delegated basis. \n•SLC Subcommittees. Credits in excess of individual credit authorities but less than SLC approval thresholds are submitted to the appropriate subcommittee based on risk segment. The Company's risk segments are defined primarily by product lines organized based on loan type and risk profile. The subcommittees consist of members of the Bank's senior management and senior credit officers. \n•SLC. Credits in excess of subcommittee approval authority require the approval of the Bank's SLC, which has the highest level of credit approval authority. SLC membership includes the CEO and other senior executives appointed by the CEO and is chaired by the Bank's CCO. \nManagement and monitoring of credit risk for the Company's overall lending portfolio continues to be a high priority. As elevated focus on the evolving industry dynamics facing the CRE market have emerged over the past year, the Company has been proactive in establishing enhanced monitoring policies and procedures as it relates to its CRE loans and has undertaken actions to limit growth of its CRE portfolio. To this end, and to drive consistency in underwriting, portfolio management, and loan monitoring metrics, in January 2024, the Company aligned its loan committee structures to a product focus, creating new CRE and C&I loan committees, which is a shift away from its former divisional or NBL focused loan committees. The Company has also undertaken efforts during the year to streamline its credit risk monitoring process to enable management to more centrally track and monitor assets. In addition, the Company's credit monitoring strategy continues to be focused on early identification and elevation of potential problem loans. These efforts include increased frequency of meetings with business line owners, early engagement of the Company's special assets group, and inclusion of pass grade loans with a potential for downgrade in asset quality and problem loan meeting discussions.\nLoans to One Borrower. In addition to the limits set forth below, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20% of the Bank’s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Arizona law does not specifically require aggregation of loans to affiliated entities in determining compliance with the lending limit. As a matter of longstanding practice, the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions uses the same aggregation analysis as applied to national banks by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk. The Company's lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits for its HFI and HFS loan portfolios, which are based on outstanding amounts, to control single customer and product exposures. The Company's lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures based on outstanding amounts as of December 31, 2024:\n\n                                                                          Percent of Tier 1 Capital and ACL (1)\n                                                         Policy Limit                                    Actual\nLoans HFI                                                                                                      \nCRE                                                        230      %                                165      %\nCommercial and industrial                                  550                                       327       \nConstruction and land development                           85                                        63       \nResidential real estate                                    260                                       202       \nConsumer                                                     7                                         1       \nLoans HFS                                                                                                      \nResidential real estate                                     60                                        32       \n(1)    ACL refers to the allowance for credit losses on funded loans.\nAsset Quality\nGeneral\nTo measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered satisfactory \"pass\" ratings. The other four \"non-pass\" grades range from a “Special mention” category to a “Loss” category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made and formally reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the Company's loan grade certification process to identify loans that may be exhibiting early-warning signs of credit stress and determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of the Company's loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal loan review department.\nCollection Procedure\nBank personnel are responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts, and loan agreement covenant defaults related to its commercial borrowers. If a commercial borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contact is generally made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank also maintains a special assets department, which generally services and collects loans rated Substandard or worse. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged-off.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest (that are not government guaranteed), non-accrual and accruing restructured loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the Company determines ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. In addition, the Company considers all loans rated Substandard or worse to be experiencing financial difficulty. A restructured loan is a loan modification for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Other repossessed assets result from loans where the Company has received title or physical possession of the borrower’s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent non-residential loans with balances greater than $0.5 million every 12 months. Total net gains and losses on sales and reappraisals of repossessed and other assets was not significant during each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. However, losses may be experienced in future periods.\nCriticized Assets\nFederal bank regulators require banks to classify their assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade of \"Special Mention\" from the Company's internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of \"Substandard,\" \"Doubtful,\" and \"Loss\" are utilized to identify actual problem assets.\nThe following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the Company's internal loan grading system definitions:\n•\"Special Mention\" (Grade 6): Generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a “problem loan” where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants.\n•“Substandard” (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual status are considered at least \"Substandard,\" unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise.\n•“Doubtful” (Grade 8): These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as \"Substandard\" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined.\n•“Loss” (Grade 9): These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans, unfunded loan commitments, and investment securities. The provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the ACL at a level adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the ACL and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the ACL. The ACL on funded loans and investment securities are presented as a reduction to the respective asset balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments is classified in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s methodology see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition – Critical Accounting Estimates – Allowance for Credit Losses” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nInvestment Activities\nThe Company has an investment policy, which is approved by the BOD on an annual basis. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company's interest rate risk management. The Bank’s ALCO is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The CFO and Treasurer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specified guidelines. All investment transactions for the Bank and for the holding company during the year ended December 31, 2024 were reviewed by the ALCO and BOD. \nThe Company's investment policy limits new securities purchases to certain eligible investment types and, in the aggregate, are further subject to the following quantitative limits of the Bank, which are calculated as a percent of CET1, as of December 31, 2024: \n\nSecurities Category                                                                                      Policy Limit                  Actual\nHeld-to-maturity                                                                                                                             \nTax-exempt low income housing development bonds                                                           35.0      %               19.9    %\nAvailable-for-sale debt and equity securities                                                                                                \nCLO                                                                                                       22.5                       8.4     \nCorporate debt securities                                                                                 10.0                       6.0     \nHigh quality liquid assets:                                                                                                                  \nNon‐GNMA                                                                                                  70.0                      36.4     \nGNMA                                                                                                      92.5                      61.7     \nPrivate label residential MBS                                                                             25.0                      16.9     \nMunicipal securities and tax-exempt low income housing development bonds                                  20.0                      13.9     \nU.S. Treasury securities &amp; agency notes with maturities greater than 1 year (1)                       50.0                         —     \nCRA                                                                                                        5.0                       1.0     \nPreferred stock                                                                                            5.0                       1.4     \n(1)    There is no investment policy limit for purchases of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities less than 1 year.\nThe Company's policies also govern the use of derivatives, and provide that the Company prudently use derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations as a risk management tool to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk, and not for speculative purposes.\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as AFS or HTM pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments and ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments. Equity securities are reported at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 321, Equity Securities. For further discussion of significant accounting policies related to the Company's investment securities portfolio refer to \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's investment securities portfolio totaled $15.1 billion, representing approximately 19% of the Company's total assets, with a significant portion of the portfolio invested in AAA/AA+ rated securities. The average duration, which is a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's debt securities portfolio, is 3.4 years as of December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's investment securities:\n\n                                                                                                                                     December 31,\n                                                                                     2024                                                    2023\n                                                        Amount                    Percent                       Amount                    Percent\n                                                                                                                            (dollars in millions)\nDebt securities                                                                                                                                  \nResidential MBS issued by GSEs                     $5,831                       38.6    %                  $1,972                       15.5    %\nU.S. Treasury securities                            4,383                       29.0                        4,853                       38.2     \nTax-exempt                                          2,195                       14.5                        2,101                       16.5     \nPrivate label residential MBS                       1,123                        7.4                        1,303                       10.2     \nCLO                                                   570                        3.8                        1,399                       11.0     \nCommercial MBS issued by GSEs                         437                        2.9                          530                        4.2     \nCorporate debt securities                             386                        2.6                          367                        2.9     \nOther                                                  69                        0.4                           69                        0.5     \nTotal debt securities                             $14,994                       99.2    %                 $12,594                       99.0    %\nEquity securities                                                                                                                                \nPreferred stock                                       $91                        0.6    %                    $100                        0.8    %\nCRA investments                                        26                        0.2                           26                        0.2     \nTotal equity securities                              $117                        0.8    %                    $126                        1.0    %\nTotal investment securities                       $15,111                      100.0    %                 $12,720                      100.0    %\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also held investments in BOLI of $1.0 billion and $186 million, respectively. BOLI is used as a tax efficient method to help offset employee benefit costs. The increase in BOLI from December 31, 2023 is attributable to the purchase of a new BOLI policy during the year. The earnings from the new BOLI separate life policy are linked to the performance of a pool of highly rated (AA or better) CLO securities, secured by a stable value wrap that provides a level of stability to the investment performance of the underlying CLO portfolio.\nFor additional information concerning investments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations and Financial Condition – Investments” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. \nDeposit Products\nThe Company offers a variety of deposit products, including demand deposits, checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. Recently, the Company has also focused on expanding into new deposit channels, including online consumer focused deposit initiatives. As of December 31, 2024, the deposit portfolio was comprised of 28% non-interest-bearing deposits and 72% interest-bearing deposits.\nThe competition for deposits in the Company's markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including its:\n•knowledgeable and empowered bankers committed to providing personalized and responsive service that translates into long lasting relationships; \n•broad selection of cash management services offered; and \n•incentives to employees for business development and retention. \nDeposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, competitiveness of offered rates, perceived stability of financial institutions, and competition. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of its customers.\nThe Bank's deposit rates are determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including:\n•current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates;\n•competition for deposits;\n•loan and deposit positions and forecasts, including any concentrations in either; and\n•alternative borrowing costs from the FHLB or other sources.\nThe following table shows the Company's deposit composition: \n\n                                                                                                                                                 December 31,\n                                                      2024                                                                                               2023\n                                                                       Amount                    Percent                    Amount                    Percent\n                                                                                                                                                (in millions)\nNon-interest-bearing demand deposits                             $18,846                       28.4    %              $14,520                       26.2    %\nInterest-bearing transaction accounts                             15,878                       23.9                    15,916                       28.8     \nSavings and money market accounts                                 21,208                       32.0                    14,791                       26.7     \nTime certificates of deposit ($250,000 or more)                    1,640                        2.5                     1,478                        2.7     \nOther time deposits (1)                                            8,769                       13.2                     8,628                       15.6     \nTotal deposits                                                   $66,341                      100.0    %              $55,333                      100.0    %\n(1)    Retail brokered time deposits over $250,000 of $5.6 billion and $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included within Other time deposits as these deposits are generally participated out by brokers in shares below the FDIC insurance limit.\nAlthough the Company does not pay interest to depositors of non-interest-bearing accounts, earnings credits and referral fees are awarded to certain account holders, which offset charges incurred by account holders for other services. Earnings credits and referral fees earned in excess of charges incurred by account holders are recorded in Deposit costs as part of non-interest expense and fluctuate as a result of eligible deposit balances and ECR rates on these deposit balances. \nIn addition to the Company's deposit base, it has access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and secured and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, the Company has also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, credit linked note, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning the Company's deposits, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Balance Sheet Analysis – Deposits” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. \nOther Financial Products and Services\nIn addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment and presentment, funds transfer and other digital payment offerings, lock box services, courier, and cash management services.\nCustomer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations\nCommercial and industrial loans make up 43% and 38% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Residential loans comprise 27% and 29% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, 30% and 33% of the Company's HFI loan portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was represented by CRE and construction and land development loans. The Company’s CRE business is concentrated primarily in the Company's core footprint states: Arizona, California, and Nevada. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. \nThe Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments have customer relationships that individually account for 10% or more of consolidated or segment revenues. No material portion of the Company’s lending business is seasonal. However, seasonality in the Company's mortgage warehouse deposits may impact lending activities.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive and has been significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial technology firms, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers. In addition, many of the Company's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization and are able to offer a broader range of financial services than the Company can offer. Technological innovation and capabilities, including changes in product delivery systems and web-based tools, also continue to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets and larger competitors may be able to allocate more resources to these technology initiatives.\nHuman Capital Resources\nThe Company’s culture is defined by its corporate values of integrity, creativity, teamwork, passion, and excellence. People, Performance, and Possibilities capture the Company's defining values and behaviors that shape our unique culture and how we do business. People are the foundation of the Company and the Company invests in their success by providing expanded opportunities for career growth and advancement. Our people are committed to our clients’ success and, by putting clients first, we create strong stockholder returns. This leads to tremendous possibilities to fuel client growth and support the Company’s communities.\nThe Company is deeply committed to giving back to the communities where it does business and strives to help low-to-moderate income geographies become healthier and more sustainable communities. Employees are encouraged to dedicate their time and expertise to charitable and civic organizations they are passionate about. In total, employees volunteered more than 18,000 hours in 2024. The Company is also committed to providing financial support for education, affordable housing, and community development lending and investments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company employed 3,524 full-time equivalent employees, an increase of 8% from December 31, 2023. The Company’s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. \nHuman Capital Metrics\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a dynamic and diverse workforce and provides equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. The Company continually assesses opportunities to attract and retain a diverse population of high performing employees to support the growth of the Company. The Company has built relationships with community and educational institutions to strengthen its pipelines of potential job candidates. The Company maintains an executive-led Opportunity Council, which provides access to leadership, and evaluates organizational practices that build a sense of belonging, enhance the Company's pipeline of talent, engage its people, and create a culture instilled with the Company's corporate values. One aspect of this work is the active support of Business Resource Groups, which are employee-led groups to support the diverse aspects and experiences of our people, such as women, veterans, minority groups, cancer survivors and caretakers, LGBTQIA+ employees, employees with disabilities, and encouraging multigenerational connections. These groups are open to all, provide connection with Bank leadership, and are focused on education, professional development, and community engagement.\nThe Company employs a diverse workforce that reflects its clients and communities, which is shown in the Company's ethnic and gender diversity metrics presented in the table below: \n\n                                                                                                                           December 31,\n                                                                       2024                          2023                          2022\n                                                                                                   (as a percentage of total employees)\nEmployees belonging to an ethnic minority group                     45    %                       44    %                       43    %\nFemale employees                                                    50                            51                            52     \nAs of December 31, 2024, 44% of employees that occupied roles involving supervision and management of other employees were women, compared to 43% in the prior year. In addition, at the leadership level, the Company's female and ethnic employees increased to 48% as of December 31, 2024 from 45% in the prior year.\nRecruiting, Retention, and Talent Development\nThe Company recognizes its success is highly dependent on its ability to attract, retain and develop employees. To foster this development, the Company has created three early talent identification programs, a college internship program, the CBDP, and iLead, with the goal of each program being to enhance management’s ability to promote pathways for growth of future leaders. Campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships also help expand the Company’s pipeline of talent. Within the internship program, college students and recent graduates are paired with leaders across the Company to create a valuable, immersive experience, with an objective of retaining promising interns and creating a pipeline for the CBDP or other roles. The CBDP is an 18-month, on-the-job development program to train successful credit analysts that offers progressive assignments, mentoring, opportunities to learn the business and various aspects of leadership, with the objective of developing future leaders of the Company. The iLead Program is an 18-month program for recent MBA graduates, designed to accelerate the development of high potential mid-career talent in sales or corporate career paths. Additionally, the Company has expanded its sales training and mentoring efforts to foster internal development within its commercial lending teams.\nAs a growing company, recruiting new talent to the organization is key to the Company’s success and part of that objective includes building a workforce that is representative of the communities the Company exists in and serves. In 2024, 51% of WAB’s open positions were filled by external candidates belonging to an ethnic minority group compared to 47% in 2023.\n13\n\n\nRetaining qualified employees who have been key contributors to the Company's success story remains an important objective. The table below presents the Company's overall employee turnover rate:\n\n                                                                      Year ended December 31,\n                                   2024                   2023 (1)                   2022 (1)\nTurnover Rate                    15   %                    14    %                    17    %\n(1)Excludes the impact of reductions in workforce during the period.\nThe turnover rate was largely consistent at 15% in 2024 compared to 2023. \nThe table below presents the Company's employee turnover rate by age group: \n\n                                                                                  Year ended December 31,\nTurnover Rate by Age Group                     2024                   2023 (1)                   2022 (1)\nUnder 30                                     19   %                    18    %                    27    %\nBetween 30-50                                                          14                         15     \nOver 50                                                                14                         15     \n(1)Excludes the impact of reductions in workforce during the period.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company's turnover rate was highest among employees in the Under 30 age group. \nThe Company also offers a variety of resources and training to help its employees grow in their current roles and build new skills and awareness, including online development programs and workshops, mentoring programs, tuition reimbursement, participation in Business Resource Groups, and internal webinars that feature speakers from across the Company, sharing information about and success in their business line, division, or functional area. The Company encourages its employees to take an active role in their career and through the annual performance management process, employees are able to identify individual development goals and create an action plan to achieve these goals. \nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company’s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees to deliver strong performance and excellence. In addition to salaries, these programs include annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, healthcare, life insurance and other benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, and various paid time off benefits. Throughout the organization, 100% of employees participate in the annual bonus plan or are eligible to receive business incentives.\nHealth and Wellness\nThe Company is committed to supporting the wellness of its people, to enable their personal and professional productivity, improve physical and mental well-being, and provide support for optimal health at work and at home. To support these efforts, the Company has established Wellness Committees to engage its people in well-being initiatives that provide opportunities for employees to develop healthier lifestyles by promoting habits and attitudes that support wellness.\nSupervision and Regulation\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws. A summary description of the laws and regulations that relate to the Company’s operations are discussed in Supervision and Regulation within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nAdditional Available Information\nThe Company maintains an internet website at http://www.westernalliancebancorporation.com.

      "text": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks, many of which are specific to our business. The discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties, of which we are currently aware, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Other risks that we do not know about now, or that we do not currently believe are material, could negatively impact our business or the trading price of our securities. Additionally, investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized. See additional discussions about credit, interest rate, market, and litigation risks in \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nMarket and Economic Risks\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets, adverse developments or concerns affecting the financial services industry generally or financial institutions that are similar to us or may be viewed as being similar to us, and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, U.S. government debt default or shutdown, the imposition of tariffs on trade, natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, terrorist attacks, acts of war (such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe specific impact on us of unfavorable or uncertain economic or market conditions is difficult to predict, could be long or short term, and may be indirect, such as disruptions in our customers' supply chains or a reduction in the demand for their products or services. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects, including the following:\n•a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services we offer;\n•an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses; \n•a decrease in the value of loans and other assets or in the value of collateral;\n•a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities; \n•an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill; \n•an increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry; and\n•an increase in borrowing costs in excess of changes in the rate at which we reinvest funds.\nIn the U.S. financial services industry, the soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments affecting financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar events, have in the past and may in the future lead to erosion of customer confidence in the banking system or certain banks, deposit volatility, liquidity issues, credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, stock price volatility and other adverse developments. The bank closures in the first half of 2023 led to such disruption and volatility, including deposit outflows, at many mid-sized banks, including us, increasing the need for liquidity. Although bank regulators ensured depositors would have access to all of their money after only one business day of the first such bank closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, it is not certain bank regulators will treat future bank failures similarly. Additionally, these types of events may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms, and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the events described above or other related or similar events, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that the business environment in the U.S., including with respect to the financial services industry, will continue to be challenging or experience recession or additional volatility in the future. There can be no assurance such conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen. There also can be no assurance there will not be additional bank failures or liquidity concerns in particular segments of the financial services industry or in the U.S. financial system as a whole. Such conditions or events could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates and increased rate competition could adversely affect our profitability, business, and prospects.\nMost of our assets and liabilities reprice with changes in interest rates, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net interest income, mortgage banking revenues, the valuation of our assets and liabilities, and our ability to effectively manage interest rate risk. \nWe derive a significant amount of revenue from net interest income and, therefore, our net income depends heavily on net interest margin. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest we receive on loans, securities, and other earning assets and the interest we pay on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, the slope of the interest rate curve, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. In a rising rate environment, the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities may increase more quickly than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities, and other earning assets, which could adversely impact our net interest income and earnings. \nInterest rates rose rapidly during 2023, resulting in a significant decline in the fair market values of long duration fixed rate investment securities. Any sale of investment securities held in an unrealized loss position for liquidity or other purposes will cause actual losses to be realized. Gross unrealized losses on our HTM and AFS investment securities totaled $218 million and $729 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, the FRB began lowering rates as inflationary pressure started to ease. The FRB has indicated additional decreases to the federal funds target rate in 2025, but noted it will continue to assess additional information and implications for the economic outlook in determining future actions with respect to target rates.\nOur earnings also could be adversely affected in a declining rate environment if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities. Because of our relatively high reliance on net interest income, our revenue and earnings are more sensitive to changes in market rates than other financial institutions with more diversified sources of revenue. \nLoan volumes may also be affected by market interest rates on loans. Lower interest rates are typically associated with higher loan originations, but also result in higher loan refinancings which can result in lower average loan yields and the loss of future net servicing revenues on residential loans with an associated write-down of MSRs. In contrast, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates generally decline and result in a lower volume of loan originations. In addition to the impact on our lending business, a decrease in loan originations would adversely affect the volume of loans available for purchase by our mortgage warehouse lending platform.\nIn addition to the potential effects on net interest margin and loan volumes, an increase in the general level of interest rates may affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay interest and principal on their obligations and reduces the amount of non-interest income we can earn due to potentially lower levels of banking business conducted, generally, as well as lower levels of servicing, gain on sale, and other revenues generated through our residential mortgage business. \nThe discontinuation of, or substantial change to, an interest rate benchmark we use in lending, borrowing or hedging may adversely affect our business.\nWe use various interest rate benchmarks in our lending, borrowing and hedging activities. An interest rate benchmark we use in lending, borrowing or hedging may be discontinued or substantially changed in the future. For example, effective January 1, 2022, the administrator of LIBOR ceased the publication of one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, the administrator of LIBOR ceased the publications of the remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six, and 12-month). Additionally, effective November 15, 2024, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited ceased publication of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. \nTransitioning away from an interest rate benchmark to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the transition could: \n•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of our assets and liabilities that are based on the discontinued interest rate benchmark compared to the rate received or paid based on the alternative benchmark rates;\n•adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of other securities or financial arrangements;\n•result in charges to the financial statements and obligation to \"de-designate\" certain interest rate swaps used in hedges of certain loans indexed to the discontinued interest rate benchmark;\n•prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of the discontinued interest rate benchmark with an alternative reference rate; and\n•result in disputes, litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the transition to an alternative reference rate.\nThe transition away from a discontinued interest rate benchmark to an alternative reference rate would require the transition to or development of appropriate systems, models and analytics to effectively transition our risk management and other processes to products based on the applicable alternative reference rate. Such an undertaking would be time consuming and costly. Despite such efforts, the manner and impact of the transition and related developments, as well as the effect of such developments on our funding costs, investment and trading securities portfolios, and business, would be uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nOur financial instruments expose us to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of earnings and AOCI.\nWe hold certain financial instruments measured at fair value. For those financial instruments measured at fair value, we are required to recognize changes in fair value in either earnings or AOCI each quarter. Therefore, any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments will have a corresponding impact on reported earnings or AOCI. Fair value can be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including credit spreads, interest rate volatility, liquidity, and other economic factors. Accordingly, we are subject to mark-to-market risk and the application of fair value accounting which may cause our earnings and AOCI to be more volatile than what may be suggested by our underlying performance.\nDue to the inherent risk associated with accounting estimates, our ACL may be insufficient, which could require us to raise additional capital or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit losses are an inherent risk in the business of making loans. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and maintains an ACL estimated to cover expected losses over the life of the loans in our portfolio. The measurement of expected credit losses takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet (with periodic updates thereafter) and is based on a number of factors, including the size of the portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management’s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio, loan underwriting policies, historical loan loss experience, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, with the exception of residential loans, we individually evaluate all loans identified as problem loans with a total commitment of $1.0 million or more, and establish an allowance based upon our estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans. Additions to the ACL recorded through provision for credit losses decrease our net income. If management’s assumptions and judgments are incorrect or if economic conditions worsen compared to forecast, our actual credit losses may exceed our ACL.\nAt December 31, 2024, our ACL on funded loans and loss contingency on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit totaled $373.8 million and $39.5 million, respectively. Deterioration in the real estate market or general economic conditions could affect the ability of our loan customers to service their debt, which could result in additional loan loss provisions and increases in our ACL. In addition, future volatility in the banking industry and related economic effects, like those experienced during 2023, may adversely impact the Company’s estimate of its ACL and resulting provision for credit losses. We may also be required to record additional loan provisions or increase our ACL based on new information regarding existing loans, input from regulators in connection with their review of our loan portfolio, changes in regulatory guidance, regulations or accounting standards, identification of additional problem loans, changes in economic outlook, and other factors, both within and outside of our management’s control. Moreover, because future events are uncertain and because we may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame. \nAny increases in the provision or ACL would decrease our net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If actual credit losses materially exceed our ACL, we may be required to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and capital.\nA protracted shutdown of the United States government may result in reduced loan originations and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing political polarization in the United States and its government, including disagreement around conflict-related foreign involvement and aid and other politically charged issues may increase the likelihood of a shutdown of the federal government. Any shutdown of the United States government could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, particularly through AmeriHome’s correspondent and retail operations and our small business lending program. A government shutdown could also adversely affect certain of our borrowers which may be dependent on government funding, contractual arrangements or employment, which could affect such borrowers’ ability to pay principal and interest on our loans or their ability or desire to deposit money with or borrow from our bank. Any of these effects could result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in non-performing, criticized, and classified assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to the risk of both natural and man-made disasters.\nMany of the real and personal properties securing our loans are located in California and more generally in the southwestern portion of the United States. Substantial portions of California experience wildfires from time to time that may cause significant damage throughout the state. For example, early in 2025, Southern California has experienced prolonged wildfires that have resulted in extensive damage. While these wildfires have not significantly damaged our own properties or the properties pledged by borrowers as collateral, it is possible our borrowers may experience losses in the future, which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their obligations. California and the southwestern United States are also prone to other natural disasters, including, but not limited to, drought, earthquakes, flooding, and mudslides. In recent years, drought and decreased snowfall in the Rocky Mountains has led to decreased water flow in the Colorado River, from which many areas in the southwest obtain water, including certain of our markets. Persistence of such conditions or additional significant natural or man-made disasters in the state of California or in our other markets could lead to damage or injury to our own properties and/or employees, declines in population in our markets, and increased risk that our borrowers may experience losses or sustained job interruption, which may materially impair their ability to maintain deposits or meet the terms of their loan obligations. Therefore, additional natural disasters, a man-made disaster or a catastrophic event, persistence of detrimental environmental conditions, or a combination of these or other factors, in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nClimate change, societal responses and legislative and regulatory initiatives with respect to climate change could materially affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers and vendors.\nThe lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change makes it impossible to predict the specific impact climate change may have on our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also impact us. In addition to the risk of more frequent and/or severe natural disasters, climate change can result in longer term shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat, sea level rise, declining fresh water resources, and more frequent and prolonged drought. The effects of climate change may have a significant effect in our geographic markets, and could disrupt our operations, the operations of our customers or third parties on which we rely, or supply chains generally. These disruptions, including increased regulation and compliance cost for our customers and changes in consumer behaviors, could result in declines in the economic conditions in geographic markets or industries in which our customers operate and impact their ability to repay loans or maintain deposits and could affect the value of real estate and other assets that serve as collateral for loans. \nBank regulators have increasingly focused on the physical and financial risks to financial institutions associated with climate change, which may result in increased requirements regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending activities. We have also, and may continue, to become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements related to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency, stress testing for various climate stress scenarios, greenhouse gas emissions disclosures, or climate-related financial risk disclosures. New or increased regulations have resulted, and in the future, could result in increased compliance costs or capital requirements. Changes in regulations and customer preferences and behaviors could negatively affect our growth or force us to alter our business strategies, including whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services and which growth industries and customers we pursue. Additionally, our reputation and customer relationships may be damaged due to our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers’ involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEvolving scrutiny and expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to ESG practices may impose additional costs on the Company or expose it to new or additional risks.\nAs a regulated financial institution and a publicly traded company, we are facing evolving scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to ESG practices and disclosure. Frequently, these stakeholders have differing, and sometimes conflicting, views, priorities and expectations regarding ESG issues, which must be considered. State and federal initiatives on social or climate matters may differ or conflict with one another and may also differ from our shareholders' and stakeholders' expectations. These differing, and sometimes conflicting, views, priorities and expectations on ESG issues increase the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards on ESG-related issues, or taking action that conflicts with one or another of our stakeholder’s expectations, could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain customers and business partners, and stock price. Any adverse publicity regarding ESG matters or shifts in investor priorities may result in adverse effects on our stock price and/or our business, operations and \nearnings. Additionally, ESG-related costs, including with respect to compliance with any additional or altered regulatory or disclosure requirements or expectations, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nCredit Risks\nWe are highly dependent on real estate and events negatively impacting the real estate market will hurt our business and earnings.\nA significant portion of our business is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market, and a large part of our loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate. The market for real estate is cyclical and a significant change in the real estate market that results in deterioration in the value of collateral or rental or occupancy rates could adversely affect borrowers’ ability to repay loans. Changes in the real estate market could also affect the value of foreclosed assets. A decline in real estate activity would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact our earnings and financial condition.\nIn recent years, commercial real estate markets have been impacted by economic disruptions, including those resulting from the effects of increases in remote work in urban centers and changes in the characteristics of certain urban centers. CRE loans are generally viewed as having a greater risk of default than other types of loans and depend on cash flows from the owner’s business or the property’s tenants to service the debt. The borrower’s cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions. Adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general business climate and economy or in occupancy rates where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. In particular, CRE office borrowers in central business districts have been impacted by decreased property valuations, oversupply due to remote work trends, and rising interest rates which has increased default rates and impeded their ability to secure new financing. CRE loans generally have large loan balances, and therefore, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of our non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current CRE market. Banking regulatory authorities typically give CRE lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement enhanced risk management practices, including stricter underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, more granular reporting, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposure. If our banking regulators determine that our CRE lending activities are particularly risky and are subject to heightened scrutiny, we may incur significant additional costs or be required to restrict certain of our CRE lending activities. Furthermore, failures in our risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio contains concentrations in certain business lines or product types that have unique risk characteristics and may expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial, residential mortgage, and CRE loans, which contain material concentrations in certain business lines or product types, such as mortgage warehouse, real estate, corporate finance, as well as in specific business sectors such as technology and innovation. These loan concentrations present unique risks and involve specialized underwriting and management as they often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship may adversely affect us. In addition, based on the nature of lending to these specialty markets, repayment of loans may be dependent upon borrowers receiving additional equity financing or, in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering, or other form of liquidity event. \nOur commercial and industrial, CRE, and construction and land development loans, are also largely concentrated in select markets in Arizona, California, and Nevada. As a result of this geographic concentration, deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and charge-offs, an increase in problem assets and foreclosures, a decrease in the demand for our products and services or a decrease in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans. Unforeseen adverse events, changes in economic conditions, and changes in regulatory policy affecting borrowers’ industries or markets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur credit linked notes do not ensure full protection against credit losses, and as such we could still incur significant credit losses on loans for which risk of loss has been transferred pursuant to these transactions.\nWe have entered into transactions to mitigate exposure to losses on our loan portfolio. These transactions are structured as credit linked notes, which transfer the risk of first losses on covered loans to these note holders. These notes have an aggregate principal amount of $434.2 million on a $8.6 billion reference pool of residential mortgages. Pursuant to these arrangements, in the event of borrower default, the principal balance of the notes will be reduced by the amount of the loss, up to the amount of the aggregate principal of the notes. However, all residual risk over and above the first loss position is retained by us. While current estimates of future credit losses are below the first loss position, no assurances can be given that future losses will not exceed the first loss position and, if credit losses were to exceed the first loss position, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely effected. We may enter into more such transactions in the future.\nWe engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property, or consumer protection initiatives or changes in state or federal law may substantially raise the cost of foreclosure or prevent us from foreclosing at all.\nApproximately 57% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2024 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate from time to time to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. As of December 31, 2024, we held $52 million of assets in OREO. The amount that we may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, general or local economic conditions, interest rates, real estate tax rates, zoning laws, governmental and regulatory rules and natural disasters. We may also be subject to environmental cleanup liabilities, assessments and investigations or held liable for personal injury. With respect to foreclosed properties with operations, the performance of these properties will also be dependent on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties as well as control and manage operating expenses. Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of OREO, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, consumer protection initiatives or changes in state or federal law may substantially increase the time and expense associated with the foreclosure process or prevent us from foreclosing at all. A number of states in recent years have either considered or adopted foreclosure reform laws that make it substantially more difficult and expensive for lenders to foreclose on properties in default. If new state or federal laws or regulations are ultimately enacted that significantly raise the cost of foreclosure or raise outright barriers, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our competitors, including money center banks, national and regional commercial banks, community banks, thrift institutions, mutual savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds, financial technology companies and other financial service organizations including private credit funds, compete with lending and deposit-gathering services offered by us. Increased competition in our markets or our inability to compete effectively may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing.\nIn particular, we have experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business and deposits in recent years. Many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Due to their size and brand recognition, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. In addition, some of the non-bank financial services organizations we compete with are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nThe banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results. In particular, our predominate source of revenue is net interest income. Therefore, if we are unable to compete effectively, including sustaining loan and deposit growth at our historical levels, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is also facing increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies such as blockchain and digital payments, often by non-traditional competitors and financial technology companies. Among other things, technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. The elimination of banks as intermediaries for certain transactions, as well as further disruption of traditional bank businesses and products by non-banks, could result in the loss of fee income and deposits and otherwise adversely affect our business and results. \nOur expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nWe continually evaluate expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial assets and businesses. Like previous acquisitions by us, any future acquisitions will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions, including, among other things:\n•time and expense incurred while identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and transactions;\n•difficulty in accurately estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating their credit, operations, management, and market risks;\n•potential payment of a premium over book and market values that may cause dilution of our tangible book value or earnings per share;\n•diversion of our management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n•exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n•potential exposure to asset quality issues of the target company;\n•difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel; \n•potential disruption of our ongoing business; \n•failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; \n•inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems; and\n•failure to realize any expected revenue increases, cost savings, and other projected benefits from an acquisition.\nWe expect competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions, or that we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals needed to complete any such transactions.\nWe may issue equity securities, including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions. We also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions, including subordinated debt issuances, which could cause us to become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nWe cannot provide any assurance we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions. Potential regulatory enforcement actions could also adversely affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition activities. Our inability to overcome the risks inherent in the successful completion and integration of acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy.\nThere are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business, or offer existing products or services to new industries, geographies, or market segments. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or industries are heavily regulated. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. External factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences or government policies, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, product or service or the offering of existing products and services to an emerging industry. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are continuing to pursue digital payments initiatives which are subject to significant uncertainty and could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nWe are continuing to pursue digital payments initiatives and implementation of a fully integrated digital banking platform for our customers. The digital payments products and services we offer may use or rely on blockchain-based technologies or assets. Use of blockchain-based technologies in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving. Blockchain and digital payment technology has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. Any changes in such laws and regulations applicable to, or scrutiny directed at, our products and services may impede or delay the offering of digital payments solutions, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance the digital payments products and services we offer and the technologies we have chosen to implement will be accepted and desired by customers. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully integrate and market such digital payments products and services. We also will continue to incur increased costs in connection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, including members of our leadership and management teams.\nOur business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level. In particular, our relative success to date has been partly the result of our management’s ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees in leadership and administrative support roles, and experienced bankers with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have long-standing relationships in their communities or markets, including with respect to our business-to-business mortgage platform. These professionals bring with them valuable knowledge, specialized skills and expertise, customer relationships and in some cases extensive ties within markets upon which our competitive strategy is based, and have been an integral part of our ability to attract deposits and to expand market share. We have not entered into employment agreements with most of our employees and competition for talent in our industry is strong. In addition, the proliferation of hybrid work environments may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. We incentivize employee retention through our equity incentive plans; however, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our equity incentive plans in retaining these key employees and executives. Were we to lose key employees, we may not be able to replace them with equally qualified persons who bring the same skills and knowledge of and ties to the communities and markets where we operate. If we are unable to retain qualified employees or hire new qualified employees to keep up with or outpace employee turnover, we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy or may incur additional costs to achieve our objectives. \nWe could be harmed if our succession planning is inadequate to mitigate the loss of key members of our senior management team.\nWe believe our senior management team has contributed greatly to our performance. In addition, we from time to time experience retirements and other changes to our senior management team. Our future performance depends on a smooth transition of our senior management, including finding and training highly qualified replacements who are properly equipped to lead us. We have adopted retention strategies, including equity awards, from which our senior management team benefits in order to achieve our goals. However, we cannot assure our succession planning and retention strategies will be effective and the loss of senior management could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards and liquidity rules, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWAL and WAB are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying executive bonuses or dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities. At December 31, 2024, our CET1 ratio was 11.3%, which is above the well-capitalized regulatory ratio threshold of 6.5%. Although our capital ratios are in line with our targets, we may need to issue additional equity capital or reduce the pace at which we are growing in order to increase our CET1 and other capital ratios. \nIf we lose a significant portion of our core deposits, whether through a significant deposit relationship or concentrations in an industry, or our cost of funding deposits increases significantly, our liquidity and/or profitability would be adversely impacted.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations and support loan growth and, specifically, to attract and retain a stable base of relatively low-cost deposits. Shortly following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023, we and certain other banks experienced a brief period of elevated deposit withdrawals. We cannot be assured similar unusual deposit withdrawal activity will not affect banks generally or us in the future. If we were to lose a significant portion of our low-cost deposits, whether through a significant deposit relationship or concentrations in an industry, our liquidity would be adversely impacted. Additionally, if our borrowings increase or remain elevated in future periods, our net interest margin and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, the competition for these relatively low-cost deposits in our markets is strong and customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return. Additionally, we may accept brokered deposits, which may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. We offer reciprocal deposit products through third party networks to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts exceeding the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution. We also from time to time offer other credit enhancements to depositors, such as FHLB letters of credit and, for certain deposits of public monies, pledges of collateral in the form of readily marketable securities. Any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits our ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits, such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at our bank subsidiary, could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain deposits. \nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify investors under certain circumstances. \nA substantial portion of our mortgage banking operations involves the sale of loans to third parties, including through securitization. When loans are sold or securitized, we make customary representations and warranties about such loans to the loan purchaser or through documents governing our securitized loan pools. If a mortgage loan does not comply with the representations and warranties made with respect to it at the time of its sale, we could be required to repurchase the loan, replace it with a substitute loan and/or indemnify secondary market purchasers or investors for losses, and may not have recourse to the correspondent seller that sold the mortgage loans and breached similar or other representations and warranties. Significant indemnification or repurchase activity on securitized or sold loans without offsetting recourse to a counterparty from which the loan was purchased could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB, and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have $5.1 billion of borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco and no borrowings from the FRB. We utilize borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco and the FRB to satisfy short-term liquidity needs. Our borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of our collateral pledged to these entities. These lenders could reduce our borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or terminate their loan programs. Any change to or termination of these programs could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nA change in our creditworthiness could increase our cost of funding or adversely affect our liquidity.\nMarket participants regularly evaluate our creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of our long-term debt based on a number of factors, some of which are not entirely within our control, including our financial strength and conditions within the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that our perceived creditworthiness will remain the same. Changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and our access to the capital markets, and could increase our cost of capital. Likewise, any loss of or decline in the credit rating assigned to us could impair our ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources, or increase our cost of funding.\nOperational and Technological Risks\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information. Moreover, a portion of our employees work remotely at least some of the time. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and security of our customers’ information across all geographies and product lines, and endeavor \nto modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software, and networks and those of our customers and third-party vendors are, and are likely to continue to be vulnerable to unauthorized payments and account access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks, and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses to us and/or our customers. These threats may originate externally from increasingly sophisticated third parties, including foreign governments, organized criminal groups, and other hackers, or from outsourced or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. For example, we recently became aware that a threat actor obtained unauthorized access to files transferred through a third-party secure file transfer software used by WAB, as further described under Item 9B “Other Information” of this Form 10-K.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies has also given rise to additional vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyber threats. In addition, we may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to our customers’ systems. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of many of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe maintain insurance policies that we believe provide reasonable coverage for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, or penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party’s systems failing or experiencing an attack.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components for our business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While we have a robust due diligence process in place to select third-party vendors, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, or poor performance by a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also impact our operations if those difficulties interfere with their ability to serve us. Replacing third-party vendors could create significant delays and expense and there is no guarantee that such replacement vendors will be available at comparable rates, on similar terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. Any of these things could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur business may be adversely affected by fraud.\nAs a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to a wide range of operational risks, including, but not limited to, theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers, and other third parties targeting us and/or our customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. \nAlthough we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the persistence and increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.\nOur controls and processes, our reporting systems and procedures, and our operational infrastructure may not be able to keep pace with our growth, which could cause us to experience compliance and operational problems, lose customers, or incur additional expenditures, any one of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur future success will depend on the ability of officers and other key employees to effectively implement solutions designed to continually enhance operational, credit, financial, management and other internal risk controls and processes, as well as improve reporting systems and procedures, while at the same time maintaining and growing existing businesses and client relationships. We may not successfully implement such changes or improvements in an efficient or timely manner, or we may discover deficiencies in our existing systems and controls that adversely affect our ability to support and grow our existing businesses and client relationships, and could require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and \noperational infrastructure. If we are unable to maintain and implement improvements to our controls, processes, and reporting systems and procedures, we may lose customers, experience compliance and operational problems or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections, any one of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or ineffective, which could result in unexpected losses or other material adverse impacts.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk while appropriately balancing risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor, and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, but not limited to credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk. A BOD level risk committee approves and reviews our key risk management policies and oversees operation of our risk management framework. Although we have devoted significant resources to developing our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, may be ineffective. In addition, as regulations and the markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate significant or material risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or other material adverse impacts. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, or are subject to ineffective governance, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified, or mitigated.\nOur internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and the accuracy of judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters may impact operating results and financial condition.\nOur management regularly reviews and updates internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Similarly, our management makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to understand and adapt to technological change and implement new technology-driven products and services, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, largely related to increased digitization of banking services and capabilities (including those related to or involving artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and other technologies) and mobile banking solutions. We expect new technologies will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies currently used in our products and services. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Developing or acquiring new technologies and incorporating them into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We cannot predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted or how those technologies may be regulated. We also may not be able to effectively market new technology-driven products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation, and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, and the DIF, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, require monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity and of customers who are perceived to present a heightened risk of money laundering or other illegal activity, limit the dividends or distributions that WAB can pay to WAL or that we can pay to our stockholders, restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee our debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive \nand result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than prescribed by GAAP, among other things. Our mortgage warehouse lending operations subject us to regulations that have grown in complexity in recent years and may continue to do so as consumer protection measures change. Our mortgage warehouse lending operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions, including those designed to discourage predatory lending and regulate collections and servicing practices with respect to mortgage loans.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs. To the extent we continue to grow and become more complex, regulatory oversight, risk management, and the cost of compliance will likely increase, which may adversely affect us. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supervision and Regulation” included in this Form 10-K for a more detailed summary of the regulations and supervision to which we are subject.\nChanges to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations, including the passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA, have drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. In general, bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and regulatory compliance, and we expect this focus to continue. Additional compliance requirements may be costly to implement, may require additional compliance personnel, and may limit our ability to offer competitive products to our customers.\nWe are also subject to changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are under continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, WAB, and our other subsidiaries. Any changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws, and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles or an alleged failure to comply, even if we acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry and broader economy may be subject to new or changing legislation, regulation and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from both Houses of Congress having majority memberships from the Republican party and President Trump’s election. President Trump and certain members of Congress have advocated for the reduction of regulation of the financial services industry. The new Congress and administration may also cause broader economic changes due to their governing ideology, which differs from that of the previous Congress and administration. New appointments to the FRB could affect monetary policy and interest rates. Additionally, changes in trade and fiscal policy could affect the economy and banking industry, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations and in the way existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nState and federal banking agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, CFPB, and OCC periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management was in violation of any law or regulation, the agency may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, and to assess civil monetary penalties against us and/or officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. If the FDIC concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, it may terminate WAB’s deposit insurance. Under Arizona law, the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to our state-chartered bank. The CFPB also has the authority to examine us and to take enforcement actions, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties against us if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive manner. Finally, our AmeriHome subsidiary needs to maintain certain state licenses and federal and \ngovernment-sponsored agency approvals required to conduct its business and is subject to periodic examinations by such state and federal agencies, which can result in increases in administrative costs, substantial penalties due to compliance errors, or the loss of licenses.\nIf we were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If our regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisitions and develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business. We also could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities, or both, within a prescribed period of time. Failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above. In the event we were ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action, we could fail and be placed into receivership by the FDIC or the chartering agency. The terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility, and financial condition.\nCurrent and proposed regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs and impact our reputation.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws related to consumer privacy and data use and security, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the California Consumer Protection Act. These rules require financial institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requirements as to consumer notification in the event of data breaches and certain types of security breaches. Additional regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs, which could negatively impact earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy, data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties, reputational harm, loss of consumer confidence, and other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws, tax audits, or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations. Income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Changes in tax laws, changes in interpretations, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, or challenges to judgments or actions that we may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact our current and future financial performance.\nIn addition, our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state and local taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state and local taxing authorities have been increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. Any such challenges that are not resolved in our favor may adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition.\nSecurities-Related Risks\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us.\nThe price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange constantly changes. There can be no assurances about the market price for our common stock. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock or depositary shares when you want and at prices you find attractive.\nOur stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our financial performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our stock price include:\n•actual or anticipated changes in the political climate or public policy;\n•volatility and economic disruption in the banking industry, such as that experienced in 2023, or the economy more broadly;\n•changes in national and global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, inflation, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other global, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that effect the financial markets and economy including pandemics, terrorism and war, including the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; \n•sales of our equity securities;\n•our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness, and prospects;\n•quarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n•operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n•changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our competitors;\n•the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n•the credit, mortgage, and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n•changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve;\n•events affecting the financial services industry generally or financial institutions similar to us or that may be viewed as similar to us; and\n•our past and future dividend and share repurchase practices.\nMoreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our normal business.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or depositary shares representing preferred stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We also grant a significant number of shares of common stock to employees and directors under our Incentive Plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of our common stock, depositary shares, or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock, depositary shares, and preferred stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on market conditions, our acquisition activity, and other factors, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock as we have in the past.\nWe have paid regular quarterly dividends on our common stock since the third quarter of 2019, subject to quarterly declarations by the BOD, and have also paid dividends on our depositary shares representing our preferred stock since the issuance of such securities in the third quarter of 2021. We have previously adopted common stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we have repurchased shares of our outstanding common stock, the most recent of which expired in December 2020. \nOur dividend payments and/or stock repurchase practices may change from time-to-time, and no assurance can be provided that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all, or institute a new stock repurchase program. Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and the discretion of our BOD, which must evaluate, among other things, whether cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and any agreements containing provisions that limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends and/or repurchase stock. Furthermore, our outstanding Series A preferred stock is senior to our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on common stock. Under the terms of the Series A preferred stock, we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless all dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments or dividend program could have a negative effect on our stock price. \nOfferings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may from time to time issue debt securities, borrow money through other means, or issue preferred stock. We may also borrow money from the FRB, the FHLB, other financial institutions, and other lenders. At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding subordinated debt, senior secured and unsecured debt, and short-term borrowings. We also have outstanding depositary shares representing Series A preferred stock, which is senior to our common stock. All of these securities or borrowings have priority over our common stock in a liquidation, which could affect the market price of our stock.\nOur BOD is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our BOD also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding-up, and liquidation and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock, with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock and/or the rights of holders of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Additionally, our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes our BOD to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.",
