      "text": "\nItem 1.        Business.      \nYum! Brands, Inc. (referred to herein as “YUM”, the “Registrant” or the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina in 1997. The principal executive offices of YUM are located at 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, and the telephone number at that location is (502) 874-8300. Our website address is https://www.yum.com.\nYUM, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the Company. The terms “we,” “us” and “our” are also used in the Form 10-K to refer to the Company. Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably. While YUM does not directly own or operate any restaurants, throughout this document we may refer to restaurants that are owned or operated by our subsidiaries as being Company-owned.\nOverview of Business\nYUM has over 61,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories primarily operating under the four concepts of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill (the “Concepts”). The Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, Mexican-inspired food and pizza categories, respectively. Habit Burger & Grill is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. At December 31, 2024, 98% of our Concepts’ units are operated by independent franchisees or licensees under the terms of franchise or license agreements. The terms franchise or franchisee within this Form 10-K are meant to describe third parties that operate units under either franchise or license agreements. \nThe following is a brief description of each Concept and a summary of our Concepts’ operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n\n                                                         Number of Units                  % of Units International                Number of Countries and Territories                  % Franchised                System Sales(a) (in Millions)\nKFC Division                                              31,981                                     89          %                                  150                                   99      %                          $34,452            \nTaco Bell Division                                         8,757                                     13          %                                   33                                   94      %                           17,193            \nPizza Hut Division                                        20,225                                     68          %                                  111                                   99      %                           13,108            \nHabit Burger &amp; Grill Division         383                                                         2          %                                    3                                   17      %                              713            \nYUM                                                       61,346                                     70          %                                  156                                   98      %                          $65,466            \n(a)    Constitutes sales of all restaurants, both Company-owned and franchised. See further discussion of this performance metric within Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nKFC\nKFC was founded in Corbin, Kentucky, by Colonel Harland D. Sanders, an early developer of the quick service food business and a pioneer of the restaurant franchise concept. The Colonel perfected his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1939 and signed up his first franchisee in 1952. KFC restaurants across the world offer fried and non-fried chicken products such as sandwiches, chicken strips, chicken-on-the-bone and other chicken products marketed under a variety of names. \nTaco Bell\nThe first Taco Bell restaurant was opened in 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California, and in 1964, the first Taco Bell franchise was sold. Taco Bell specializes in Mexican-style food products, including various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and other related items.\nPizza Hut\nThe first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, and within a year, the first franchise unit was opened. Today, Pizza Hut specializes in the sale of ready-to-eat pizza products and operates in the delivery, carryout and casual dining segments around the world. \nHabit Burger & Grill\nThe first Habit Burger & Grill restaurant opened in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California. The Habit Burger & Grill restaurant concept is built around a distinctive and diverse menu that includes chargrilled burgers and sandwiches made-to-order over an open flame and topped with fresh ingredients.\nBusiness Strategy\nThrough our Recipe for Good Growth we intend to deliver iconic restaurant brands and consistently drive better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. Key enablers include accelerated use of digital and technology, increased collaboration and better leverage of our systemwide scale. This is done through a framework of three pillars: being Loved, Trusted and Connected.\nLoved: We grow by delighting customers with craveable food and a distinctive experience. We innovate and elevate our iconic restaurant brands that people trust and champion, resulting in relevant, easy and distinctive brands.\nTrusted: We operate responsibly with consistency and efficiency in our restaurants, across our system and in our communities. This includes a commitment to our priorities for social responsibility, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.\nConnected: We use our teamwork, technology and global scale to serve every customer, everywhere, anytime. Our unmatched operating capability allows us to recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. And our commitment to bold restaurant development drives market and franchise unit expansion with strong economics. \nOur unrivaled culture and talent and leading with smart, heart and courage are key to our success, fueling brand performance and franchise success. \nInformation about Operating Segments\nAs of December 31, 2024, YUM consists of four operating segments:  \n•The KFC Division which includes our worldwide operations of the KFC concept\n•The Taco Bell Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Taco Bell concept\n•The Pizza Hut Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Pizza Hut concept\n•The Habit Burger & Grill Division which includes our worldwide operations of the Habit Burger & Grill concept\nFranchise Agreements\nThe franchise programs of the Company are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchises. The Company is focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our Concepts. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one restaurant to large publicly-traded companies. The Company has franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business, such as our relationship with Yum China (defined below) and our relationships with certain other large franchisees.\nThe Company currently has approximately 1,500 franchisees with whom we have franchise contracts. The Company utilizes both store-level franchise and master franchise programs to grow our businesses. Of our over 60,000 franchised units at December 31, 2024, approximately 35% operate under our master franchise programs, including over 15,400 units in mainland China. The remainder of our franchise units operate under store-level franchise agreements. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business. In certain historical refranchising transactions the Company may have retained ownership of land and building and continues to lease them to the franchisee. Store-level franchise agreements typically require payment to the Company of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening of a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their restaurants’ sales (typically between 4% to 6%) and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand. Under master franchise arrangements, the Company enters into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate restaurants as well as sub-franchise restaurants within certain geographic territories. Master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of sub-franchisees. In exchange, \nmaster franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the sub-franchisees under their franchise agreements and often pay lower fees for the restaurants they operate. \nOn October 31, 2016, we completed the spin-off of our China business into an independent, publicly-traded company under the name of Yum China Holdings, Inc. (“Yum China”). As our largest master franchisee, Yum China, pays the Company a continuing fee of 3% on system sales of our Concepts in mainland China. The use by Yum China of certain of our material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Yum China, and YUM, through YRI China Franchising LLC, a subsidiary of YUM.\nThe Company seeks to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, technology, equipment, operational improvements and standards. \nRestaurant Operations\nThrough its Concepts, YUM develops, operates and franchises a worldwide system of both traditional and non-traditional Quick Service Restaurants (“QSR”). Traditional units can feature dine-in, carryout, drive-thru and delivery services. Non-traditional units include express units that have a more limited menu, usually generate lower sales volumes and operate in non-traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, train stations, subways, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient.\nMost restaurants in each Concept offer consumers the ability to dine in, carryout and/or have the Concepts’ food delivered either by store-level personnel or third-party delivery services such as aggregators. In addition, Taco Bell, KFC and Habit Burger & Grill offer a drive-thru option in many stores. Pizza Hut offers a drive-thru option on a much more limited basis.  \nRestaurant management structure varies by Concept, unit size and franchise organization. Generally, each restaurant is led by a restaurant general manager (“RGM”), together with one or more assistant managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each Concept issues manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. Each franchise organization and their respective restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their units, including all matters related to employment of restaurant staff, and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. \nDigital and technology are at the core of our Recipe for Good Growth. In recent years the Company has focused on building and acquiring a distinctive set of solutions with next-generation capabilities tailored for our brands and scaling these common digital and technology platforms across the globe. In 2024, we accelerated our technology transformation by integrating our digital and technology teams into a unified global team. Additionally, we have introduced our Byte by Yum! platform, a comprehensive collection of proprietary software as a service and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven products that enables easy operations for team members and improved experiences for customers, while consolidating essential systems into a cohesive, easy-to-manage platform. The Byte by Yum! platform includes online and mobile app ordering, point of sale, kitchen and delivery optimization, menu management, inventory and labor management and team member tools. The implementation of Byte by Yum! is also designed to enable a faster and more impactful adoption of AI by YUM and its brands, and offers franchisees leading technology capabilities with advantaged economics made possible by the scale of YUM all with a goal of unlocking new insights and driving profitable sales growth. \nDigital sales include transactions where consumers at system restaurants utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology. In 2024, our system restaurants generated digital sales of $33 billion, representing over 50% of overall system sales.\nThe Company and its Concepts own numerous registered trademarks. The Company believes that many of these marks, including our Kentucky Fried Chicken®, KFC®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut® and The Habit® marks, have significant value and material importance to our business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of important marks whenever feasible and to challenge any infringement of our marks vigorously. The use of certain of these marks by franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements. Under current law and with proper use, the Company’s rights in our marks can generally last indefinitely. The Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment and technology which, while valuable, are not currently considered material to our business.\nSupply and Distribution\nThe Company and franchisees of the Concepts are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products, paper and packaging materials. Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate. When prices increase, the Concepts may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done in practice. The Company does not typically experience significant continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these supplies are generally available.  \nIn the U.S., the Company, along with the representatives of the Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchisee groups, are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (“RSCS”), a third party which is responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment. Additionally, Habit Burger & Grill entered into a purchasing agreement with RSCS effective July 31, 2020. The core mission of RSCS is to provide the lowest possible sustainable store-delivered prices for restaurant products and equipment.  This arrangement combines the purchasing power of the Company-owned and franchisee restaurants, which the Company believes leverages the system’s scale to drive cost savings and effectiveness in the purchasing function. The Company also believes that RSCS fosters closer alignment of interests and a stronger relationship with our franchisee community.\nMost food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurant units by third-party distribution companies. In the U.S., McLane Foodservice, Inc. is the distributor for the majority of items used in Company-owned restaurants and for a substantial number of franchisee restaurants.  Outside the U.S., we and our Concepts’ franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors. Our international franchisees generally select and manage their own third-party suppliers and distributors, subject to our internal standards. All suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products and/or services that comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the state and/or country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards.\nAdvertising and Promotional Programs\nCompany-owned and franchise restaurants are required to spend a percentage of their respective restaurants’ sales on advertising programs with the goal of increasing sales and enhancing the reputation of the Concepts. Advertising may be conducted nationally, regionally and locally. When multiple franchisees operate in the same country or region, the national and regional advertising spending is typically conducted by a cooperative to which the franchisees and Company-owned restaurants, if any, contribute funds as a percentage of restaurants’ sales. The contributions are primarily used to pay for expenses relating to purchasing media for advertising, market research, commercial production, talent payments and other support functions for the respective Concepts. We have the right to control the advertising activities of certain advertising cooperatives, typically in markets where we have Company-owned restaurants, through our majority voting rights.\nWorking Capital\nInformation about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.\nSeasonal Operations\nThe Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.\nCompetition\nThe retail food industry, in which our Concepts compete, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including those in the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service reputation, restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties. Competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas. Our Concepts also face competition as a result of convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes. The retail food industry is often affected by: changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Within the retail food industry, each of our Concepts competes with international, national and regional chains as well as locally-owned establishments, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.  Given the various types and vast number of competitors, our Concepts do not constitute a significant portion of the retail food industry in terms of number of system units or system sales, either on a worldwide or individual country basis.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2024, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.\nGovernment Regulation\nU.S. Operations.  The Company and its U.S. operations, as well as our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, privacy, labor and employment, health, marketing, food labeling, competition, public accommodation, sanitation and safety. Each of our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing requirements and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. In addition, each Concept must comply with various state and federal laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely affected by such licensing requirements and regulations or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.\nInternational Operations.  Our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which have similarities to those affecting U.S. restaurants but may differ among jurisdictions. Like restaurants in the U.S., restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to certain regulations and tariffs on imported commodities and equipment, laws regulating foreign investment and anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  \nSee Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 40,000 persons (collectively referred to throughout this filing as \"our employees\" or \"YUM employees\"), including approximately 23,000 employees in the U.S. and approximately 17,000 employees outside the U.S. Approximately 85% of our employees work in restaurants while the remainder work in our restaurant-support centers. In the U.S., approximately 85% of our Company-owned restaurant employees are part-time and approximately 40% have been employed by the Company for less than a year. Some of our International employees are subject to labor council relationships whose terms vary due to the diverse countries in which the Company operates.\nIn addition to the persons employed by the Company and its subsidiaries, our approximately 60,000 franchise restaurants around the world are responsible for the employment of over an estimated 1 million people who work in and support those restaurants. Each year YUM and our franchisees around the world create thousands of restaurant jobs, which are part-time, entry-level opportunities to grow careers at our KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill brands. As evidence of the opportunities these positions create, approximately 80% of the Company-owned Restaurant General Managers (“RGMs”) \nlocated in the U.S. have been promoted from other positions in our brands’ restaurants and such RGMs often earn pay greater than the average American household income.\nHuman capital management considerations are integral to our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, the drivers of which include leveraging our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success, as well as recruiting and equipping the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. Our investment in people includes creating a culture of engagement that attracts, retains and grows the best people and creates high performance in our restaurants. We are also highly focused on building an inclusive culture among our employees, franchisees, suppliers and partners that reflects all of our customers and communities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage with respect to the performance of our business. Our commitments and progress towards our vision of culture, opportunity and belonging are reflected below.\n•Continually building upon ongoing inclusion efforts to help ensure our workplaces are environments where all people can be successful. \n•Consistent with our Code of Conduct, making employment-related decisions based on an individual's abilities and merit, not personal characteristics that are unrelated to the job.\n•Measuring YUM employee engagement regularly. For example, every other year we conduct a global employee engagement survey of all employees working in our restaurant support centers. The most recent survey conducted was in 2023 and reflected an engagement level among our employees significantly exceeding the average engagement levels of benchmarked companies. \n•Providing YUM employees with training and development that builds world-class leaders and drives business results.\n•Enabling a culture that fuels results and cross-brand collaboration on operational execution, people capability and customer experience initiatives throughout our system.\n•Assessing progress towards lowering turnover and increasing retention rates, particularly at the restaurant-employee level.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available, through the Investor Relations section of its internet website at https://www.yum.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) at https://www.sec.gov.   \nOur Corporate Governance Principles and our Code of Conduct are also located within the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.

      "text": "\nItem 1A.       Risk Factors.     \nYou should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, expectations and historical trends. Any of the following risk factors, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, growth prospects, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. \nRisks Related to Food Safety and Catastrophic Events\nFood safety and food- or beverage-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business and/or our growth prospects.\nFood or beverage-borne illnesses (that can be caused by food-borne pathogens such as E. coli, Listeria, Salmonella, Cyclospora and Trichinosis) and food safety issues (such as food tampering, contamination including with respect to allergens or adulteration) have occurred and may occur within our system from time to time. In addition, the health and environmental risks of certain ubiquitous substances (including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) commonly found in packaging have been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits against us and other restaurant companies. Any report linking our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants, our suppliers or distributors or otherwise involving the types of products used at our restaurants, or linking our competitors, suppliers, distributors or the retail food industry generally, to instances of food- or beverage-borne illness or food safety issues or substances having perceived health or environmental risks could result in adverse publicity and otherwise adversely affect us and possibly lead to consumer complaints, litigation and/or governmental investigations. There is also a risk that we or our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants, suppliers or distributors under report food safety incidents or system failures, which could hinder response and tracking of such risks. Moreover, our Concepts’ restaurants' reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors and increasing reliance on food delivery aggregators may increase the risk that food- or beverage-borne illness incidents and food safety issues could be caused by factors outside of our control. If a customer is believed to have become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues, remediation efforts could include temporary closure of restaurants, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation, business and/or our growth prospects. The occurrence of food-borne pathogens in restaurant products or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and/or lower margins for us and our Concepts’ franchisees.\nOur business may be adversely affected by adverse public health conditions or the occurrence of other catastrophic or unforeseen events.\nIf public health conditions related to the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) were to significantly worsen in markets where we conduct significant operations, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted, and we may be unable to effectively respond to any such developments. In addition, our business and/or growth prospects could be adversely impacted by various catastrophic or other unforeseen events (which may be beyond our control), including health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, military conflict, terrorism, political, financial or social instability, boycotts, social or civil unrest, workplace violence, or other events that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants, particularly if located in regions where we have significant operations.\nIn addition, our operations could be disrupted if any employees at our, our Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurants or our business partner employees had or were suspected of having avian flu or swine flu, or other highly communicable illnesses such as hepatitis A or norovirus, since this could require us, our Concepts’ franchisees, or our business partners to quarantine some or all of such employees and close facilities, including restaurants. Prior outbreaks of avian flu have resulted in confirmed human cases and it is possible that outbreaks could reach pandemic levels. Public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry, which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products, which would adversely affect us given that poultry is widely offered at our Concepts’ restaurants. Avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry, which could negatively impact our business.\nFurthermore, other viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk or perceived risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public, which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants. We could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose mandatory or voluntary closures, impose restrictions on operations of restaurants, or restrict the import or export of products, or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. \nRisks Related to our Business Strategy and Reliance upon Franchisees\nOur operating results and growth strategies are closely tied to the success of our Concepts’ franchisees.\nThe vast majority (98%) of our restaurants are operated by our Concepts’ franchisees. Our long-term growth depends on maintaining the pace of our new unit growth rate largely through our Concepts’ franchisees. We also rely on master franchisees, who have rights to license to sub-franchisees the right to develop and operate restaurants, to achieve our expectations for new unit development. If our Concepts’ franchisees and master franchisees do not meet our expectations for new unit development, we may not achieve our desired growth. \nWe have limited control over how our Concepts’ franchisees’ businesses are run, and their inability to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalties, advertising funds contributions, and fees paid to us for other discrete services we may provide to our Concepts’ franchisees Our control is further limited where we utilize master franchise arrangements, which require us to rely on our master franchisees to enforce sub-franchisee compliance with our operating standards. \nIf our Concepts’ franchisees fail to adequately capitalize their businesses or incur too much debt, if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that franchisees are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt, it could result in their financial distress, including insolvency or bankruptcy, or the inability to meet development targets or obligations. If any significant franchisee of our Concepts individually or in the aggregate becomes, financially distressed, as has occurred from time to time, our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed fee payments that cause us to record bad debt expense and reduced advertising fund contributions, and we could experience reduced new unit development. \nIn addition, we are secondarily liable on certain Concepts’ franchisees’ restaurant lease agreements, including lease agreements that we have guaranteed or assigned to franchisees, and our operating results and/or growth prospects could be impacted by any rent obligations to the extent such franchisees default on these lease agreements.\nOur results may also be impacted by whether our Concepts’ franchisees implement marketing programs or other major initiatives, such as restaurant remodels or equipment or technology upgrades, which may require financial investment by such franchisees. Our Concepts may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for growth if our Concepts’ franchisees do not participate, which may harm our growth prospects and financial results. Additionally, the failure of our Concepts’ franchisees to focus on key elements of restaurant operations, such as compliance with our operating standards addressing quality, service and cleanliness (even if such failures do not breach the franchise documents), may be attributed by guests to our Concepts’ brand and could negatively impact our reputation, business and/or our growth prospects.\nFranchisee noncompliance with our franchise agreements and/or or brand standards may also adversely impact customer perception of our Concepts’ brands, including by failing to meet health and safety standards, to engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or to comply with cybersecurity requirements, as well as through the participation in improper business practices. \nMoreover, franchisee noncompliance with our franchise agreements and/or brand standards may lead to us to terminate franchise agreements and close related stores, which may have an impact on our results. For example, on January 8, 2025, we terminated franchise agreements with the owner and operator of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey after failure to meet our brand standards. \nWe have franchise relationships that are particularly important to our business due to their scale and/or growth prospects such as our relationship with Yum China, our largest franchisee. In connection with the spin-off of our China business in 2016 into an independent publicly-traded company (the “Separation” or “Yum China spin-off”), we entered into a Master License Agreement (“MLA”) pursuant to which Yum China is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Concepts and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in mainland China. Any failure to realize the expected benefits of key franchise relationships, including with Yum China, may adversely impact our business and growth prospects. \nOur growth strategy depends upon our and our franchisees’ ability to successfully open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably.\nOur growth strategy depends on our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ ability to increase the number of restaurants around the world. The successful development of new units depends in large part on the ability of our Concepts’ franchisees to open new \nrestaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets, and we cannot guarantee that we, or our Concepts’ franchisees, including Yum China, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably, consistent with results of existing restaurants or with our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ expectations. Other risks that could impact our ability to open new restaurants include: (i) economic conditions and trade or economic policies or sanctions, (ii) our ability to attract new franchisees, (iii) new restaurant construction and development costs, (iv) our Concepts’ franchisees’ ability to meet new restaurant permitting, construction, development and team member training timelines, and (v) supply chain challenges, including our ability to secure sufficient supply to support new restaurants.\nExpansion could also be affected by our Concepts’ franchisees’ willingness to invest capital or ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants. If it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our Concepts’ franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, or if the perceived return on invested capital is not sufficiently attractive, our expected growth and future financial results could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, new restaurants could impact the sales of our Concepts’ existing restaurants nearby, and the risks of such sales cannibalization may become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from past or potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic transactions, or our portfolio business model.\nFrom time to time we have completed, and we may evaluate and continue to complete, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, strategic partnerships, minority investments (including minority investments in third parties, such as, franchisees or master franchisees) and other strategic transactions.\nPast and potential future strategic transactions may involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation: \n•expenses, delays or difficulties in integrating acquired companies, joint ventures, strategic partnerships or investments into our organization, including the failure to realize expected synergies and/or the inability to retain key personnel; \n•diversion of management’s attention from other initiatives and/or day-to-day operations to effectively execute our growth strategy; \n•inability to generate sufficient revenue, profit, and cash flow from acquired companies, joint ventures, strategic partnerships or investments;\n•the possibility that we have acquired substantial contingent or unanticipated liabilities in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions; and\n•the possibility that our interests and strategic direction do not align with those of acquired companies or other parties that maintain an interest in our investments.\nPast and potential future strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us and may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, growth prospects and financial results. In addition, our investments, including minority investments in certain franchisees, are potentially subject to changes in value, including through impairment, which have caused and could continue to cause, fluctuations in our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nWe have significant exposure to the Chinese market through our largest franchisee, Yum China, which subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business and/or our growth prospects.\nA meaningful portion of our total business, particularly with respect to our KFC Concept, is conducted in mainland China through our largest franchisee, Yum China. We are contractually entitled to receive a 3% sales-based license fee on all Yum China system sales related to our KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Concepts. Yum China’s business is exposed to risks in mainland China, which include, among others, potential political, financial and social instability, changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and ongoing wage and commodity inflation), consumer preferences, the regulatory environment (including uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations), heightened data and cybersecurity risks associated with the conduct of business in China, and food safety related matters (including compliance with food safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety). Any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.–China relations, including as a result of changes in U.S.–China foreign policy, trade regimes or trade disputes, or geopolitical developments, could adversely affect our Concepts in mainland China. Additionally, Chinese law regulates Yum China’s business conducted in mainland China, and as such our license fee from the Yum China business is subject to numerous uncertainties based on Chinese laws, regulations and policies, which may change \nfrom time to time. If Yum China’s business is harmed or development of our Concepts’ restaurants is slowed in mainland China due to any of these factors, it could negatively impact the license fee paid by Yum China to us, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nOur relationship with Yum China is governed primarily by the MLA, as amended from time to time, which may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of Yum China. In addition, if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in mainland China, if Yum China is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under the MLA, or if the MLA is otherwise terminated, it could result in an interruption in the operation of our brands that have been exclusively licensed to Yum China for use in mainland China. Disputes over the proper interpretation of the MLA have arisen in the past and may arise from time to time in the future. Such interruption or disputes could cause a delay in, or loss of, the license fee paid to us, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nOur global operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nA significant portion of our Concepts’ restaurants are operated outside of the U.S., and we intend to continue expansion of our global operations. As a result, our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ business and/or growth prospects are increasingly exposed to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by country, include political, financial or social instability or conditions, corruption, increasing anti-American sentiment and perception of our Concepts as American brands, social and ethnic unrest, natural disasters, military conflicts and terrorism, as well as exposure to the macroeconomic environment in such markets, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in markets in which there are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and contract and intellectual property rights), and income and non-income based tax rates and laws. Additional risks include the impact of trade disputes, restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade or foreign investment, potential increases in tariffs, import restrictions and controls, sanctions, foreign exchange control regimes (including restrictions on currency conversion), health guidelines and safety protocols, labor costs and conditions, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices, and the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our Concepts’ restaurants are operated. For example, we have been subject to a regulatory enforcement action in India alleging violation of foreign exchange laws for failure to satisfy conditions of certain operating approvals, such as minimum investment and store build requirements as well as limitations on the remittance of fees outside of the country (see Note 20). \nAs a result of our global operations, we also have significant exposure to geopolitical events and instability. We have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected, by events such as the conflict in the Middle East as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and ongoing geopolitical instability associated therewith. Such conflicts have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our business and operations as result of, among other things, the economic consequences and disruptions from such conflicts, increased energy and supply prices, weaker consumer sentiment for Western brands, consumer reaction to perceived acts or failures to act by us or our Concepts including maintaining operations in countries or regions that are linked to such conflicts, and economic sanctions restricting cross-border commerce. In particular, sales in certain of our markets were adversely impacted in 2024 by the conflict in the Middle East. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of this conflict, sales may continue to be adversely impacted by the conflict going forward. These risks may be further heightened if current conflicts expand in scope, or other conflicts arise in other areas of the globe. \nIn addition, we and our Concepts’ franchisees do business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes, which sanctions could be expanded. Any failure to comply with such sanctions or other similar legal requirements could result in the imposition of damages or penalties, the suspension of business licenses, or a cessation of operations at our Concepts’ restaurants, as well as damage to our and our Concepts’ brand images and reputations.\nForeign currency risks and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur results of operations, growth prospects and the value of our assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have had, and may continue to have adverse effects on our reported earnings. More specifically, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, relative to other currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), Australian Dollar, the British Pound and the Euro, as well as currencies in certain other markets have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our reported earnings. Any significant fluctuation in the value of currencies of countries in which we or our Concepts’ franchisees operate, particularly the RMB in China, could materially impact the U.S. dollar value of royalty payments made to us, which could result in lower revenues, could lead to increased costs and lower profitability to us or our Concepts’ franchisees and/or could cause us or our Concepts’ franchisees to increase prices to customers, which could negatively impact sales in these markets and harm our financial results. In addition, the governments in certain countries where our Concepts operate, including China, restrict the conversion of local currency into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of \nthe country. Currency control restrictions on the conversion of other currencies to U.S. dollars or restrictions imposed by countries on cash remittances could cause royalty payments to us to be delayed, remitted only partially or not at all, which could cause us to incur bad debt expense and impact our liquidity.\nRisks Related to Technology, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nAny cybersecurity incident, including the failure to protect the integrity or availability of IT systems or the security of Confidential Information, or the introduction of malware or ransomware, could materially affect our business, financial results and/or our growth prospects and result in substantial costs, litigation, reputational harm and a loss of consumer confidence.\nOur business relies heavily on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online websites, platforms and networks (collectively, “IT Systems”) to support both internal and external, including franchisee-related, operations. We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services. In addition, we and other parties (such as vendors and franchisees), collect, transmit and/or maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our customers, employees, vendors and franchisees, as well as proprietary information pertaining to our business (collectively, “Confidential Information”). The security and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information is critical to our business and regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, certain third-party contracts and industry standards. \nThe current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies, including companies in our industry. The cybersecurity risks we face include cyber-attacks involving ransomware and malicious software, advanced persistent threats, social engineering, credential stuffing or distributed denial-of-service attacks and other attempts by malicious threat actors, including nation-state actors, ransomware groups, and others to access, acquire, use, disclose, misappropriate, shut down or manipulate our information, systems, databases, processes and people. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI and other emerging technologies also may heighten our cybersecurity risks by making cyber-attacks and social engineering more difficult to detect, contain and mitigate. Further, the cybersecurity risks we face have increased in recent years due to an increase in the use of and reliance on our digital commerce platforms and products. Moreover, remote working and personal device use further increases the risk of cyber incidents and the improper dissemination of personal or Confidential Information. \nWe are regularly the target of cyber-attacks and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases. Moreover, given the current cyber threat environment, we expect the volume and intensity of cyber-attacks and attempted intrusions to continue to increase. Despite our security measures, we, and the third parties upon which we rely, have experienced security incidents from time to time and we and such third parties will continue to experience such incidents in the future. In particular, on January 18, 2023, we announced a ransomware attack that impacted certain IT Systems which resulted in the closure of fewer than 300 restaurants in one market for one day, temporarily disrupted certain of our affected systems and resulted in data being taken from our network. As disclosed under Part I, Item 1C of this Form10-K, we remain subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident, including as a result of the data that was taken from the Company’s network and putative class actions filed against us in connection with this incident. \nThere is no assurance that the security measures we take to reduce the risk of such incidents and protect our systems will be sufficient or that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information.\nIf our IT Systems or the information systems of any of our franchisees, or other third parties which we interact, such as suppliers, distributors or third-party delivery providers, are disrupted or compromised, in a manner which impacts us or our IT Systems, as a result of a cyber-attack, data or security breach, or other security incident, or if our employees, franchisees, suppliers or vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or fail to meet contractual and industry standards in connection therewith, any such developments could result in liabilities and penalties, have an adverse impact on our financial results and growth prospects, damage our brands and reputation, cause interruption of normal business operations, cause us to incur substantial costs, result in a loss of consumer confidence and sales and disrupt our supply chain, business and plans. Additionally, such events could result in the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access, acquisition, use or disclosure of data or inability to access data, the release of Confidential Information about our operations and subject us to claims, litigation and government enforcement actions. Moreover, any significant cybersecurity event which impacts us or our IT Systems could require us to devote significant management time and resources to address such events, interfere with our pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and cause us to incur additional expenditures, which could be material, including to investigate such events, remedy cybersecurity problems, recover lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices in response to such events. There is no assurance that any remedial actions will meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our IT Systems, particularly because malicious actors are increasingly \nsophisticated and utilize tools and techniques specifically designed to circumvent security measures, avoid detection and obfuscate forensic evidence, which means we may be unable to identify, investigate or remediate effectively or in a timely manner. Further, we are subject to an increasing number of cybersecurity reporting obligations in different jurisdictions that vary in their scope and application, which may create conflicting reporting obligations and inhibit our ability to quickly provide complete and reliable information about cybersecurity incidents to customers, counterparties, and regulators, as well as the public. Additionally, while we maintain insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, our franchisees may not have insurance coverage (or may have insufficient insurance coverage) designed to cover business interruption losses and/or all types of claims that may arise from cybersecurity risks.\nFurther, the payment card industry sets controls standards used in the transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions. If we or our Concepts’ franchisees fail to comply with the global Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards or fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card and debit card transactions, we or our Concepts’ franchisees may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, fines and assessments from the card brands, and significantly higher credit card and debit card related costs, any of which could adversely affect us.\nThe failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with legal requirements regarding data privacy, data protection and emerging technologies may adversely affect our business and/or growth prospects and subject us to penalties. \nData privacy is subject to frequently changing legal requirements, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions where we and our Concepts’ franchisees do business. We are subject to numerous global laws, including but not limited to, the European Union’s (“E.U.”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulations, which impose strict data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In addition, an increasing number of states and other jurisdictions in the U.S. where we and our Concepts’ franchisees operate have enacted privacy and data protection requirements. Moreover, the U.S. federal government and a significant number of additional states are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term. These and other newly enacted and evolving legal requirements, have required, and may continue to require, us and our Concepts’ franchisees to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. Additionally, state regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities tasked with enforcing new privacy laws are engaging in enforcement investigations and actions. Future enforcement priorities from these bodies may be unclear or changing. While we have established procedures to manage individual privacy requests from consumers and employees intended to ensure compliance with privacy laws, there remains potential residual risk of failure to comply with comprehensive privacy laws passed at the international, federal or state level and this may result in regulatory enforcement action, lawsuits, the imposition of monetary penalties, and damage our reputation. \nThe Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The FTC has also been pursuing privacy as a dedicated enforcement priority, with specialized attorneys seeking enforcement action for violation of US privacy laws including unfair or deceptive practices relating to privacy policies, consumer data collection and processing consent, and digital advertising practices. Moreover, new and changing cross-border data transfer requirements, have required and may continue to require us to incur costs to comply and have impacted the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties. Additionally, we are subject to increasing legal requirements with respect to the use of AI and machine learning applications and tools (including in relation to hiring and employment practices and in digitally marketing our Concepts), data collected from minors, and biometric information. These legal requirements are rapidly changing and are not consistent across jurisdictions, and our inability to adapt to or comply with such legal requirements may adversely impact us, including as the result of liabilities or penalties as the result of any such non-compliance. \nThe increasingly complex, restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international, federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may require significant continued effort and cost, changes to our business practices and impact our ability to obtain and use data to provide personalized experiences for our customers. In addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us and our Concepts’ franchisees to fines, sanctions, governmental investigation, lawsuits and other potential liability, as well as reputational harm.\nUnreliable or inefficient restaurant technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives could adversely impact our business and the overall consumer experience.\nWe and our Concepts’ franchisees rely heavily on IT Systems to efficiently operate our restaurants and drive the customer experience, sales growth and margin improvement, which may be impacted by our initiatives to implement proprietary technology, as well as third-party technology solutions (including, proprietary and third-party, point-of-sale processing \nsolutions in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, and various other processes and procedures), and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience. These IT Systems are subject to damage, interruption or failure due to theft, fire, power outages, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, employee misuse, security breaches, malicious cyber-attacks including the introduction of malware or ransomware or other disruptive behavior by hackers, or other catastrophic events. If our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ IT Systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions, which could result in lost sales, customer or employee dissatisfaction, or negative publicity that could adversely impact our reputation, growth prospects, and financial results.\nMoreover, our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological advancements and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. If our Concepts’ digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, privacy, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact us and our Concepts’ franchisees. Developing and implementing consumers’ evolving technology demands may place a significant financial burden on us and our Concepts’ franchisees, and our Concepts’ franchisees may have differing views on investment priorities. Our strategic digital and technology initiatives may not be implemented timely or may not achieve the desired results. Failure to adequately manage implementations, updates or enhancements of new technology or interfaces between platforms could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and disrupt and otherwise adversely impact our operations and/or growth prospects. It may be difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts due to intense competition for developers necessary to innovate, develop and implement new technologies for us. Even if we effectively implement and manage these technology initiatives, there is no guarantee that this will result in sales growth or margin improvement. \nIn particular, we are currently allocating significant resources to accelerate our digital, technology, and innovation capabilities, and as part of this process we have been developing and/or implementing various AI initiatives. The development of such AI initiatives is complex and uncertain, and presents various risks and uncertainties, including as the result of the rapidly evolving legal, regulatory and ethical landscape associated with the use of AI. If we were to fail to successfully or effectively implement AI initiatives, or we encounter other deficiencies or failures in our AI systems or initiatives, this could put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in legal and regulatory risk, and brand or reputational harm.\nCertain IT Systems which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties may also be unreliable or inefficient, and technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance, which could impact the reliability of critical systems’ operations. Further, if there are issues with the proprietary technology, we may be subject to liability or financial penalties to our Concepts’ franchisees.\nMoreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve and we cannot predict consumer or team member acceptance of these existing and new technologies (e.g. automation, AI, new delivery channels) or their impact on our business, and/or our growth prospects, nor can we be certain of our ability to implement or execute such technologies, which could result in loss of sales; dissatisfaction from our customers, employees, or employees of our Concepts’ franchisees; or negative publicity that could adversely impact our reputation or financial results. \nThere are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce and delivery platforms to maintain and grow sales. \nCustomers are increasingly using our internally-owned e-commerce websites and apps, such as kfc.com, tacobell.com, pizzahut.com, habitburger.com, and the KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and the Habit Burger & Grill apps in several geographies, including the U.S. Our customers also increasingly utilize alternative methods of digital ordering and delivery technology, including apps owned by third-party delivery aggregators and third-party developers and payment processors, to order, pay for and have delivered our Concepts’ products. As a result, our Concepts and our Concepts’ franchisees are increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel and our business and/or growth prospects could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement, execute or maintain our consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as delivery, curbside pick-up and mobile carryout, or are otherwise unable to effectively adapt to developments associated with alternative methods of delivery, including advances in digital ordering and delivery technology, autonomous vehicle delivery, and changes in consumer behavior resulting from these developments. \nIf the third-party aggregators that we utilize for delivery, including marketplace and delivery as a service, cease or curtail their operations, fail to maintain sufficient labor force to satisfy demand, provide poor customer service, materially change fees, access or visibility to our products, or give greater priority or promotions to our competitors, our business may be negatively impacted. In addition, third-party delivery services typically charge restaurants a per order fee, and as such utilizing third-party delivery services may not be as profitable as sales directly to our customers, and may also introduce food quality and customer \nsatisfaction risks outside of our control. The third-party delivery business is also the subject of increased scrutiny from regulators, which may result in additional costs and expenses that the third-party delivery businesses and aggregators may seek to pass through to participating restaurants or otherwise adversely impact such restaurants. These digital ordering and payment platforms used in connection with our restaurants also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage, inclement weather or natural disasters and have experienced, and may continue to experience, interruptions limiting or delaying customers’ ability to order through such platforms and potentially making customers less inclined to return to such platforms. The rapid acceleration in growth of digital sales has placed additional stress on those platforms that are more reliant upon legacy technology, such as certain platforms used by Pizza Hut, which may result in more frequent and potentially more severe interruptions. Moreover, our reliance on multiple digital commerce platforms to support our global footprint, multiple Concepts and highly franchised business model could increase our vulnerability to cyber-attacks and/or security breaches and could necessitate additional expenditures as we endeavor to consolidate and standardize such platforms. \nYum China, our largest franchisee, utilizes third-party mobile payment apps such as Alipay, WeChat Pay and Union Pay as a means through which to generate sales and process payments. Should customers become unable to access mobile payment apps in China, should the relationship between Yum China and one or more third-party mobile payment processors become interrupted, or should Yum China’s ability to use Alipay, WeChat Pay, Union Pay or other third-party mobile payment apps in its operations be restricted, its business could be adversely affected, which could have a negative impact on the license fee paid to us.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the increased impact of social media could adversely impact our business and/or growth prospects.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. Many social media platforms immediately publish content, often without filters or checks on accuracy. Information posted on such platforms may be adverse to our interests and/or may be inaccurate. The dissemination of information online could harm our reputation, business and/or growth prospects, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The damage may be immediate without an opportunity for redress or correction. \nIn addition, social media is frequently used by our Concepts or Concepts’ franchisees to communicate with customers and the public. Failure by our Concepts or Concepts’ franchisees to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our Concepts’ competitors, could lead to a decline in brand reputation, brand value, customer visits and revenue. Social media is also increasingly used to compel companies to express public positions on issues and topics not directly related to their core business, which could prove controversial or divisive to consumers and result in lost sales or a misallocation of resources. In addition, laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, are rapidly evolving to govern social media platforms and communications. A failure of us, our employees, our Concepts’ franchisees or third parties acting at our direction or on our behalf, or others perceived to be associated with us or our Concepts’ franchisees, to abide by applicable laws and regulations regarding the use of social media, or to appropriately use social media, could adversely impact our Concepts’ brands, our reputation and our business, result in negative publicity, or subject us or our Concepts’ franchisees to fines, other penalties or litigation. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our Concepts’ brands, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information. Further, with the increase in the use of AI and social media outlets, adverse publicity impacting a company, whether warranted or not, can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context or vetting for accuracy, making it increasingly difficult for companies to effectively respond.\nFailure to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property could harm our Concepts’ brands and overall business and/or growth prospects.\nWe regard our registered trademarks (e.g., Yum®, KFC®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut® and The Habit®), unregistered trademarks, copyrightable works, inventions, software, domain names, and trade secrets related to our restaurant businesses as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. Our trademarks, many of which are registered in various jurisdictions, create brand awareness and help build goodwill among our customers. \nWe rely on a combination of legal protections provided by trademark registrations, contracts, copyrights, patents and common law rights, such as unfair competition, passing off and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property from potential infringement. However, from time to time, we become aware of other persons or companies using names and marks that are \nidentical or confusingly similar to our brands’ names and marks, or using other proprietary intellectual property we own. Although our policy is to challenge infringements and other unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, certain or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks and other intellectual property could diminish the value of our Concepts’ brands and adversely affect our business and goodwill. \nIn addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our Concepts have, or may in the future open or franchise, a restaurant and the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or the legal protections that may be available will be adequate or that our Concepts’ franchisees will maintain the quality of the goods and services offered under our brands’ trademarks or always act in accordance with guidelines we set for maintaining our brands’ intellectual property rights and defending or enforcing our trademarks and other intellectual property could result in significant expenditures. \nOur brands may also be targets of infringement claims that could interfere with the use of certain names, trademarks, works of authorship, and/or the proprietary know-how, inventions, recipes, or trade secrets used in our business. Defending against such claims can be costly, and as a result of defending such claims, we may be prohibited from using such intellectual property or proprietary information in the future or forced to pay damages, royalties, or other fees for using such proprietary information, any of which could negatively affect our business, growth prospects, reputation and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain and Employment\nShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food, equipment and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nThe products sold or used by our Concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers although certain products and equipment have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. We, along with our Concepts’ franchisees, are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products, equipment and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices. We have experienced from time to time, and may continue to experience, supply chain disruptions and shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of food items, equipment and other supplies to our Concepts’ restaurants, which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business. Future shortages or disruptions could also be caused by factors such as natural disasters, health epidemics and pandemics, social unrest, the impacts of climate change, inaccurate forecasting of customer demand, problems in production or distribution, restrictions on imports or exports including due to trade disputes or restrictions, the inability of vendors to obtain credit, political instability in the countries in which the suppliers and distributors are located, the financial instability of suppliers and distributors, suppliers’ or distributors’ failure to meet our standards or requirements, transitioning to new suppliers or distributors, product quality issues or recalls, inflation, labor unrest or work stoppages, food safety warnings or advisories, the cancellation of supply or distribution agreements or an inability to renew such arrangements or to find replacements on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, in the U.S., the Company and the Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchisee groups are members of Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (“RSCS”), which is a third party responsible for purchasing certain restaurant products and equipment. Habit Burger & Grill entered into a purchasing agreement with RSCS in 2020. RSCS manages our relationship with McLane Foodservice, Inc. (“McLane”) which serves as the largest distributor for the Company’s KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Concepts in the U.S. RSCS and McLane both have certain contractual rights to terminate the relevant distribution contract upon a specified notice period. Any failure or inability of our significant suppliers or distributors to meet their respective service requirements or any termination of relevant agreements without a notice period sufficient to enable an appropriate transition, could result in shortages or interruptions in the availability of food and other supplies.\nThe loss of key personnel, labor shortages and increased labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss or failure to engage in adequate succession planning of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business and/or our growth prospects.\nIn addition, our restaurant operations are highly service-oriented, and our success depends in part on our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ ability to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees, including franchisee management, restaurant managers and other crew members. Our Concepts and their franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience increased labor shortages and employee turnover at many restaurants and increased competition for qualified employees, given ongoing challenging labor market conditions. These labor market conditions and the ongoing inflationary environment in markets where we operate have increased in recent years, and may continue to increase, the labor costs for our \nConcepts and their franchisees, including due to the payment of higher wages to attract or retain qualified employees (including franchisee management, restaurant managers and other crew members) and due to increased overtime costs to meet demand. Moreover, there may be a long-term trend toward higher wages in emerging markets as well as various other markets. In addition, increases in labor costs have also been driven by, and may continue to be driven by regulatory requirements to raise minimum wages, including in connection with the increases in minimum wages that have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, effective April 1, 2024, California's Assembly Bill No. 1228 (“AB 1228”) raised the minimum wage to $20 an hour beginning April 2024 for workers at quick service restaurants in the state that are part of brands that have more than 60 establishments nationwide. AB 1228 also created an advisory-only council with powers to enact additional minimum wage increases and to recommend that state agencies enact additional health, safety and employment standards for quick service restaurants. AB 1228 has increased, and is expected to continue to increase the operating costs for our Concepts’ restaurants in California, and may otherwise adversely impact and disrupt our operations in California.\nThe inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals at the store level, coupled with increased labor rates, may result in reduced operating hours, have a negative impact on service or customer experience, delay our planned use, development or deployment of technology, impact planned openings of new restaurants, or result in closures of existing restaurants by us and our Concepts’ franchisees, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our Concepts and their franchisees have been, and will continue to be, subject to the risk of increasing union activity in the restaurant space. In the event of a strike, work slowdown or other labor unrest, the ability to adequately staff at the store level could be impaired, which could adversely impact our operations and distract management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities. \nAn increase in food prices and other operating costs may have an adverse impact on our business and/or our growth prospects.\nOur and our Concepts’ franchisees’ businesses depend on reliable sources of large quantities of raw materials such as proteins (including poultry, pork, beef and seafood), cheese, oil, flour and vegetables (including potatoes and lettuce). Raw materials purchased for use in our Concepts’ restaurants are subject to price volatility caused by fluctuations in aggregate supply and demand, or other external conditions, such as weather and climate conditions, (which may be exacerbated by climate change), energy costs or natural events or disasters that affect expected harvests of such raw materials, taxes and tariffs (including potential tariffs or other adverse impacts resulting from restrictive trade policies or trade disputes), industry demand, inflationary conditions, labor shortages, transportation issues, fuel costs, food safety concerns, product recalls, governmental regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable. While inflationary conditions have somewhat abated in recent periods, we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience, an increase in the price of various raw materials and other operating costs (such as rent and energy costs) as well as increased volatility in such prices and costs, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors.\nWe and/or our Concepts’ franchisees have taken, and may continue to take, certain actions as a result of inflationary increases in food and other operating costs noted above, including by increasing food prices beyond typical pricing patterns at certain of our Concepts’ restaurants, attempting to negotiate favorable pricing terms with our suppliers and/or shifting to suppliers with more favorable pricing where feasible, and utilizing forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices. However, because we and our Concepts’ franchisees provide competitively priced food, we have not always been able to pass through to our customers the full amount of our cost increases or otherwise fully mitigate the cost increases experienced by us or our Concepts’ franchisees. If we and our Concepts’ franchisees are unable to manage the cost of raw materials or to increase the prices of products proportionately, our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ profit margins and return on invested capital may be adversely impacted. Moreover, many customers at our Concepts’ restaurants are sensitive to price increases, and to the extent that we raise menu prices to offset these costs, this could result in decreased consumer demand and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Concepts’ Brands and Reputation\nOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability and our Concepts’ franchisees’ ability to maintain and enhance our corporate reputation and the value and perception of our brands, and a key aspect of our growth strategy is based on enhancing the perception of our restaurant brands. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions regarding a variety of subjective factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, our ingredients, food safety, our business practices, including with respect to how we source commodities, and our pricing (including price increases and discounting). Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that may affect perceptions of our \nConcepts’ brands generally or relative to alternatives. The retail food industry has also been subject to scrutiny and claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues, such as weight gain and other adverse effects. Publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick service and fast-casual segments of the retail food industry) may harm our Concepts’ reputations and adversely affect our business. Moreover, this scrutiny could lead to increased regulation of the content or marketing of our products, including legislation or regulation taxing and/or regulating food with high-fat, sugar and salt content, or foods otherwise deemed to be “unhealthy,” which may increase costs of compliance and remediation to us and our Concepts’ franchisees. Additionally, if the demand for offerings at our Concepts’ restaurants and other fast-casual or quick service segments of the retail food industry decreases or shifts as a result of wellness trends or changing dietary preferences, including as a result of developments in or increased adoption of weight loss medications, our business and/or financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, business or other incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our Concepts’ restaurants, franchisees, competitors, governments, suppliers or distributors, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer perception, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or investigations. For example, the reputation of our Concepts’ brands could be damaged by negative publicity, or claims or perceptions (whether real or perceived) regarding the quality, safety or reputation of our products, suppliers, distributors or franchisees; that we, founders of our Concepts, our Concepts’ franchisees or other business partners have acted or are acting in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased or socially irresponsible manner, are not fostering an equitable, inclusive and diverse environment or have an actual or perceived allegiance towards one community over another, including with respect to the service and treatment of customers at our Concepts’ restaurants, and our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ treatment of employees; Company action or brand imagery; misconduct by any of our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ employees; utilization of emerging technologies such as AI; or a real or perceived failure of corporate governance. Any such developments could adversely impact the perception of our Concepts’ brands or our products, reduce consumer demand for our products or otherwise adversely impact us.\nWe cannot guarantee that franchisees or other third parties with licenses to use our intellectual property will not take actions that may harm the value of our intellectual property. Whilst franchisee use of our Concepts’ trademarks are governed through franchise agreements and we monitor use of our trademarks by both franchisees and third parties, franchisees or other third parties may use our trademarks in ways, or may refer to or make statements about our Concepts’ brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations, that improperly alter trademarks or branding, or that are critical of our Concepts’ brands or place our Concepts’ brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation. Moreover, unauthorized third parties, including our Concepts’ current and former franchisees, may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our Concepts’ brands, resulting in consumer confusion or brand dilution. \nOur ability to reach consumers and drive results is heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and our ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences, including developing and launching new and innovative products and offerings. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be as successful as intended, or may not be as successful as our competitors, which may adversely affect our reputation and business. In addition, any decisions we may make to collaborate or cease to collaborate with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers, and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial results.\nWe and our Concepts’ franchisees are subject to heightened and evolving expectations and requirements with respect to social and environmental sustainability matters, which expose us and our Concepts’ franchisees to numerous risks.\nThere has been an increased focus, including from investors, the public and governmental and nongovernmental authorities, on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, such as climate change, greenhouse gases, packaging and waste, human rights, diversity, sustainable supply chain practices, animal health and welfare, deforestation, land, energy and water use and other corporate responsibility matters. At the same time, other stakeholders and regulators have increasingly expressed or pursued opposing views, legislation and investment expectation with respect to sustainability initiatives, including so-called anti-ESG legislation or policies. Further, we and our Concepts’ franchisees are and may become subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by governmental and self-regulatory organizations with respect to ESG matters. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and management focus associated with satisfying such regulations and expectations. As a result of these expectations and evolving requirements, as well as our commitment to social and environmental sustainability matters, we may continue to establish or expand goals, commitments or targets, and take actions to meet such goals, commitments and targets. These goals could be difficult and expensive to implement for us and our Concepts’ franchisees, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we or our Concepts’ franchisees may be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of disclosures. Further, these goals may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, assumptions that are subject to change, and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. If our or our Concepts’ franchisees’ data, processes and \nreporting with respect to social and environmental matters are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we or our Concepts’ franchisees fail to achieve progress with respect to these goals on a timely basis, consumer and investor trust in our brands may suffer. In addition, some third parties (including ESG groups) may object to the scope or nature of our social and environmental program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these initiatives or goals (or those of our Concepts’ franchisees), which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative actions) or consumers (such as boycotts, lawsuits or negative publicity campaigns) that could adversely affect us or our brand value.\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change.\nWe could be adversely affected by the physical and/or transitional effects of climate change. Our and our franchisees’ properties and operations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which is predicted to result in ongoing changes in global weather patterns and more frequent and severe weather-related events such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. Such adverse weather-related impacts may also adversely affect the general economy in countries where we operate, disrupt our operations, cause restaurant closures or delay the opening of new restaurants, adversely impact our supply chain and increase the costs of (and decrease the availability of) food and other supplies needed for our operations. In addition, various legislative and regulatory efforts to combat climate change may increase in the future, which could result in additional taxes, increased compliance costs, and otherwise disrupt and adversely impact us and our franchisees.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Litigation\nWe may be subject to litigation that could adversely affect us by increasing our expenses, diverting management attention or subjecting us to significant monetary damages and other remedies.\nWe are regularly involved in legal proceedings, which include regulatory claims or disputes by claimants such as franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers, governments and others related to operational, commercial, foreign exchange, tax, franchise, contractual or employment issues. These claims or disputes may relate to personal injury, employment, real estate, environmental, tort, intellectual property, false advertising, breach of contract, technology services, data privacy, securities, consumer protection, derivative and other litigation matters. See the discussion of legal proceedings in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Plaintiffs often seek recovery of large or indeterminate amounts, and lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control). We may also be adversely affected by unfavorable rulings or developments in cases we are not involved in. Moreover, regardless of whether any such lawsuits have merit, or whether we are ultimately held liable or settle, such litigation may be expensive to defend, may divert resources and management attention, and may negatively impact our financial results. With respect to insured claims, a judgment for damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our Concepts’ reputations, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in, or non-compliance with, legal requirements may adversely affect our business operations, growth prospects or financial condition.\nThe Company, and our Concepts and their franchisees, are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world. These laws and regulations change regularly and are increasingly complex. For example, we are subject to:\n•The Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. and similar laws that provide protection to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.\n•Various laws related to employment, including the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act and similar laws, which govern matters such as minimum wages, and overtime; the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act and similar laws which provide protected leave rights to employees and laws related to workplace health and safety, meal and rest breaks, non-discrimination, non-harassment, whistleblower protections, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n•Laws and regulations in government-mandated health care benefits such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S.\n•Laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety, product marketing and menu labeling.\n•Laws relating to state and local licensing.\n•Laws relating to the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.\n•Laws and regulations relating to health, sanitation, food, workplace safety, child labor, including laws regulating the use of certain “hazardous equipment”, building and zoning, and fire safety and prevention.\n•Laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities.\n•Laws relating to information and data security, privacy, cashless payments, consumer protection, and the use of AI and other emerging technologies.\n•Laws relating to our use of third party aggregators.\n•Laws relating to currency conversion or exchange.\n•Laws relating to international trade and sanctions.\n•Anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n•Environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.\n•Federal and state immigration laws and regulations in the U.S.\n•Public company compliance, disclosure and governance matters.\nWe may also be adversely impacted by legal developments resulting in broader standards for determining when two or more entities may be found to be joint employers of the same employees under laws such as the National Labor Relations Act (the “NLRA”). In this regard, a rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) in 2023 addressing the joint-employer test under the NLRA, which would have provided for more expansive joint employer standards, is not in effect after having been vacated by a federal district court in 2024. However, if any governmental authority such as the NLRB were to adopt and implement a broader joint employer standard in the future under laws such as the NLRA in a manner that was determined to be applicable to franchise relationships, we or our Concepts could be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations and could be required to engage in collective bargaining with representatives of the employees of our Concepts’ franchisees. In addition to the foregoing, many states (including California) have enacted or are considering legislation regarding, or otherwise increased their focus on, the misclassification of independent contractors, which could have an adverse impact on and disrupt the operations of our Concepts' restaurants in other ways, such as costs relating to delivery aggregators or certain staff augmentation models. \nAny failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or related standards or guidelines, or publicity associated therewith, could adversely affect our reputation, global expansion efforts, growth prospects and financial results or result in, among other things, litigation, revocation of required licenses, internal investigations, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, the compliance costs associated with complying with new or existing legal requirements could be substantial.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, disagreements with taxing authorities, imposition of new taxes and our restructurings could impact our financial results and growth prospects. \nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes in various jurisdictions. Our accruals for tax liabilities are based on past experience, interpretations of applicable law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. Such tax positions require significant judgment which may be incorrect or challenged by tax authorities and may result in payments greater than the amounts accrued. If the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, which could be material. For example, as disclosed in Note 20, as a result of an audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, in August 2022, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report that includes a proposed adjustment for the 2014 fiscal year relating to a series of reorganizations we undertook during that year in connection with the business realignment of our corporate and management reporting structure along brand lines. While we disagree with the position of the IRS and intend to contest it vigorously, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material, adverse impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nIn addition, if jurisdictions in which we or our Concepts operate enact tax legislation, modify tax treaties and/or increase audit scrutiny, it could increase our taxes and have an adverse impact on our financial results and growth prospects. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”), the E.U. and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have enacted or committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed in an effort to limit perceived base erosion and profit shifting incentives. In particular, the OECD’s Pillar Two initiative provides for a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis. These proposals have been or are expected to be implemented in many jurisdictions in which we operate, and we anticipate an increase in the burdens related to the tax compliance and reporting costs as a result of these developments. \nRisks Related to the Yum China Spin-Off\nThe Yum China spin-off and certain related transactions could result in substantial U.S. tax liability.\nWe received opinions of outside counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Yum China spin-off and certain related transactions qualified as generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 361 of the U.S. Internal Revenue \nCode. The opinions relied on various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations as to factual matters and undertakings (including with respect to future conduct) made by Yum China and us. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we may not be able to rely on these opinions of outside counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions of outside counsel, the conclusions reached in the tax opinions may be challenged by the IRS. Because the opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will not prevail in any such challenge.\nIf, notwithstanding receipt of any opinion, the IRS were to conclude that the Yum China spin-off was taxable, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the Yum China common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value. In addition, each U.S. holder of our Common Stock who received shares of Yum China common stock in connection with the spin-off transaction would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of Yum China common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such U.S. stockholder as a dividend to the extent of accumulated earnings and profits as of the date of the spin-off. For each such U.S. stockholder, any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in our shares of Common Stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain.\nThe Yum China spin-off may be subject to China’s indirect transfer tax.\nIn February 2015, the Chinese State Tax Administration (“STA”) issued the Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (“Bulletin 7”). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (“Chinese interests”), by a non-resident enterprise, may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the STA may treat an indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer has avoided Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise. We evaluated the potential applicability of Bulletin 7 in connection with the Separation in the form of a tax free restructuring and continue to believe it is more likely than not that Bulletin 7 does not apply and that the restructuring had reasonable commercial purpose.\nHowever, there are significant uncertainties on what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose, how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the Chinese tax authorities will ultimately view the spin-off. As a result, our position could be challenged by the Chinese tax authorities resulting in a tax at a rate of 10% assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of Yum China at the date of the spin-off. As our tax basis in Yum China was minimal, the amount of such a tax could be significant and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, growth prospects and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Consumer Discretionary Spending and Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur business may be adversely impacted by changes in consumer discretionary spending and macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, in markets in which we operate. \nAs a company dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, we (and our Concepts’ franchisees) are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consumer discretionary spending levels in markets where we and our Concepts’ franchisees operate. Some of the factors that may impact discretionary consumer spending and macroeconomic conditions include unemployment and underemployment rates, fluctuations in disposable income, the price of gasoline, other inflationary pressures, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, elevated interest rate levels, stock market performance and changes in consumer confidence and cost consciousness. In this regard, we and our Concepts’ franchisees have been adversely impacted by, and may continue to be adversely impacted by, negative macroeconomic conditions in certain markets where we and our Concepts’ franchisees operate, including impacts from increased commodity prices and other inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, challenging labor market conditions, ongoing geopolitical instability, changes in political conditions, supply chain disruption, and increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets. Any significant deterioration in current negative macroeconomic conditions in markets where we operate, or any recovery therefrom that is significantly slower than anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. In addition, negative macroeconomic conditions or other adverse business developments may result in future asset impairment charges. Moreover, if negative macroeconomic conditions result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets, or negatively impact our credit ratings, our cost of borrowing, our ability to access capital on favorable terms and our overall liquidity and capital structure could be adversely impacted. \nRisks Related to Competition\nThe retail food industry is highly competitive.\nOur Concepts’ restaurants compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, and the industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, digital engagement, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service reputation, restaurant location and attractiveness and maintenance of properties, management and hourly personnel and qualified franchisees. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully respond to changing consumer or dietary preferences, if our marketing efforts and/or launch of new products are unsuccessful, or if our Concepts’ restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets, our and our Concepts’ franchisees’ businesses and/or our growth prospects could be adversely affected. We also face ongoing competition due to convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes. Competition has also increased from and been enabled by delivery aggregators and other food delivery services in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas, and such competition is expected to continue to increase. Finally, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals comparable to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. Increased competition and other competitive factors could have an adverse effect on our business or development plans.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness makes us more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, may limit our ability to plan for or respond to significant changes in our business, and requires a significant amount of cash to service our debt payment obligations that we may be unable to generate or obtain. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our total outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt was approximately $11.4 billion. Subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we may incur additional debt from time to time, which would increase the risks related to our level of indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could have important potential consequences, including, but not limited to:\n•increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to, adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment;\n•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing or eliminating the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases or other corporate purposes;\n•increasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets;\n•restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates;\n•increasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest or we are forced to refinance indebtedness at higher interest rates, which risks are heightened by the current elevated interest rate environment;\n•increasing our exposure to the risk of discontinuance, replacement or modification of certain reference rates;\n•making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our debt obligations;\n•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; \n•imposing restrictive covenants on our operations due to the terms of our indebtedness, which, if not complied with, could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies; and\n•increasing our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future debt or equity financings are not available to us on acceptable terms in amounts sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs, our financial condition may be adversely affected. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and financial condition.",
