      "text": "Item 1.    Business\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. We believe we are a leading:\n•global oilseed processor and producer of vegetable oils and protein meals, based on processing capacity;\n•global grain processor, based on volume;\n•seller of packaged plant-based oils worldwide, based on sales; and\n•producer and seller of wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products in North and South America, based on volume. \nWe conduct our operations via four reportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments and are classified as Corporate and Other.\nWe further organize these reportable segments into Core operations and Non-core operations. Core operations comprise our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments.\nOur Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business principally involved in the purchase, storage, transportation, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Our Agribusiness operations and assets are located in North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and we have merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.\nThe Refined and Specialty Oils segment includes businesses that sell vegetable oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, specialty ingredients, and renewable diesel feedstocks. The operations and assets of our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are primarily located in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. \nThe Milling segment includes businesses that sell wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products. The operations and assets of our Milling segment are located in North and South America. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico.\nNon-core operations includes our Sugar and Bioenergy segment, which was primarily comprised of our previously owned 50% interest in the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture. On October 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia to BP Biofuels Brazil Investment Limited (\"BP\").\nPending Business Combination with Viterra Limited \nOn June 13, 2023, Bunge Limited entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement\") with Viterra and its shareholders, including certain affiliates of Glencore PLC (\"Glencore\"), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPP Investments\"), and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (\"BCI\") (collectively, the \"Viterra Shareholder Group\"), to acquire Viterra in a stock and cash transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). Bunge Limited shareholders approved the Acquisition at an extraordinary general meeting held on October 5, 2023. \nViterra operates a leading network of agricultural storage, processing and transport assets connecting producers to consumers with sustainable, traceable and quality-controlled agricultural products. The Acquisition is expected to create an innovative global agribusiness company well-positioned to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets and better serve farmers and end-customers.\nPursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the Viterra Shareholder Group are anticipated to receive approximately 65.6 million of registered shares of Bunge, with an aggregate value of approximately $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 and receive approximately $2.0 billion in cash (collectively, the \"Transaction Consideration\"), in return for 100% of the outstanding equity of Viterra. The determination of the final value of the Transaction Consideration will depend on the Company’s share price at the time of closing. Upon completion of the transaction, the Viterra Shareholder Group are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023.\nThe Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Acquisition is expected to receive the remaining regulatory approvals and close in the next few months. The Business \nCombination Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties and includes certain customary termination rights. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, Bunge would be obligated to pay the Viterra Shareholder Group a fee of $400 million in the aggregate.\nHistory and Corporate Information\nWe trace our history back to 1818 when we were founded as a trading company in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. \nBunge Global is incorporated under Swiss law as a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) and domiciled in Geneva, Switzerland. The change of the jurisdiction of incorporation of our group holding company from Bermuda to Switzerland was completed on November 1, 2023. In connection with the Redomestication, the shareholders of Bunge Limited became, on a one-for-one basis, the holders of all the issued and outstanding registered shares of Bunge Global. \nBunge Global is recorded in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Geneva with enterprise registration number CHE-318.451.510. Our registered office and principal executive offices are located at Route de Florissant 13, 1206 Geneva, Switzerland. Our corporate headquarters is located at 1391 Timberlake Manor Parkway, Chesterfield, Missouri, 63017, United States of America, and our telephone number is (314) 292-2000.\nCore Segments\nAgribusiness Segment\nOverview—Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing, and selling agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various value chains. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola, and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biofuel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 31% of our processing capacity located in North America, 27% in South America, 25% in Europe and 17% in Asia-Pacific.\nRecent Acquisitions—On October 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with CJ CheilJedang Corporation and STIC CJ Global Investment Corporate Partnership Private Equity Fund to acquire 100% of outstanding equity of CJ Latam Participações Ltda. and CJ Selecta S.A. (collectively, \"CJ\"). Operations of CJ primarily consist of an oilseed processing facility located in Brazil. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCustomers—We sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains, and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers, and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment are our own refined and specialty oils businesses, third-party edible oil processors, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, and the food processor and retail markets, as well as biofuel companies, which use the oil as feedstock for biofuel production.\nDistribution and Logistics—We have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges, and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Latvia, Ukraine, France, Poland, Vietnam, and Australia.\nFinancial Services and Activities—We offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services, to customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations primarily leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage commodity price risk exposures. We also engage in foreign exchange and other financial instrument trading via our financial services business. Additionally, we provide financing services to farmers, primarily in Brazil, from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations.\nBiodiesel—We own and operate conventional biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil and have equity method investments in conventional biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core \nAgribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (refined or partially refined vegetable oil) used in their production processes. \nRaw Materials—We purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies, and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs.\nCompetition—Due to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings, and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: Archer Daniels Midland Co. (\"ADM\"), Cargill Incorporated (\"Cargill\"), Louis Dreyfus Company B.V., Wilmar International Limited (\"Wilmar\"), and COFCO International.\nRefined and Specialty Oils Segment\nOverview—We primarily sell our refined and specialty oil products to food processors, food service companies, renewable diesel producers, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are various crude and further processed vegetable oils and fats. These raw materials are mostly agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies among our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high-quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from global population and income growth rates. Additionally, our businesses that sell vegetable oils as feedstock to the renewable diesel industry generally benefit from increased emphasis on environmental sustainability, including government incentives and mandates aimed at increasing the percentage of fuels stemming from renewable sources, and increased production from the renewable diesel industry.\nRecent Acquisitions—In April 2023, Bunge, through our 80% ownership of the Bunge Loders Croklaan (\"Loders\") joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad, completed our purchase of a port-based refinery located in Avondale, Louisiana in the United States. The facility has multi-oil refining capabilities and provides a scalable, complementary addition to our North America footprint. In 2024, we broke ground on a project to expand the facility’s production capacity.\nProducts—Our refined and specialty oil products include packaged and bulk oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, renewable diesel feedstocks, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment processing operations as raw materials in this business. We also refine and fractionate palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter, and blend and refine olive oil. Additionally, we produce specialty ingredients derived from vegetable oils, such as lecithin, which is used as an emulsifier in a broad range of food products. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales. We have refined and specialty oils refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Our refined and specialty oils business comprises our wholly-owned refined oils business in North America, other business to business (\"B2B\") and business to consumer (\"B2C\") refined and specialty oils offerings in South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and our 80% ownership interest in our Loders joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad.\nIn Brazil, our retail edible oil brands include Soya, the leading consumer packaged vegetable oil brand, as well as Salada. Further, we are a leading supplier of shortenings to the food processor market.\nIn the United States and Canada, we primarily provide product offerings to food processors and food service companies, and we sell refined vegetable oils as feedstock to the renewable diesel industry. Specifically, we offer food manufacturers, bakeries, confectionaries, and food service operators high-quality solutions to fit their goals, such as delivering desired tastes and textures, or reducing saturated fats in their products. Our products include trans-fat free high-oleic canola oil, which is low in saturated fats, and high-oleic soybean oil, which is highly stable and trans-fat free. We have also developed proprietary fiber addition processes that allow bakery and food processor customers to achieve significant saturated fat reductions in shortenings. We also produce margarines and buttery spreads, including our leading Country Premium brand, for food service, food processor and retail private label customers. \nIn Europe, we are a leader in consumer packaged vegetable oils, which are sold in various geographies under brand names including Venusz, Floriol, Kujawski, Unisol, Kaliakra, Oleina, Oliwier, Komili and Kirlangic. We are also a leader in margarines, under brand names including Smakowita, Slynne, Maslo Rosline, Masmix, Optima, Finuu, Deli Reform, Keiju, Alentaia, Venusz, Evesol, Carlshamn, Voimix, Eleplant and Beleaf. Additionally, we produce a variety of products for the confectionery and bakery industries. We are also an oils supplier in the Western European food service channel.\nIn Asia, we offer a range of consumer products and offerings, including bakery, culinary, confectionary, and human nutrition products. In India, our consumer brands include Dalda, Gagan, Fiona and Chambal edible oils; Dalda and Gagan\nvanaspatis; and Masterline professional bakery fats.\nCustomers—Our customers include baked goods companies, snack food producers, confectioners, restaurant chains, food service operators, human nutrition companies, other food manufacturers who use vegetable oils and shortenings as ingredients in their operations, and renewable diesel producers. Other customers include grocery chains, wholesalers, distributors, and other retailers who sell to consumers either under our own brand names or private labels. These customers include global and national food processors and manufacturers, many of which are leading brand owners in their product categories.\nCompetition—Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, raw material procurement, distribution capability, cost structure, brand recognition, product quality, product innovation, technical support, composition and nutritional value, and advertising and promotion. Our products may compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. Our principal competitors in the Refined and Specialty Oils segment include, but are not limited to: ADM, AAK AB, Cargill, Fuji Oil Co. Ltd., and Wilmar, as well as local competitors in each region.\nMilling Segment\nOverview—We primarily sell our milling products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service companies, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our milling businesses are wheat, corn, and other agricultural commodities sourced from our Agribusiness segment or directly from third parties. Similar to our refined and specialty oils business, we realize synergies among our other segments in areas such as raw material procurement, logistics, risk management, and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Milling segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from macro population and income growth rates. Additionally, our Milling segment is focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors, and increases in snacking and eating outside the home. \nProducts—Our Milling segment activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours and bakery mixes in Brazil, as well as corn-based products derived from both the dry and wet corn milling processes in the United States and Mexico. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico.\nOur brands in Brazil include Suprema, Soberana, Farina, Predileta, and Bem-fácill wheat flours, Pre-Mescla, BTX, and Bem-fácill bakery premixes. Our corn milling products primarily consist of dry-milled corn meals and flours, flaking and brewers' grits, soy-fortified corn meal, corn-soy blends, snack grits and meals, and other similar products. As part of our corn portfolio, we also sell whole grain and fiber ingredients in addition to wet-milled masa flours, some sold under the El Maizal brand in the United States. Additionally, we offer organic and non-GMO products in the United States, including corn varieties. \nCustomers—The primary customers for our wheat milling products are food processing, bakery, and food service companies. The primary customers for our corn milling products are companies in the food-processing sector, such as cereal, snack, bakery, brewing, and food service companies; industrial manufacturing companies; and the U.S. Government under its humanitarian assistance programs. \nCompetition—Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, raw material procurement, brand recognition, product quality, nutritional profile, dietary trends, and distribution capabilities. In Brazil, our major competitors are M. Dias Branco, J. Macedo, Moinho Anaconda, and Grande Moinho Cearense, as well as many small regional producers. Our major competitors in North American corn milling include Cargill, Didion Inc., SEMO Milling, LLC, Life Line Foods, LLC, and Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. \nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to our individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by our chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nNon-core Segment\nSugar and Bioenergy Segment\nOur Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprised our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, which was our joint venture with BP, as well as minor ethanol distribution sales activity. On October 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia to BP. \nThe joint venture was formed to cultivate sugar cane, produce and sell sugar and sugar ethanol, and create power cogeneration activities. The sugar produced at BP Bunge Bioenergia’s mills was sold in both the Brazilian domestic market, primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries, and export markets. The ethanol was sold primarily to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet demand for fuel, and also exported in the international market. \nBP Bunge Bioenergia operated on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. We accounted for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia for the period during which we had an interest in the joint venture. As our long-term goal has been to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture, the operations are designated as Non-core in the period prior to the sale. \nRisk Management\nRisk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. Our Board of Directors (\"Board\") oversees management’s approach to risk management, which is designed to support the achievement of our strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value. We regularly review our enterprise level risks, emerging risks and assess our risk tolerance levels and the effectiveness of our risk monitoring and risk management efforts. Our Board has established the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (\"ERMC\") to provide greater focus at the Board level on risk oversight tailored to our business and industries. Our Chief Risk Officer (\"CRO\") is the management lead of the ERMC, and oversees the enterprise risk management process of the Company, including climate-related risks and opportunities and their impacts on our business strategy, operations and investments. Additionally, each of our other Board committees considers risks within its area of responsibility. Bunge also has a Management Risk Committee (\"MRC\") in its enterprise risk management (\"ERM\") framework, responsible for reviewing and monitoring key exposures, emerging risks, and drivers of risk. The MRC serves as the most senior management-level risk governance body and reviews on an ongoing basis key enterprise risks, providing oversight for all risk management activities, including our risk framework. The risks covered by the MRC include but are not limited to commodity price risk; market risk; liquidity, interest rate, and financing risk; credit and counterparty risk; country risk; cybersecurity risk; and risks related to climate change. When considering these risks, three criteria are evaluated: the possibility of occurrence, magnitude of risk, and power to mitigate. These risks are directly linked to the substantive impact understood by Bunge, which include but are not limited to the impact related to the potential loss of customer demand for our products or the ability to supply products in sufficient volumes to meet demand. \nThe primary risks that our company is subject to are discussed under the heading \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and we also describe our efforts to hedge and actively manage our market risks, including those associated with our positions in physical and derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, inland and ocean freight, foreign currency, and interest rates under the heading \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nInsurance\nIn each country in which we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We financially insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that we deem appropriate for a company of our size and activities, including against certain risks associated with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, based on an analysis of the relative risks, costs, and market availability of insurance. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate the risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility. However, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not insured in full or in part, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperating Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in Note 26- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development, Innovation, Patents, and Licenses\nOur research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations and create value for our customers. In our refined and specialty oils and milling businesses, we have several research and development centers globally to support product development and enhancement, working alongside our key customers. We monitor the latest advancements in our core areas via an external technology scouting program. Additionally, Bunge Ventures, our corporate venture capital and private capital markets principal investing arm, invests in start-ups and other early-stage companies that are developing new technologies relevant to our industries. Additionally, we invest capital and human resources in digital innovations, aimed at using technology, data and analytics to improve how we perform our most important functions across our value chains, including origination, production, \nlogistics, and customer experience. \nWe own trademarks, patents, and licenses covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. However, neither our business as a whole nor any segment is dependent on any specific trademark, patent, or license. \nSeasonality\nIn our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year, since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres, and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, and the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. Our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are, therefore, generally at lower levels during the first quarter.\nIn our Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events.\nGovernment Regulation\nIn each of the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business, including general business regulations as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing, and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food, and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, limitations on water use, as well as other environmental regulations. Additionally, from time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions, and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food, and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to ensure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.\nMany countries use and produce biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed, canola, and other oilseeds, into ethanol, renewable diesel, or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives to produce biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and several South-East Asian and European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuel use in transport fuels at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation.\nWe are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and we incur costs to comply with these requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental matters has not had a material financial or competitive effect on our business. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under these laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, and other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.\nOur business could also be affected by the regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, policies related to national emission reduction plans, and regulations related to conservation and eliminating deforestation. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions or deforestation, including, but not limited to, the Unites States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. In addition, the European Union Deforestation Regulation (\"EUDR\") will require companies trading in certain commodities, including palm oil and soy, as well as products derived from these commodities, to ensure these commodities and related products do not result from deforestation, forest degradation, or breaches of local laws after December 31, 2020 in order to sell such products in the European Union. The EUDR was scheduled to become effective in December 2024, but the European Union reached a deal in December 2024 to postpone its implementation by one year to December 2025. We have begun evaluating implementation efforts necessary to fully comply with the EUDR. Also, failure to comply with the EUDR could result in fines, exclusion from public procurement processes and public funding and prohibition from dealing in the EU in these items. Our operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet related existing obligations with no significant impact on our results of \noperations and competitive position. We regularly assess the potential impacts to our business resulting from regulation or policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions and deforestation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. \nAs regulators increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability issues, we expect to become subject to new environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") disclosure frameworks. Additionally, as a Swiss company, we are also subject to more scrutiny by investors and other stakeholders in Europe related to our ESG disclosures, the actions we are taking and the goals we set. \nWe closely monitor the rules and regulations related to ESG disclosure and their impact on us. For example, in 2022, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\"CSRD\"), which expands the number of companies required to publicly report ESG-related information and defines the ESG-related information that companies are required to report in accordance with European Sustainability Reporting Standards (\"ESRS\"). The CSRD rules may impose increased costs on us related to complying with our reporting obligations and increase risks of non-compliance with ESRS and the CSRD. The CSRD will apply to us for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2025, with our first report to be published in 2026. We have begun evaluating CSRD disclosures in accordance with ESRS and aim to comply with all applicable in-scope CSRD reporting requirements. \nAs a publicly traded company incorporated in Switzerland, Bunge is also required under Swiss law to prepare a report covering five non-financial matters, namely environmental matters (in particular climate issues), social issues, employee-related issues (including diversity aspects), respect for human rights, and combating corruption. The report must include (i) a description of our business model, (ii) a description of the policies adopted in relation to these matters, including the due diligence applied, (iii) a presentation of the measures taken to implement these policies and an assessment of the effectiveness of these measures, (iv) a description of the main risks related to these matters and how we are dealing with these risks, and (v) the main performance indicators for the Company’s activities in relation to these matters. We are required to submit a report with respect to the previous fiscal year to our shareholders for approval each year at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, under the Swiss Code of Obligations, certain Bunge subsidiaries in Switzerland must adhere to due diligence and transparency requirements concerning child labor in the supply chain if these subsidiaries offer products or services in relation to which there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they have been manufactured or provided using child labor. We comply with these requirements by adhering to internationally recognized regulations deemed equivalent under Swiss law. \nFurther, on October 7, 2023, California enacted the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act and the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (together, the \"Climate Accountability Package\"). The Climate Accountability Package requires, among other things, all private and public companies with an annual revenue of more than $1 billion and doing business in California to publicly disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions beginning in 2026 and Scope 3 GHG emissions in 2027. We are assessing the applicability of the Climate Accountability Package to us. \nAlthough, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The scope of physical effects of climate change, including shifts in agricultural production areas and climatic volatility, is uncertain, but could in the long-term result in increased adverse incidents of weather-related events that cause disruptions to our operations and may ultimately result in stranded physical assets. We currently believe the breadth and diversification of our global asset network, as well as our participation in the global trade of agricultural commodities, will help to mitigate these risks. \nSustainability\nBunge believes sustainability is critical to our business. While we have consistently incorporated ESG factors into Bunge’s strategy, investments and operations, we have intensified our efforts in light of new consumer trends, risks arising from factors such as climate change, and new growth opportunities defined by low-carbon attributes. We integrate ESG factors into nearly every area of our business, from how we evaluate new growth markets, plan and develop our strategic goals, compensate our employees and operate our facilities, to how we engage with our customers, suppliers, employees, communities, shareholders and other stakeholders. We encourage Bunge leadership around the globe to embrace sustainable decision-making across our value chains built on a foundation of ethical leadership, accountability and environmental stewardship. Our key areas of growth, comprising expansion of our oilseed processing and origination capabilities, production of renewable feedstocks, increasing our plant lipids portfolio and development of new plant-based protein ingredients, are not only central to our business strategy but also a testament to the alignment of sustainability with our corporate vision.\nA key feature of our sustainability strategy is to leverage Bunge’s position in the value chain and its experience delivering sustainable solutions to stakeholders in order to collaboratively promote industry-wide transformation. Bunge has been a \nfounder and active member of leading industry associations and platforms to find practical solutions to certain sustainability challenges, such as climate change, land use change, human rights and biodiversity. We have implemented programs and strategies to mitigate against native vegetation conversion and deforestation in our supply chains associated with agricultural commodity production and trade, a commitment that was established in 2015. As of December 31, 2024, we achieved 100% traceability and monitoring of our direct and indirect soy supply chains in the priority regions of Brazil. We intend to build on our shared efforts, working with governments, farmers, and other key stakeholders in our supply chains, to identify opportunities for public-private collaboration focused on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation. \nBunge’s public reporting on ESG conforms with internationally recognized frameworks and standards, the details of which are captured in the annual global sustainability report published in the first half of each year. The 2025 global sustainability report will contain further information on Bunge’s ESG strategy, performance, and other disclosures. This report is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. In addition, as described above, as a Swiss corporation, Bunge is also required under Swiss law to establish an annual non-financial matter report covering, among other things, certain ESG matters (which will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2025 Annual Meeting), and to publish an annual report on compliance with our child labor diligence obligations. Such reports are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. \nGovernance\nBunge’s five Board committees each share responsibility to oversee ESG and sustainability considerations, including among other things, climate change, deforestation and native vegetation conversion, water, biodiversity, human rights, social development and stakeholder engagement related to these matters.\nThe Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee (\"SCRC\") of the Board oversees and provides input on the development of corporate social responsibility governance, policies, strategies, and programs, including, but not limited to: human rights; food safety; environmental matters related to climate change and emissions, water conservation and management, energy consumption and efficiency, product stewardship, and waste disposal; the Company’s public commitments regarding non-deforestation and emissions reduction; corporate sustainability reporting; ESG external trends and public affairs; relationships with stakeholders; assisting the ERMC in fulfilling their risk management oversight responsibility relating to ESG; and philanthropy and community relations. Additionally, the ERMC of the Board evaluates climate related risks and exposures in connection with its periodic review of other enterprise risks and management’s risk mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee evaluates trends, risks, and developments in non-financial reporting practices and requirements that may impact the Company’s regulatory filings, including ESG-related disclosures. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee oversees the Company’s compensation framework, governance guidelines and performance criteria, workforce trends, talent management and succession planning. The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee oversees the Company’s corporate governance frameworks and board practices, as well as the identification of qualified board candidates with the appropriate skills, diversity and experience to oversee the Company’s business. \nThe Company’s sustainability function is led by the Chief Sustainability Officer and Government Affairs (\"CSO\"), who reports to our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CSO oversees a global team operating across multiple geographies and functions, which regularly engages business leadership to ensure company-wide alignment with sustainability objectives and opportunities.\nStrategy\nWe leverage our leadership, extensive knowledge of the industry, and our deeply rooted relationships with customers at both ends of the value chain to address the sustainability challenges facing the food, feed, and fuel supply chains in which we operate. We intend to address those challenges by, among other things, connecting farmers and our end customers as they seek to establish common approaches to overcome shared sustainability challenges. This means that the decisions we make — from strategy to investments to operations — look at the associated GHG impact and how it will shape our long-term climate ambitions. With a sustainability mindset, we can enhance our focus on decarbonization in both our operations and in our supply chains, continue providing low carbon solutions to our food, feed, and fuel customers, and ensuring climate-related risks are deeply embedded into our governance framework. We have a proud history of accomplishment that we are building on to realize our approach. For example, Bunge is actively engaged in supplying low carbon feedstock for renewable fuels, sourcing and supplying grains planted under regenerative agricultural practices, and supplying certified and verified deforestation-free grains and by-products, among other initiatives. These business objectives are a natural extension of our sustainability efforts and have been partly developed by applying a \"climate lens\" to our strategic decision-making.\nRisk Management\nBunge's ERM framework incorporates detailed sustainability risks and risk factors into the ERM process. These include risks emanating from changing climate and weather patterns, water scarcity, deforestation, human rights, farmer productivity, and increasing taxation and regulation on GHG emissions. The ERM process provides Bunge with greater oversight and management of climate-related risks and the potential financial implications, and will help ensure continued short-, medium- and long-term resilience. \nClimate risks are overseen at the Board level by the ERMC, which has responsibility for supervising the quality and integrity of our risk management practices. Enterprise risk management is overseen at the executive level by the CRO, who reports to our CEO, with input from relevant teams and functions. Further, as noted above the MRC reviews climate-related risks, such as adverse weather patterns, current or emerging regulations, reputational hazards, and other sources which are included in this process. The results of these assessments are distributed throughout the executive leadership team and to the Board, and provided to key stakeholders in various internal risk reports. In recent years, new climate risk factors were incorporated into the MRC's assessment process. These data points are in addition to dozens of other sustainability-related factors that are assessed by the MRC and communicated to the ERMC. \nMetrics and Targets\nWhen setting public commitments, particularly quantifiable targets on GHG emissions and related measures, Bunge’s leadership and employees regularly engage with stakeholders, review market and consumer trends, and consider business risks and opportunities. Where feasible, Bunge also engages in sector-wide discussions to align with value chain partners so that metrics and targets are aligned for maximum impact and transformation. \nBunge established Science Based Targets (\"SBTs\") in 2021, which were verified by the SBTi and cover absolute reductions in GHG emissions across all three Scopes. From a 2020 baseline to a 2030 deadline, the targets call for:\n•Scopes 1 & 2 - Absolute reduction of 25%\n•Scope 3 - Absolute reduction of 12.3%\nDue to the nature of Bunge’s business and operations, the vast majority of GHG emissions are found within the value chain (Scope 3), particularly upstream sources. Therefore, a substantial portion of Bunge’s emissions reduction will be achieved by meeting the Company’s 2025 non-deforestation commitment. Additional emissions reduction activities to meet the SBTs include enhancements to the Company’s plants, procurement of zero- or low-carbon electricity sources, and the uptake of certified products and regenerative farming practices. \nAdditional metrics and targets include intensity reductions (per ton of product) by 2026 from a 2016 baseline for water (10% overall and 25% for facilities located in areas of high water stress), waste disposal to landfill (10%), and energy (10%).\nWe track the progress towards these targets and disclose the performance publicly in our annual global sustainability report.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 23,000 people. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions and their employment is governed by collective bargaining agreements. In general, we consider our employee relations to be positive.\nOur People\nWe care about our people. We listen, empower, develop and reward them with the goal of driving high levels of engagement and commitment to Bunge. From hiring the best talent to creating a culture of belonging, through career development, and total rewards, Bunge strives to create programs and resources that enhance our workplace environment.\n\n                                              % of Total Headcount\nRegion                                                            \nSouth America                                          37        %\nEMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa)                     28        %\nNorth America                                          19        %\nAsia                                                   16        %\nTalent Acquisition\nAt Bunge, we aim to attract the best talent for today and in the future. \nInclusion & Belonging\nWe value inclusion and respect the unique viewpoints our employees bring to make Bunge a dynamic and innovative company.

We are committed to supporting our communities and strengthening our efforts to ensure our workforce, programs, and practices enhance our culture of belonging.\nLearning & Development \nWe focus on learning and development that helps employees develop the skills they need both today and in the future. One of the greatest drivers of growth for our people is their own initiative and sense of career ownership. We encourage employees and their leaders to co-create Individual Development Plans and provide employees access to apply for internal career opportunities that match their interests, skills, and business needs.\nSafety\nOur care and concern for people and their families is rooted in always Doing What's Right when it comes to safety. We believe everyone has the right to a safe work environment. Our approach focuses on incident prevention and mitigation, and we are committed to learning and improving through demonstrated safety leadership at all levels. \nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.bunge.com.

NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business—On November 1, 2023, Bunge Global SA completed the change of jurisdiction of incorporation of its group holding company from Bermuda to Switzerland (the \"Redomestication\"). The Redomestication, as approved by our shareholders, was effected pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law. Each common share of Bunge Limited, par value $0.01 per share, was cancelled in exchange for an equal number of registered shares of Bunge Global SA, par value $0.01 per share (the \"registered shares\"). The registered shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the symbol \"BG\" on November 1, 2023, which is the same symbol under which the Bunge Limited shares were previously traded. References to the term \"shares\" refer to Bunge Limited common shares prior to the Redomestication and to Bunge Global SA registered shares after the Redomestication, unless otherwise specified. See Note 22- Equity for further information.  \nBunge Global SA, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively \"Bunge\" or \"the Company\"), is a leading global agribusiness and food company. Bunge operates in four reportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy. \nCorporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment, includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.\nAgribusiness—Bunge's Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing, and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.\nBunge's Agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments.\nRefined and Specialty Oils —Bunge's Refined and Specialty Oils segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils and fats, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process, including renewable diesel feedstocks, and refines and fractionates palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. Bunge's refined and specialty oils operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa.\nMilling —Bunge's Milling segment primarily comprises wheat and corn milling businesses that purchase wheat and corn directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers, and other customers. Due to the completion of the sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling business during the third quarter of 2022, Bunge's wheat milling activities are now primarily located in Brazil. Corn milling activities are primarily located in the United States and Mexico. See Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information on the completed sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling activities.\nSugar and Bioenergy—Bunge's Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily consists of results from the Company's previously owned 50% ownership interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. (\"BP\"). On October 1, 2024, Bunge completed the sale of our 50% ownership share in BP Bunge Bioenergia to BP. Prior to the sale, the joint venture operated in the ethanol, biopower, and sugar markets in Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia operated on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. Bunge accounted for its interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. See Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions for further details regarding the Company's disposition of BP Bunge Bioenergia.\nArgentina\nBunge has significant operating subsidiaries in Argentina. Argentina has experienced hyperinflation, high fiscal deficit and negative Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") growth in recent years. Throughout 2023 and 2022, Argentina’s government has \nF-11\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\npublished multiple Emergency Decrees, certain of which have introduced preferential U.S. dollar to Argentine peso foreign exchange rates (collectively referred to as the \"Export Programs\"). Preferential exchange rates under the Export Programs were available exclusively during specific periods of time to be used on qualifying Argentine peso denominated purchases of certain commodities and payment of export duties. The Export Programs were aimed at boosting farmer selling and in turn commodity exports generating an influx of foreign currency. During the periods covered by the Export Programs, qualifying commodity prices in Argentine pesos were directly impacted by the preferential rates. Transactions related to these Export Programs were accounted for at the preferential rate. There were no transactions accounted for utilizing a preferential rate for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nUkraine-Russia War\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military invasion of Ukraine (the \"war\"). Bunge’s Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates both a corn milling facility and an oilseed processor in Ukraine via joint ventures. As of December 31, 2024, total assets and total liabilities associated with Bunge’s Ukrainian subsidiaries each comprise less than 3% of Bunge’s consolidated Total assets and Total liabilities, respectively. \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized insurance recoveries related to the war of $58 million which were recorded in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income. The recoveries included $52 million attributable to business interruption and $6 million attributable to property damage. No impairments or charges related to the war were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. However, the scope, intensity, duration, and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and any continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge, including its Ukrainian operations.\nBasis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years, except as described in these notes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary and, as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, or fair value if readily determinable. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economics of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. The primary beneficiary analysis must be continually reassessed and requires the exercise of judgement. VIE assessments are revisited upon the occurrence of relevant reconsideration events. \nNoncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as Noncontrolling interests or Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as Net (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.\nReclassifications—Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed its reporting of purchases and sales activity within the readily marketable inventories Level 3 reconciliation to align with the Company's value chain trade flows and intended use, which had no net impact on Level 3 readily marketable inventories period end balances. Prior period activity has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. See Note 15- Fair Value Measurements for further details regarding the reclassification.\nFurther, effective January 1, 2023, the Company changed its reporting of cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of three months or less to be presented on a net basis in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Company presented cash proceeds from and repayments of short-term debt with maturities of three months or less separately in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.\nF-12\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nUse of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Bunge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOffsetting—In the normal course of its operations the Company routinely enters into transactions resulting in the recognition of assets and liabilities stemming from unconditional obligations, for example trade receivables and trade payables, or conditional obligations, for example unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts at fair value, with the same counterparty. The Company generally records all such assets and liabilities on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting agreements.\nHowever, the Company also engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar and foreign currency denominated letters of credit (\"LCs\") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts and other programs in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, when all related assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements and the criteria of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 210-20, Offsetting, has been met. Cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements—Bunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. As such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then the foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.\nForeign Currency Transactions—Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Cash held for sale—Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash and cash equivalents in Assets held for sale reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n                                                                                          December 31,\n(US$ in millions)                                                 2024            2023            2022\nCash and cash equivalents                                   $3,311          $2,602          $1,104    \nRestricted cash included in Other current assets                17              21              26    \nCash and cash equivalents in Assets held for sale                —               —              22    \nTotal                                                       $3,328          $2,623          $1,152    \nTrade Accounts Receivable—Trade accounts receivable is stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based on lifetime expected credit losses using an aging schedule for each pool of trade accounts receivable. Pools are determined based on risk characteristics such as the type of customer and geography. A default rate is derived using a provision matrix with data based on Bunge's historical receivables information. The default rate is then applied to the pool to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. Given the short-term nature of the Company's trade accounts receivable, the default rate is only adjusted if significant changes in the credit profile of the portfolio are identified (e.g., poor crop years, credit issues at the country level, systematic risk), resulting in historic loss rates that are not representative of forecasted losses. Uncollectible accounts are \nF-13\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nwritten off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when the Company has determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.\nBunge records and reports accrued interest receivable within the same line item as the related trade accounts receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated on the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable, including accrued interest receivable. Bunge recognizes credit loss expense when establishing an allowance for accrued interest receivable.\nSecured Advances to Suppliers—Secured advances to suppliers are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Secured advances to suppliers are expected to be settled through delivery of non-cash assets and as such, allowances are established when collection is not probable. Bunge establishes an allowance for secured advances to suppliers, generally farmers and resellers of grain, based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions, as well as specific supplier collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.\nSecured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates that reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.\nBunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.\nInventories—Readily marketable inventories (\"RMI\") are agricultural commodity inventories, primarily including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, softseeds and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are recorded at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing, and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of RMI are recognized in earnings as a component of Cost of goods sold.\nInventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value by inventory product class. Cost is determined primarily using the weighted-average cost method.\nFair Value Measurements—Bunge determines fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its RMI, derivatives, and certain other assets and liabilities based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel          Description                                                                               Financial Instrument (Assets / Liabilities)     \nLevel 1        Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Bunge’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nBunge’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.\nThe majority of Bunge's exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily, generally through its clearing subsidiary, and therefore such futures are not included in the assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Bunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate exposure to market variables (see Note 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). Additionally, commodity contracts relating to forward sales of commodities primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment, including but not limited to soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, softseeds and wheat, are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815 (see Revenue Recognition below).\nGenerally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in Other current assets or Other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. For derivatives designated as hedges, Bunge assesses at the inception of the hedge whether any such derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items and, on an ongoing basis, qualitatively or quantitatively tests whether that assertion is still met. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. When using forward derivative contracts as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.\nMarketable Securities and Other Short-Term Investments—Bunge classifies its marketable debt securities and short-term investments as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or held-for-trading. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Held-to-maturity debt investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Debt \nF-15\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ntrading securities and all equity securities are recorded at fair value and are bought and held principally for selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time, with all gains (losses) included in Net income. Bunge monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary.\nRecoverable Taxes—Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in Other current assets or Other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net—Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements that extend either the life, capacity, efficiency, or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.\nDepreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n                                           Years\nBuildings                                10 - 50\nMachinery and equipment                   3 - 25\nFurniture, fixtures and other             3 - 20\nGoodwill—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment, or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see Note 8- Goodwill).\nOther Intangible Assets—Finite-lived intangible assets primarily include trademarks, customer relationships and lists, port facility usage rights, licenses and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives, or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract (see Note 9- Other Intangible Assets).\nImpairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets—Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits, and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures, and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below the asset's carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in Cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 10- Impairments).\nProperty, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nInvestments in Affiliates—Bunge has investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. Bunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the \nF-16\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ninvestment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value (see Note 10- Impairments and Note 11- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities).\nRevenue Recognition—The Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"), and sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"). Additional information about the Company’s revenues can be found in Note 26- Segment Information.\nRevenue from commodity contracts (ASC 815)—Revenue from commodity contracts primarily relates to forward sales of commodities including, but not limited to soybeans, soybean meal and oil, softseeds, corn, and wheat accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815, primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment. These forward sales meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 as they have an underlying (e.g., the price of soybeans), a notional amount (e.g., metric tons), no initial net investment, and can be net settled since the commodity is readily convertible to cash. Bunge generally does not apply the normal purchase and normal sale exception available under ASC 815 to these contracts. Certain of the Company’s sales in its Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments also qualify as derivatives, primarily sales of commodities like bulk soybean and canola oil.\nRevenue from commodity contracts is recognized in Net sales for the contracted amount when the contracts are settled at a point in time by transferring control of the commodity to the customer, similarly to revenue recognized from contracts with customers under ASC 606. From inception through settlement, these forward sales arrangements are recorded at fair value under ASC 815 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Cost of goods sold and carried on the consolidated balance sheets as current assets (see Note 6- Other Current Assets) or current liabilities (see Note 13- Other Current Liabilities), respectively. Further information about the fair value of these contracts is presented in Note 15- Fair Value Measurements.   \nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)—Revenue from contracts with customers accounted for under ASC 606 is primarily generated in the Company's Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments through the sale of refined edible oil-based products such as packaged vegetable oils, shortenings, margarines, and mayonnaise; milled grain products such as wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products; and fertilizer products. These sales are accounted for under ASC 606 as these sales arrangements do not meet the criteria to be considered derivatives under ASC 815. These revenues are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and exclude sales taxes, discounts related to promotional programs, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when significant risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms provide for transfer of control of a product either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold. In contracts that do not specify the timing of transfer of legal title or transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, judgment is required in determining the timing of transfer of control. In such cases, the Company considers standard business practices and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to the transaction to determine when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. \nThe transaction price is generally allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company’s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Variable consideration is generally known upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction, which are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. \nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.\nWarranties provided to customers are primarily assurance-type warranties on the fitness of purpose and merchantability of the Company’s goods and services. The Company does not provide service-type warranties to customers.\nPayment is generally due at the time of shipment or delivery, or within a specified time frame after shipment or delivery, which is generally 30-60 days. The Company’s contracts generally provide customers the right to reject any products that do not meet agreed quality specifications. Product returns and refunds are not material.\nF-17\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nAdditionally, the Company recognizes revenue in the Agribusiness segment from ocean freight and port services over time, as the related services are performed. Performance obligations are typically completed within a fiscal quarter and any unearned revenue or accrued revenues are not material.\nShare-Based Compensation—Bunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see Note 24- Share-based Compensation). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nIncome Taxes—Income tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence indicates that it is not \"more likely than not\" that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 14- Income Taxes).\nResearch and Development—Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $30 million, $35 million, and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nGovernmental Assistance—Government grants are accounted for by analogy to International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, and are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the established conditions will be met and the benefit will be received. Benefits are recognized either as a reduction of taxes payable or a credit in earnings.\nBunge qualifies for business incentives from governmental entities at various localities in which the Company operates. These programs primarily consist of tax incentives and cash grants designed to promote regional social and economic development or to incentivize production of clean energy.\nRegional social and economic development—Bunge receives tax credits from foreign state governments on the sale of eligible products. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if Bunge fails to meet program requirements, including job creation and production levels. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Bunge recorded program tax credits of $129 million, $176 million and $205 million in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income, respectively. At December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Bunge recognized a $12 million and $13 million reduction to Other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets related to benefits not yet realized.\nClean energy—Bunge receives cash grants from a governmental agency from the sale of clean energy. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if the Company does not follow program production efficiency requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Bunge recorded program related cash grants of $23 million, $24 million and $19 million in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income, respectively. At December 31, 2024, and 2023, Bunge recognized a $4 million and $1 million increase to Trade accounts receivable, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets related to benefits not yet realized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280) (\"ASU 2023-07\"), which requires incremental disclosures related to reportable segments, including disaggregated expense information and the title and position of the company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), as identified for purposes of segment determination. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Entities must adopt the changes to the segment reporting guidance on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance resulted in expanded disclosures in Note 26- Segment Information. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The standard is intended to enhance transparency of income statement disclosures, primarily through additional disaggregation of relevant expense captions. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Entities can \nF-18\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nadopt the change prospectively or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted final climate-related disclosure rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The rules require disclosure of governance, risk management, and strategy related to material climate-related risks as well as disclosure of material greenhouse gas emissions in registration statements and annual reports. In addition, the rules require presentation of certain climate-related disclosures in the annual consolidated financial statements. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the effective date of the final rules pending completion of judicial review following certain legal challenges. The rules are effective beginning with annual periods ending December 31, 2025, pending resolution of the stay. Bunge is currently evaluating the impact of the rules on the Company’s disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) (\"ASU 2023-09\"). ASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The new requirements apply to all entities subject to income taxes and will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nAcquisitions\nViterra Limited Business Combination Agreement\nOn June 13, 2023, Bunge entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement\") with Viterra Limited (\"Viterra\") and its shareholders including certain affiliates of Glencore PLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (collectively, the \"Sellers\"), to acquire Viterra in a stock and cash transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). Bunge shareholders approved the Acquisition at the Extraordinary General Meeting held October 5, 2023. The Acquisition of Viterra by Bunge will create an innovative global agribusiness company well positioned to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets and better serve farmers and end-customers. \nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Viterra shareholders are anticipated to receive approximately 65.6 million registered shares of Bunge, with an aggregate value of approximately $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 and receive approximately $2.0 billion in cash (collectively the \"Transaction Consideration\"), in return for 100% of the outstanding equity of Viterra. The determination of the final value of the Transaction Consideration will depend on the Company's share price at the time of closing. Upon completion of the transaction, the Sellers are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023. \nIn connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Bunge secured a total of $8.0 billion in acquisition debt financing (\"Acquisition Financing\"). On September 17, 2024, Bunge completed the sale and issuance of three tranches of unsecured senior notes (\"Senior Notes\") for an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. See Note 17- Debt for further information. As a result of the Senior Notes issuance, and in accordance with its terms, the Acquisition Financing commitment was reduced by $2.0 billion with $6.0 billion available as of December 31, 2024. Bunge intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the Acquisition Financing and Senior Notes issuance to fund a portion of the cash consideration for Bunge's Acquisition of Viterra and to repay a portion of certain Viterra debt to be assumed in connection with the Acquisition, including, in each case, related fees and expenses, and, with any remaining amounts, for general corporate purposes. \nAlso, in the third quarter of 2024, Bunge's wholly-owned subsidiary, Bunge Limited Finance Corp. (\"BLFC\"), commenced offers (the \"US Exchange Offers\") to exchange all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Viterra Finance B.V. (\"VFBV\") and guaranteed by Viterra and Viterra B.V., for up to $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by BLFC and guaranteed by Bunge. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, Viterra commenced a consent solicitation (the \"European Consent Solicitation\") to amend the indenture governing VFBV's outstanding 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 0.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and outstanding 700 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 1.000% senior unsecured notes due 2028 to, among other things, substitute the issuer and guarantors of such notes with Bunge Finance Europe B.V. (\"BFE\"), a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Bunge, as issuer, and Bunge as guarantor. The US \nF-19\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nExchange Offers and European Consent Solicitation are conditioned, among other things, upon the consummation of the Acquisition. See Note 17- Debt for further information. \nThe Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Acquisition is expected to receive the remaining regulatory approvals and close in the next few months. The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties and includes certain customary termination rights. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, Bunge would be obligated to pay the Sellers a fee of $400 million in the aggregate. \nAdditionally, on June 12, 2023, in contemplation of the Business Combination Agreement, Bunge Limited's Board of Directors approved the expansion of an existing share repurchase program resulting in an aggregate purchase authorization of $2.0 billion for the repurchase of Bunge's issued and outstanding shares. On November 13, 2024, Bunge Global SA's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of its issued and outstanding registered shares. During the period June 13, 2023 through December 31, 2024, Bunge repurchased 17,558,624 shares for $1.7 billion. Therefore, as of December 31, 2024, an aggregate purchase authorization of $800 million remains outstanding for repurchases under the program. See Note 22- Equity for further details on share repurchases.\nEspaçogrãos Grain Elevators\nOn November 30, 2023, Bunge entered into purchase and sale agreements with Espaçogrãos to acquire three grain elevators and related assets (\"Silos\") for total cash consideration of approximately $71 million, inclusive of $35 million of advance payments expected prior to the close. Advance payments are refundable under certain conditions, including in the event closing does not occur. The Silos are located in the Brazilian cities of Nova Mutum, Matupa and Alta Floresta. In the second quarter of 2024, Bunge closed on the Nova Mutum Silo and the remaining asset acquisitions are expected to close separately per each agreement in the first half of 2025, subject to certain closing conditions. \nCJ Latam and Selecta Share Purchase Agreement\nOn October 10, 2023, Bunge entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with CJ CheilJedang Corporation and STIC CJ Global Investment Corporate Partnership Private Equity Fund to acquire 100% of outstanding equity of CJ Latam Participações Ltda. and CJ Selecta S.A. (collectively, \"CJ\") for a total cash consideration of approximately $510 million to be adjusted for net debt, plus an additional sum in consideration for the value of net working capital. Operations of CJ primarily consist of an oilseed processing facility located in Brazil. Bunge expects to finance the transaction through cash from operations and existing financing facilities. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\nFuji Oils New Orleans, LLC Port Based Refinery\nOn April 14, 2023, Bunge, through its 80% ownership of Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad, completed its purchase of Fuji Oils New Orleans, LLC's port-based refinery. The refinery is located in International-Matex Tank Terminals' Avondale Terminal, in Avondale, Louisiana in the United States. Cash consideration for the asset acquisition of $181 million was allocated to Property, plant and equipment, net ($220 million), inclusive of a finance lease right of use asset ($52 million), long-term finance lease obligations ($41 million) included in Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt, and other net working capital ($2 million).\nF-20\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nDispositions\nBP Bunge Bioenergia\nOn June 19, 2024, Bunge entered into a definitive share purchase agreement with BP Biofuels Brazil Investment Limited (\"BP\") to sell its 50% ownership share in BP Bunge Bioenergia. On October 1, 2024, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the share purchase agreement for a total net amount of $828 million in consideration inclusive of certain closing adjustments for the value of net working capital and net debt, among other items. As of December 31, 2024, $728 million in cash consideration had been received and recorded as a cash inflow within Proceeds from investments in affiliates on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Also, per the terms of the agreement, a $100 million deferred payment, received in early 2025 and applied to the consideration of the transaction, has been recorded within Other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. \n In connection with the transaction, Bunge has agreed to indemnify BP against future losses associated with certain legal claims as defined in the share purchase agreement. As a consequence, Bunge recognized a liability of $95 million in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and ASC 450, Contingencies. See Note 20- Commitments and Contingencies for more information. \nThe disposal group included Investments in affiliates of $385 million and a $142 million release of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, among other items, reported under the Sugar and Bioenergy segment. The transaction close resulted in a pretax gain on sale of $195 million, which was recorded within Other income (expense) - net, in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nPartnership with Repsol - Bunge Iberica SA\n On March 26, 2024, Bunge entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with Repsol Industrial Transformation, SLU, a wholly owned subsidiary of Repsol SA, whereby Bunge will divest 40% of its Spanish operating subsidiary, Bunge Iberica SA (\"BISA\"), in exchange for approximately $300 million plus up to $40 million in contingent payments, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. BISA operates three industrial facilities in the Iberian Peninsula. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. \nRussian Oilseed Processing and Refining Operations Disposition\nOn September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia (referred to as the \"disposal group\"), to Karen Vanetsyan (the \"Buyer\"), in exchange for a cash price approximately equal to the book value of the disposal group's net assets. On January 9, 2023, Bunge and the Buyer agreed to a purchase price adjustment. The purchase price adjustment and cumulative translation adjustment losses, among other items related to the disposal group, resulted in a corresponding impairment loss on sale of $103 million, recognized in Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement with no material impact to the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the transaction, Bunge agreed to indemnify the Buyer against certain legal claims involving Bunge's Russian subsidiary. Management has assessed the likelihood of any loss related to claims covered by the indemnity as remote, and recognized a liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees.

TRADE STRUCTURED FINANCE PROGRAM\nThe Company engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar and foreign currency denominated letters of credit (\"LCs\") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements.\n For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, net returns from these activities were $58 million, $36 million, and $32 million, respectively, and were included as a reduction of Cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, time deposits and LCs of $6,914 million and $6,880 million, respectively, were presented net on the consolidated balance sheets as the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, had been met. At December 31, 2024, and 2023, time deposits, including those presented on a net basis, carried weighted-average interest rates of 5.22% and 5.77%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, total net proceeds from discounting of LCs were $6,799 million, $6,730 million, and $5,826 million, respectively. These cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs part of the trade structured finance activities, LCs may be sold to financial institutions on a discounted basis. Bunge does not service derecognized LCs. The terms of the sale may require the Company to continue to make periodic interest payments to financial institutions based on changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for a period of up to one year. Bunge’s payment obligation to financial institutions as part of the trade structured finance activities, reported in Other current liabilities, including any unrealized gain or loss on changes in SOFR is not significant as of December 31, 2024, and 2023. The notional amounts of LCs subject to continuing variable interest payments that have been derecognized from the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 are included in Note 16- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The net gain or loss included in Cost of goods sold resulting from the fair valuation of such variable interest rate obligations is not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n4.

Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. The Program is designed to enhance Bunge’s financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations.\nThe Program provides for funding of up to $1.5 billion and from time to time with the consent of the administrative agent, Bunge may request one or more of the existing committed purchasers or new committed purchasers to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $1 billion pursuant to an accordion provision. The Program will terminate on May 17, 2031; however, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the Program will terminate earlier on December 16, 2025, with a feature that permits Bunge to request 364-day extensions. The Program includes sustainability provisions, pursuant to which the applicable margin will be increased or decreased based on Bunge's performance relative to certain sustainability targets, including, but not limited to, science-based targets (\"SBTs\") that define Bunge's climate goals within its operations and a commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in 2025.\nThe Program’s current pledge structure results from a November 16, 2022 amendment which replaced the existing deferred purchase price (\"DPP\") structure. Under the Program's pledge structure, Bunge Securitization B.V. (\"BSBV\"), a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, transfers certain trade receivables to the Purchasers in exchange for a cash payment up to the aggregate size of the Program. Bunge also retains ownership of a population of unsold receivables. BSBV agrees to guaranty the collection of sold receivables and grants a lien to the administrative agent on all unsold receivables.

Bunge does not bear any of the costs or operational risks associated with growing the related crops. The ability of Bunge's counterparties to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are in turn affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs, and crop quality and yields. As a result, the advances are largely collateralized by future crops and physical assets of the suppliers, carry a local market interest rate, and settle when the farmers' crops are harvested and sold. \nThe secured advances to suppliers are reported net of allowances of $5 million and $8 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Bunge periodically evaluates the collectability of its secured advances to suppliers and records allowances if it determines that collection is doubtful. Bunge bases the Company’s determination of the allowance on analyses of the credit quality of individual accounts, also considering the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions, as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. Bunge continuously reviews defaulted supplier receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. Bunge considers all accounts in legal collection processes to be defaulted and past due. For such accounts, Bunge determines the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. For all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), Bunge considers changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, Bunge’s historical experience related to renegotiated accounts, and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. \nInterest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $25 million, $25 million, and $22 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, is included in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income.\n(3) Marketable securities and other short-term investments—Bunge invests in foreign government securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other securities.

GOODWILL\nBunge generally performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, the Company performs an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or the sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) validates changes, if any, to its reporting units with goodwill balances; (2) allocates goodwill to its reporting units to which acquired goodwill relates; (3) determines the carrying value, or book value, of its reporting units; (4) estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for such amount, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \n Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures, other expenses, and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment. Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the market approach include, but are not limited to, determination of the guideline public companies and selection of the market multiples.\nF-27\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the years

The discontinuation triggered a reassessment of the trademarks' estimated useful lives resulting in accelerated amortization through December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, accelerated amortization expense of $21 million was recorded to SG&A expenses within the Refined and Specialty Oils segment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Net income attributable to Bunge included $12 million of expense (net of $5 million in tax benefit) and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests included $3 million of expense (net of $1 million in tax benefit) related to accelerated amortization.\n10.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nBunge participates in various unconsolidated joint ventures and other investments accounted for using the equity method. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with the amortization of basis differences, within (Loss) income from affiliates, in the consolidated statements of income. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate of all basis differences was a debit of $134 million, including $46 million of amortizable basis difference. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate of all basis differences was a credit of $56 million, including $95 million of amortizable basis difference. The change from the prior year is primarily attributable to the sale of BP Bunge Bioenergia. At December 31, 2024, the remaining aggregate basis differences are primarily associated with equity method investments in South America. Certain significant equity method investments at December 31, 2024 are described below.

(“T-39”) - On May 29, 2024, Bunge entered into a share purchase agreement to indirectly acquire a 25% interest of T-39. The acquisition price for Bunge's 25% interest is Brazilian reais (\"R$\") 300 million (approximately $48 million). T-39 operations primarily consist of a port facility located in the Port of Santos, Brazil. The transaction is expected to close in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. \nImpairments of Equity Method Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded total impairments of $53 million associated with its equity method and other equity investments in two start-up manufacturers of novel protein ingredients, Merit Functional Foods Corp. (\"Merit\") and Australian Plant Proteins (\"APP\"). These impairments were determined through management's review of impairment indicators and consideration of the other-than temporary nature of such items. Impairment charges on both the equity method and other equity investments in Merit and APP were recorded to (Loss) income from affiliates within Corporate and Other. \nFurther, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an additional impairment of $16 million associated with APP to (Loss) income from affiliates within Corporate and Other. This impairment was determined through management's review of impairment indicators and consideration of the other-than temporary nature of such items.

Impairment charges were recorded to (Loss) income from affiliates within the Agribusiness segment. \nF-31\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nOn September 19, 2023, Bunge entered into a fixed-priced call option agreement (\"Option\") to acquire the shares of Terminal de Granéis de Santa Catarina (\"TGSC\") with primary assets consisting of a grain port terminal currently under construction in South America strategically located near an existing Bunge facility. The agreement required Bunge to make future installment payments for the Option which were utilized, in part, to fund terminal construction. In November 2024, Bunge exercised the Option and expects to close on the acquisition in early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\nTGSC is a VIE, as a result of having insufficient equity at risk. Bunge is the primary beneficiary due to a de facto agent relationship with the equity owner of TGSC and has consolidated the entity since the third quarter of 2023. As all of TGSC’s equity is held by a third-party, Bunge reflects all TGSC earnings and equity as attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets, respectively. \nTGSC is not a business as defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the non-cash transaction resulting in initial consolidation of TGSC represented an asset acquisition. Positions recognized in the consolidated balance sheet upon initial consolidation consisted primarily of Other intangible assets, net - license ($87 million); Property, plant and equipment, net - construction-in-process ($36 million); Long-term debt ($35 million); and Noncontrolling interests ($91 million). Bunge did not recognize any gain or loss upon initial consolidation of TGSC and no gain or loss is expected as a result of the Option exercise. Bunge will derecognize Noncontrolling interests with any difference between Noncontrolling interests and the Option exercise price recognized in Additional paid-in capital. TGSC's assets can only be used to settle the entity’s own obligations and TGSC’s creditors have no recourse to Bunge’s assets beyond Bunge’s maximum exposure to loss associated with TGSC at any given time.\nOn May 1, 2022, Bunge completed a transaction with Chevron to create a joint venture, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC (\"BCAR\"), leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships, and Chevron’s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing, to help meet the demand for renewable fuels and to develop lower carbon intensity feedstocks. \nBCAR is a VIE in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary because it is responsible for the day-to-day operating decisions of BCAR as well as the marketing of the principal products, primarily soybean meal and oil produced and sold by BCAR, among other factors. BCAR's assets can only be used to settle BCAR’s own obligations and BCAR's creditors have no recourse to Bunge’s assets beyond Bunge’s maximum exposure to loss associated with BCAR at any given time. \nThe following table presents the values of the assets and liabilities associated with the above listed VIEs in which Bunge is considered the primary beneficiary to the extent included in Bunge’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Accordingly, these investments are not consolidated by Bunge. Bunge's exposure to loss related to these unconsolidated investments is $740 million and $589 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Bunge's exposure to loss primarily comprises Bunge's investments balance, third party guarantees, prepayments, long term loans, and certain future commitments assuming full loss of the investment balance and full payment of the guarantees regardless of the probability of such losses actually being incurred in accordance with US GAAP disclosure rules.

These funds are held in judicial escrow related to certain legal proceedings pending resolution and bear interest at the Selic rate, which is the benchmark rate of the Brazilian central bank.\nIncome taxes receivable—Income taxes receivable include overpayments of current income taxes plus accrued interest. These income tax prepayments are expected to be used for the settlement future income tax obligations. Income taxes receivable in Brazil bear interest at the Selic rate.\nLong-term investments—Long-term investments primarily comprise Bunge's noncontrolling equity investments in growth stage agribusiness and food companies held by Bunge Ventures. \nAffiliate loans receivable—Affiliate loans receivable are primarily interest-bearing receivables from unconsolidated affiliates with remaining maturities of greater than one year.\nLong-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net—Bunge provides financing to farmers in Brazil, primarily through secured advances against farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities (primarily soybeans) upon harvest of the then-current year's crop, and through credit sales of fertilizer to farmers. The balance includes certain advance payments on contracts with various unconsolidated investees see Note 19- Related Party Transactions. Certain such long-term receivables from farmers are originally recorded in Other current assets as prepaid commodity purchase contracts or secured advances to suppliers (see Note 6- Other Current Assets) or Other non-current assets according to their maturity. Advances initially recorded in Other current assets are reclassified to Other non-current assets if collection issues arise and amounts become past due with resolution of such matters expected to take more than one year.\nF-34\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nThe average recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $67 million and $88 million, respectively.

reinvested of approximately $2 billion, and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes in the form of withholding taxes to the recipient for an amount of approximately $100 million.\nAt December 31, 2024, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $1.9 billion, of which $1.7 billion have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1.2 billion in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity-by-entity basis as Brazil tax law does not allow consolidated tax filings. At December 31, 2023, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2.3 billion, of which $2.1 billion have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion in Brazil. The decrease in pre-tax loss carryforwards from 2023 to 2024 is primarily attributable to cumulative translation adjustments in Brazil and certain other jurisdictions. The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various period through the year 2044.\nAt December 31, 2024, Bunge’s tax credit carryforwards totaled $410 million, of which $148 million expire in 2029, $249 million expire in 2032, while the remainder is split between a portion expiring within a ten year period and a portion that has no expiration. At December 31, 2023, Bunge's tax credit carryforwards totaled $454 million.\nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances—Bunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $595 million and $590 million, respectively. The net increase of $5 million is primarily attributable to current year losses and interest limitations, offset by currency movement in certain jurisdictions. \nF-38\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits—ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\") requires applying a \"more likely than not\" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, Bunge had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $75 million and $68 million in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, Bunge recognized $2 million, less than $1 million and $(7) million of interest and penalty charges in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, Bunge had recorded accrued interest and penalties of $11 million and $10 million in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n\n(US$ in millions)                                                           2024                  2023                  2022\nBalance at January 1,                                                   $121                   $298                  $329   \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year                                     13                    20   \nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years                                          12                     2   \nReductions for tax positions of prior years (1)                          (2)                  (206)                  (27)   \nSettlements with tax authorities                                         (2)                      —                   (9)   \nExpiration of statute of limitations                                     (4)                    (5)                   (1)   \nForeign currency translation                                             (5)                      9                  (16)   \nBalance at December 31,                                                 $127                   $121                  $298   \n(1)The year ended December 31, 2023 included a reduction of the tax position in Spain resulting from the conclusion of an appeals process. This decrease had no impact on the consolidated statement of income or the consolidated balance sheet as the position was not previously recognized under ASC 740.\nBunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $20 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2025 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations. \nBunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States regions. The table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in significant tax regions:\n\n                                           Open Tax Years\nNorth America                                 2015 - 2024\nSouth America                                 2017 - 2024\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa               2017 - 2024\nAsia-Pacific                                  2015 - 2024\nAs of December 31, 2024, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2018 of approximately R$5.3 billion (approximately $856 million) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of R$13 million (approximately $2 million) as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with the exception of unrecognized tax benefits discussed above) in Brazil and is vigorously defending its position against these assessments.\nBunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $520 million, $655 million and $570 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIn October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operations and Development (the \"OECD\") released an outline that described the conceptual agreement among 138 countries on fundamental reforms to international tax rules. The outline provides for two primary \"Pillars\", however, based on Bunge's current understanding of the proposals, only Pillar Two, which provides for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, impacts Bunge. The reforms were contingent upon the independent actions of participating countries to enact law changes. As a result of the enactment of the Pillar Two rules by both the Netherlands and Switzerland, Bunge became subject to the global minimum tax effective January 1, 2024. The impact of the global minimum tax rules in 2024 was immaterial and is expected to be immaterial in 2025 as well.\nF-39\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n15.

sales of agricultural commodity products in the normal course of business.\n(2)Unrealized gains on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current assets. There were zero and $1 million included in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n(3)Other includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets and Other non-current assets.\nF-40\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n(4)Unrealized losses on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current liabilities. There were $232 million and $260 million included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash equivalents —Cash equivalents primarily includes money market funds and commercial paper investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Cash equivalents with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as Level 1. Cash equivalents with less liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes or pricing models and classified as Level 2.\nReadily marketable inventories—RMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where the Company's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3.\nIf the Company used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.\nDerivatives—The majority of exchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are cash-settled daily and, therefore, are not included in these tables. The Company's forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3, as described below. The Company estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2.\nOTC derivative contracts include swaps, options, and structured transactions that are generally fair valued using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices, and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market.\n Marketable securities and investments—Bunge invests in foreign government securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other securities. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Marketable securities and investments with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as Level 1. Marketable securities and investments with less-liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes or internally developed models and classified as Level 2 or Level 3 as described below. \n    Level 3 Measurements\nThe following relates to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 measurements. An instrument may transfer into or out of Level 3 due to inputs becoming either observable or unobservable. \nLevel 3 Measurements—Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became observable during the period. Bunge's policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to record the transfers at the end of the reporting period. \nLevel 3 Readily marketable inventories and Trade accounts payable—The significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sales contracts, and Trade accounts payable relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, the Company uses proprietary information such as purchase and sales contracts and contracted prices to value \nF-41\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nfreight, premiums and discounts in its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not be expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.\nLevel 3 Derivatives—Level 3 derivative instrument fair value measurements utilizes both market observable and unobservable inputs. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes, and locations.\nLevel 3 Others—Primarily relates to marketable securities and investments valued using third-party quotes or pricing models with inputs based on similar securities adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of the specific characteristics of the securities held by the Company. Such inputs represent a significant component of the fair value of the securities held by the Company, resulting in the securities being classified as Level 3.\nThe tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. These instruments were valued using pricing models that management believes reflect the assumptions that would be used by a marketplace participant.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                           Year Ended December 31, 2024\n(US$ in millions)                                                                            Readily Marketable Inventories(2)                    Derivatives, Net                        Trade                                            Total\n                                                                                                                                                                                       Accounts                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        Payable                                                 \nBalance, January 1, 2024                                                                                    $662                                       $71                          $(232)                                              $501    \nTotal gains and losses (realized/unrealized) included in Cost of goods sold (1)                              645                                      (59)                              15                                               601    \nPurchases                                                                                                  1,704                                         —                           (444)                                             1,260    \nSales                                                                                                    (2,341)                                         —                               —                                           (2,341)    \nSettlements                                                                                                    —                                         —                             607                                               607    \nTransfers into Level 3                                                                                     1,507                 26                                                  (238)                                             1,295    \nTransfers out of Level 3                                                                                 (1,576)                                       (6)                             156                                           (1,426)    \nTranslation adjustment                                                                                     (182)                                       (2)                              74                                             (110)    \nBalance, December 31, 2024                                                                                  $419                                       $30                           $(62)                                              $387    \n(1)Readily marketable inventories, derivatives, net, and trade accounts payable include gains/(losses) of $591 million, $(42) million, and $11 million, respectively, that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains/(losses) relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at December 31, 2024.\n(2)Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed its reporting of purchases and sales activity within the readily marketable inventories Level 3 reconciliation to align with the Company's value chain trade flows and intended use, which had no net impact on Level 3 readily marketable inventories period end balances.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage several market risks, such as interest rate, foreign currency rate, and commodity risk. Some of the hedges the Company enters into qualify for hedge accounting (\"Hedge Accounting Derivatives\") and some, while intended as economic hedges, do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting (\"Economic Hedge Derivatives\"). As these derivatives impact the financial statements in different ways, they are discussed separately below.\nHedge Accounting Derivatives - The Company uses derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage certain of its interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. In executing these hedge strategies, the Company primarily relies on the shortcut and critical terms match methods in designing its hedge accounting strategy, which results in little to no net earnings impact for these hedge relationships. The Company monitors these relationships on a quarterly basis and performs a quantitative analysis to validate the assertion that the hedges are highly effective if there are changes to the hedged item or hedging derivative.\nFair value hedges - These derivatives are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on certain long-term debt. Under fair value hedge accounting, the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying value of hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged, with both adjustments offset to earnings. In other words, the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be substantially offset by the earnings effect of the increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. The net impact of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps is recognized in Interest expense. For cross currency swaps, the changes in currency risk on the derivative are recognized in Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net, and the changes in interest rate risk are recognized in Interest expense. Changes in basis risk are held in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized through the coupon.\nF-43\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nCash flow hedges of currency risk - The Company manages currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the currency forward is reclassified to Net sales, Cost of goods sold, or Selling, general and administrative expenses. These hedges mature at various times through December 2025. Of the amount currently in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, $8 million of deferred losses is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months.\nNet investment hedges - The Company hedges the currency risk of certain of its foreign subsidiaries with currency forwards for which the currency risk is remeasured through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For currency forwards, the forward method is used. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings by way of either sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign subsidiary.\nThe table below provides information about the balance sheet values of hedged items and the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging strategies. The notional amount of the derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). The notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment streams to be made under the contract and is a measure of the Company’s level of activity. The Company discloses derivative notional amounts on a gross basis.\n(US$ in millions)                                                                                                        December 31, 2024       December 31, 2023           Unit of\n                                                                                                                                                                             Measure\nHedging instrument type:                                                                                                                                                            \nFair value hedges of interest rate risk                                                                                                                                             \n                           Interest rate swap - notional amount                                                             $4,900                  $2,900                $ Notional\n                           Cumulative adjustment to long-term debt from active application of hedge accounting              $(246)                  $(260)                $ Notional\n                           Carrying value of hedged debt                                                                    $4,600                  $2,625                $ Notional\nCash flow hedges of currency risk                                                                                                                                                   \n                           Foreign currency forward - notional amount                                                           $—                     $54                $ Notional\n                           Foreign currency option - notional amount                                                          $120                     $99                $ Notional\nNet investment hedges                                                                                                                                                               \n                           Foreign currency forward - notional amount                                                         $550                  $1,112                $ Notional\nEconomic Hedge Derivatives - In addition to using derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships, the Company enters into derivatives to economically hedge its exposure to a variety of market risks it incurs in the normal course of operations.\nInterest rate derivatives are used to hedge exposures to the Company's financial instrument portfolios and debt issuances. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is primarily presented in Interest expense.\nCurrency derivatives are used to hedge the balance sheet and commercial exposures that arise from the Company's global operations. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold when hedging commercial exposures and Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net when hedging monetary exposures.\nAgricultural commodity derivatives are used primarily to manage exposures related to the Company's inventory and forward purchase and sales contracts. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments referred to as forward freight agreements (\"FFA\") and FFA options to hedge portions of its current and anticipated ocean freight costs. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.\nThe Company uses energy derivative instruments to manage its exposure to volatility in energy costs. Hedges may be entered into for natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil, including bunker fuel.

Bunge also borrows from time to time in local currencies in various foreign jurisdictions. Interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, the impact of designated interest rate hedges, and charges on certain lending transactions. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 6.22% and 8.36%, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nOn March 1, 2024, Bunge entered into an unsecured $3.2 billion 5-year revolving credit agreement (the \"$3.2 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement\") with a group of lenders, maturing on March 1, 2029. Bunge may from time-to-time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations by an aggregate amount up to $1.5 billion, pursuant to an accordion provision. Current commitments in the aggregate amount of $1.95 billion are available to be drawn. Incremental commitments in the aggregate amount of $1.25 billion are available to be drawn on and after the date Bunge completes its acquisition of Viterra, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Therefore, upon completion of the acquisition of Viterra, the total committed capacity will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion. The $3.2 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement replaced an existing $1.95 billion 5-year revolving credit agreement which was terminated on March 1, 2024. Borrowings bear interest at SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment and applicable margin as defined in the $3.2 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024, and 2023, under the $3.2 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively. \nOn March 1, 2024, Bunge exercised the accordion provision set forth in its existing unsecured $1.75 billion 3-year revolving facility agreement (as amended, the \"$3.5 Billion Revolving Facility Agreement\") in an aggregate amount of additional committed capacity of $1.75 billion which is available to be drawn on and after the date Bunge completes its acquisition of Viterra. Upon completion of the acquisition of Viterra, the total committed capacity will be an aggregate of $3.5 billion. The funding cost is also subject to certain premiums or discounts tied to certain sustainability criteria, including, but not limited to, SBTs that define Bunge’s climate goals within its operations and a commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in 2025. The $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement matures on October 6, 2026. Borrowings under the $3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment, which will vary from 0.05% to 0.25% based on the tenor of the interest period selected, plus a margin, which will vary from 0.25% to 0.90%, based on the senior long-term unsecured debt rating provided by Moody’s Investors Services Inc. (\"Moody’s\") and S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\"). Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024, and 2023, under the $3.5 Billion Revolving Facility Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively. \nFurther, on April 12, 2024, Bunge amended and restated its existing $1.1 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement (the \"$1.1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement\") with a group of lenders, to extend the maturity date from June 19, 2024 to April 11, 2025. Bunge may from time-to-time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations under the $1.1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $250 million, pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment and applicable margin as defined in the $1.1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024, and 2023, under the $1.1 Billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement and the predecessor agreement, respectively. \nBunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024, and 2023, under the unsecured $865 million Revolving Credit Facility (the \"$865 Million 2026 Facility\") with a group of lenders, set to mature on October 29, 2026. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $865 Million 2026 Facility.\nBorrowings under the committed revolving credit facilities described above typically have an original maturity of three months or less, resulting in net presentation of proceeds and repayments of short-term debt in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bunge had $5,665 million, unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities with a number of financial institutions.\nF-48\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nCommercial Paper Program\n On April 12, 2024, Bunge increased the aggregate size of its existing commercial paper program by $1 billion to an aggregate of $2 billion (the \"$2 Billion Commercial Paper Program\"). The $2 Billion Commercial Paper Program has no maturity date. Borrowings under the $2 Billion Commercial Paper Program typically have an original maturity of three months or less, resulting in net presentation of proceeds and repayments of short-term debt in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nOther Short-term Debt\nIn addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time to time, Bunge Global SA and/or its financing subsidiaries may enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines. Loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $875 million and $797 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to support working capital requirements. The original maturity of borrowings under uncommitted bilateral credit lines and local bank lines of credit varies based upon the Company's financing objectives. As a result, proceeds and repayments of such credit lines may be presented on a net basis, or separately, in the consolidated statements of cash flows as dictated by the borrowing's original maturity.\nViterra Acquisition Financing\nAs described in Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions, Bunge secured a total of $8.0 billion in Acquisition Financing in the form of a $7.7 billion financing commitment from a consortium of lenders, arranged by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a $300 million 5-year delayed draw term loan from CoBank and the U.S. farm credit system executed July 7, 2023 that may be drawn upon the closing of the Acquisition. As a result of the Senior Notes issuance discussed further below, the $7.7 billion financing commitment has been reduced to $5.7 billion. The $5.7 billion financing commitment is in the form of a three tranche term loan maturing 364-days, 2-years and 3-years from closing of the Acquisition.\nSenior Notes - On September 17, 2024, Bunge completed the sale and issuance of (i) $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% senior notes due 2028, (ii) $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% senior notes due 2029, and (iii) $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.650% senior notes due 2034. Collectively, the three tranches of Senior Notes total an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge. The offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-282003) filed by the Company and its 100% owned finance subsidiary, BLFC, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $1.98 billion after deducting underwriting commissions, the original issue discount, and offering fees and expenses payable by Bunge. The net proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for Bunge's Acquisition of Viterra and to repay a portion of certain Viterra debt to be assumed in connection with the Acquisition, including, in each case, related fees and expenses, and, with any remaining amounts, for general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, under certain circumstances, including if the Acquisition of Viterra is not consummated or the Acquisition is not consummated by an agreed upon date per the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. \nExchange Offers and Consent Solicitations of Viterra Notes - On September 9, 2024, Bunge announced that, in connection with its pending Acquisition of Viterra, Bunge's 's wholly-owned subsidiary, BLFC, commenced US Exchange Offers to exchange all outstanding notes of certain series (the \"Existing USD Viterra Notes\") issued by VFBV and guaranteed by Viterra and Viterra B.V., for up to $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by BLFC and guaranteed by Bunge. \nConcurrently with the US Exchange Offers, BLFC successfully solicited consents, on behalf of VFBV, and VFBV amended the respective indentures governing the Existing USD Viterra Notes on September 23, 2024 to, among other things, eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default, and modify or amend certain other provisions, including unconditionally releasing and discharging the guarantees by each of Viterra and Viterra B.V. \nIn addition, in the third quarter of 2024, Viterra commenced the European Consent Solicitation to amend the indenture governing VFBV's outstanding 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 0.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and outstanding 700 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 1.000% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (collectively, the \"Existing Euro Viterra Notes\") to, among other things, substitute the issuer and guarantors of such notes with BFE, a wholly \nF-49\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nowned finance subsidiary of Bunge, as issuer, and Bunge as guarantor. The resolutions to effect such amendments have been passed by the requisite number of noteholders. \nThe US Exchange Offers and European Consent Solicitation are conditioned, among other things, upon the consummation of the Acquisition. For this reason, the Existing USD Viterra Notes and Existing Euro Viterra Notes are not recognized on Bunge's condensed consolidated balance sheet, until consummation of the Acquisition. \nLong-term Debt\nCertain property, plant and equipment, and investments in consolidated subsidiaries having a net carrying value of approximately $170 million at December 31, 2024 have been mortgaged or otherwise collateralized against long-term debt, including current portion, of $139 million at December 31, 2024.\nPrincipal Maturities—Principal maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2024 are as follows:\n\n    (US$ in millions)               \n                 2025        $690\n                 2026         720\n                 2027         907\n                 2028         659\n                 2029         805\n           Thereafter       1,882\n            Total (1)      $5,663\n(1)Includes components of long-term debt attributable to unamortized debt issuance costs of $32 million and excludes components of long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $269 million. Includes principal maturities of long-term debt attributable to finance leases, see Note 25- Leases for a separate breakout of finance lease maturities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $434 million, $507 million, and $403 million, respectively.\n18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nCertain of Bunge's United States, Canadian, European, Asian, and Brazilian-based subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of such subsidiaries. The plans provide benefits primarily based on participant salaries and lengths of service. The funding policies for Bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The most significant defined benefit plan is in the United States. \nCertain of Bunge's United States and Brazilian-based subsidiaries have benefit plans to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible retired employees of those subsidiaries. The plans require minimum retiree contributions and define the maximum amount the subsidiaries will be obligated to pay under the plans. Bunge's policy is to fund these costs as they become payable.\n Plan amendments and pension liability adjustments—On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. As a result, these plans were closed to new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018 and future benefit accruals for existing participants ceased effective January 1, 2023.\nFuture Plan Settlements— On October 2, 2024, the Company, as plan sponsor for one of Bunge's defined benefit U.S. pension plans (the \"U.S. Pension Plan\"), utilized approximately $377 million of plan assets to purchase an equally valued buy-in contract from a third-party insurer. The insurance buy-in contract is a group annuity contract that is expected to provide an income stream to cover a significant majority of the cash flows arising for the plan population with future contracted payments. However, the benefit obligation remains with the plan and the Company. To further clarify, the buy-in is not a settlement. On October 22, 2024, the Company notified plan participants in the U.S. Pension Plan of its intent to offer a lump sum buyout to eligible participants and terminate the plan, which is expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal year 2025. In connection with the plan termination, the buy-in contract allows for the future conversion into a buy-out arrangement where the \nF-50\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ninsurance company would assume full responsibility for the U.S. Pension Plan obligations, at which time the Company would derecognize the remaining assets and liabilities of the U.S. Pension Plan and realize a settlement gain or loss as a component of net periodic benefit costs. Given the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plan, the Company does not expect the transaction to result in material cash inflows or outflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The insurance contract had a fair value of $362 million at December 31, 2024 and was valued on an insurer pricing basis, which approximates fair value.\nPlan Settlements— On June 30, 2023, the Company approved a one-time lump sum offering to participants in certain of Bunge's defined benefit North American pension plans who had separated from the Company as of December 31, 2022 and whose benefits in the plan had fully vested. The respective payments were substantially completed during September 2023. The payments, which were paid from plan assets as settlement of respective benefit obligations, resulted in a $22 million decrease in benefit obligations and the reclassification of an unamortized gain of less than $1 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which was recorded in Other income (expense) - net on the consolidated statements of income.\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company’s international defined-benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition, the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, resulting in full settlement of the related defined-benefit plan obligations. In connection with the settlement, during the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $41 million pretax gain within Other income (expense) - net in its consolidated statements of income, comprising a $4 million settlement of the related defined benefit plan obligations as well as the reclassification of $37 million in unamortized actuarial gains from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Of this pretax gain, $12 million was attributable to Redeemable non-controlling interests.\nPlan Transfers In and Out—There were no significant transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nCost of Benefit Plans—Service cost is recognized in a period determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during that period. Interest cost is the amount recognized in a period determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. Amortization of net loss represents the recognition in net periodic cost over several periods of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive (loss) income. Service cost is included in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while the other components of net periodic benefit pension cost are presented separately in Other (expense) income- net.\nThe components of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n\n                                                                                      Pension Benefits                                              Postretirement Benefits\n                                                                                          December 31,                                                         December 31,\n(US$ in millions)                             2024                      2023                      2022                 2024                    2023                    2022\nService cost                               $11                       $10                       $29                   $—                      $—                      $—    \nInterest cost                               38                        41                        30                    3                       4                       3    \nExpected return on plan assets            (47)                      (46)                      (52)                    —                       —                       —    \nAmortization of net loss (gain)              3                         3                         5                  (1)                     (1)                       —    \nCurtailment gain                             —                         —                       (4)                    —                       —                       —    \nSettlement gain recognized                   —                         —                      (36)                    —                       —                       —    \nNet periodic benefit costs                  $5                        $8                     $(28)                   $2                      $3                      $3    \nAssumptions used in Postretirement Benefits Calculations—At December 31, 2024, an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2024 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 8.1% by 2048, and remaining at that level thereafter. At December 31, 2023, an 8.8% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2023 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 8.2% by 2048, and remaining at that level thereafter.\nF-51\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n\n                                                              Pension Benefits                               Postretirement Benefits\n                                                                  December 31,                                          December 31,\n2024                                                                      2023                    2024                          2023\nDiscount rate                                  4.2   %                 4.8   %               11.3   %                       9.2   % \nIncrease in future compensation levels         2.1   %                 2.2   %                     N/A                           N/A\nThe weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic benefit cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n\n                                                                                            Pension Benefits                                              Postretirement Benefits\n                                                                                                December 31,                                                         December 31,\n2024                                                                            2023                    2022                 2024                    2023                    2022\nDiscount rate                                        4.8   %                 5.2   %                 2.5   %              9.2   %                 9.6   %                 7.5   %\nExpected long-term rate of return on assets          6.7   %                 6.5   %                 5.0   %                  N/A                     N/A                     N/A\nIncrease in future compensation levels               2.2   %                 2.4   %                 3.2   %                  N/A                     N/A                     N/A\nThe sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.\nIn estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held, or anticipated to be held, by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that it would affect the expected returns. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes. For the U.S. Pension Plan, the anticipated long-term rate of return is equal to the discount rate.\nFor certain of Bunge’s plans, the discount rate is determined by 1) the yield on a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flow effectively settles the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows or 2) matching either the duration or the expected cash flows for the pension plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed on a region-specific basis using a portfolio of available high quality, non-callable, make-whole corporate bonds.

For the U.S. Pension Plan, Bunge updated its investment strategy to prepare for a lump sum buyout as discussed above. The investment strategy of the other US plans is intended to increase the interest rate and credit spread liability hedge ratios and reduce the funded status volatility of the US plans. Target asset allocations are based on a glide path approach, which allocates more plan assets to immunizing assets, such as intermediate and long duration fixed income instruments, which are intended to match the duration and amount of the expected liabilities, and less to growth assets, such as public equities, non-core fixed income instruments and real assets, as the funded status of the plans improve. Target asset allocations are generally 80-90% to immunizing assets and 10-20% to growth assets. For pension plans outside of the United States, the plans’ trust funds utilize a target asset allocation of approximately 30% fixed income securities, approximately 35% equities and approximately 35% in real estate and other alternative investment vehicles. \nBunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of passive and actively managed strategies, including, but not limited to mutual funds, collective trust funds, and collective investment trusts. The Company's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge Global SA shares. Plan investments are stated at fair value or net asset value (\"NAV\"). For a further definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.\nF-54\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nThe fair values of Bunge's defined benefit pension plans' assets at the measurement date, by category, are as follows:\n\n                                                                                                                                             December 31, 2024\n(US$ in millions)                                                               Level 1                 Level 2                 Level 3                  Total\nCash                                                                          $114                      $—                      $—                    $114    \nInsurance contract (1)                                                           —                       —                     362                     362    \nMutual funds - equities (2)                                                     70                       —                       —                      70    \nMutual funds - fixed income (3)                                                 41                      21                       —                      62    \nOther (4)                                                                        2                      45                       8                      55    \nTotal                                                                         $227                     $66                    $370                    $663    \nCollective pooled funds (5)                                                     $—                      $—                      $—                     $69    \nTotal investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient                       —                       —                       —                      69    \nTotal                                                                         $227                     $66                    $370                    $732    \n\n                                                                                                                                             December 31, 2023\n(US$ in millions)                                                               Level 1                 Level 2            Level 3                       Total\nCash                                                                           $45                      $—                 $—                          $45    \nMutual funds - equities (2)                                                     62                       —                 —                            62    \nMutual funds - fixed income (3)                                                 41                      31                 —                            72    \nOther (4)                                                                        3                      45        6                                     54    \nTotal                                                                         $151                     $76                 $6                         $233    \nCollective pooled funds (5)                                                     $—                      $—                 $—                         $478    \nTotal investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient                       —                       —                 —                           478    \nTotal                                                                         $151                     $76                 $6                         $711    \n(1)This category represents the buy-in contract related to the U.S. Pension Plan and was valued on an insurer pricing basis, which reflects the purchase price adjusted for movements in market indicators.\n(2)This category represents a portfolio of equity investments comprised of equity index funds that invest in U.S. equities and non-U.S. equities. The U.S. equities are comprised of investments focusing on large, mid and small cap companies and non-U.S. equities are comprised of international, emerging markets, and real estate investment trusts.\n(3)This category represents a portfolio of fixed income investments in mutual funds comprised of investment grade U.S. government bonds and notes, foreign government bonds, and corporate bonds from diverse industries.\n(4)This category represents a portfolio consisting of a mixture of hedge funds, investments in certain government and municipal securities, bonds, real estate, and insurance contracts.\n(5)Collective pooled funds are typically collective trusts valued at NAV that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity.

Contributions to these plans amounted to $48 million, $43 million, and $28 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nBunge purchases agricultural commodity products from certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party purchases comprised approximately 9% or less of total Cost of goods sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Bunge also sells agricultural commodity products to certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party sales comprised approximately 2% or less of total Net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. \nIn addition, Bunge receives services from and provides services to its unconsolidated investees, including tolling, port handling, administrative support, and other services. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, such services were not material to the Company's consolidated results. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, receivables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 4% or less of total Trade accounts receivable, net. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, payables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 3% or less of total Trade accounts payable.\nFurther, as referenced in Note 6- Other Current Assets and Note 12- Other Non-Current Assets, Bunge provides certain advance payments for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities and advances to its unconsolidated investees. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, advances to unconsolidated investees comprised approximately 4% or less of total Other current assets and 6% or less of total Other non-current assets.\nBunge believes all transaction values to be similar to those that would be conducted with third parties at arm's-length.\n20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nBunge is party to claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in South America, arising in the normal course of business. Bunge is also involved from time to time in various contract, antitrust, environmental litigation and remediation, and other litigation, claims, government investigations and legal proceedings. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to legal matters when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility that a liability arising from these matters could have a material adverse impact in the period the uncertainties are resolved should the liability substantially exceed the \nF-56\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\namount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets.

The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, certain Bunge subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced. Based on the amounts drawn under guaranteed debt facilities of unconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2024, Bunge's potential liability was $131 million, and it has recorded $13 million of obligations related to these guarantees within Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities.\n(2)Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars, barges and buildings.

EQUITY\nRedomestication— In connection with the Redomestication noted in Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies, one registered share, par value $0.01 per share, of Bunge Global SA was exchanged for, each issued and outstanding Bunge Limited common share, par value $0.01 per share. In connection with the non-cash exchange on November 1, 2023, Bunge Global SA acquired 16,141,494 treasury shares which, following the Redomestication, have been included in the general treasury share population available for use in satisfying Bunge’s obligations to deliver registered shares. \nTreasury Shares— In connection with the Redomestication, 8,102,179 shares held in treasury with an acquisition cost of $845 million were cancelled in a non-cash transaction to comply with the Swiss Code limitation on issuer’s holding of registered share capital. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Bunge Global SA cancelled 6,146,930 shares held in treasury totaling $572 million. \nShare Repurchase Program— On November 13, 2024, Bunge Global SA's Board approved the expansion of an existing share repurchase program by an additional $500 million bringing total authorizations under the program since inception to $2.7 billion. The program continues to have an indefinite term. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 19,667,739 shares were repurchased under the program for $1.9 billion with an aggregate purchase authorization of approximately $800 million remaining outstanding for repurchases under the program. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, Bunge repurchased 12,150,763 shares for $1.1 billion.\nCumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares— Effective March 23, 2022, (the \"Conversion Date\"), in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation governing the 4.875% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares (\"convertible preference shares\"), all of the Company's issued and outstanding convertible preference shares were automatically converted into 1.2846 common shares of the Company, par value $0.01 per share. There were 6,898,268 convertible preference shares issued and outstanding prior to the conversion, which resulted in the issuance of 8,861,515 new common shares of the Company. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2022, prior to the conversion, 1,415 convertible preference shares were voluntarily converted by preference shareholders into 1,816 common shares. As a result of this conversion, no convertible preference shares were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and all rights of the former holders of the convertible preference shares terminated, as of March 23, 2022. \nDividends on the convertible preference shares ceased to accrue on the Conversion Date. Accordingly, holders of the convertible preference shares were not entitled to receive the $1.21875 per share dividend declared by the Company in respect of the convertible preference shares on February 23, 2022, and payable to holders of record on May 15, 2022. \nDividends on registered shares—We paid cash dividends to shareholders as follows:\n\n                                 Year Ended December 31,                                          \n                                             2024                        2023                        2022               \nDividends paid per share                                   $2.7025                      $2.575                  $2.30   \n\nDividend distributions occurring after the Redomestication are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the approval of shareholders at a general meeting in accordance with Swiss law. On May 15, 2024, shareholders of Bunge Global SA approved a cash dividend distribution in the amount of $2.72 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.68 per share beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and ending in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. \nUpon approval of a dividend, the obligation is reflected in Other current liabilities with a corresponding reduction in Retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2024, and 2023, the unpaid portion of the dividends accrued in Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets totaled $91 million and $96 million, respectively, see Note

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn connection with the Redomestication effective as of November 1, 2023, Bunge amended the Bunge Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2016 EIP\"), the Bunge 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2017 NED Plan\" or collectively, referred to as the \"Plans\") to provide for the issuance of registered shares instead of common shares in connection with the awards under the Plans. Additionally, the amendments to the Plans include changes to comply with Swiss law regarding minimum payment for shares, share sourcing, the form of shares, data protection, and forfeiture of restricted shares along with modifying the vesting provision on the 2017 NED Plan for separation. \nOn May 15, 2024, Bunge established the Bunge 2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2024 LTIP\"), which allows for an additional issue of 5,000,000 shares and replaced the 2016 EIP, under which, beginning May 15, 2024, no further awards may be granted.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Bunge recognized approximately $65 million, $69 million, and $65 million, respectively, of total compensation expense related to its stock option and restricted stock unit equity awards. \nF-61\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2024 LTIP and the 2016 EIP, both shareholder approved plans. Under the 2024 LTIP and the 2016 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants, and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-based) or other equity-based awards. Shares issued under the 2024 LTIP and the 2016 EIP may result from, in whole or in part, the capital band referenced in Bunge's articles of association, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof. \nStock Option Awards—Options to purchase Bunge registered shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge registered shares, vest over service periods that generally range from one to three years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated award agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Bunge elected to cease awarding stock options to its employees beginning January 1, 2021. All awards previously granted have vested and have varying expiration dates through 2030.\nRestricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") give recipients the right to receive Bunge registered shares upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company has two types of RSUs: time-based restricted stock units (\"TBRSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PBRSUs\"). Restrictions on TBRSUs are based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term. Restrictions on PBRSUs are based on the achievement of certain performance targets, including earnings per share, return on invested capital, and relative total shareholder return, with the number of PBRSUs earned varying based on the level of achievement against these performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs generally vest over periods ranging from one to three years. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated award agreements. RSUs are generally settled in Bunge registered shares upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. In locations where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.\nUnder the 2017 NED Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Global SA. Awards may consist of restricted stock, RSUs, deferred RSUs, and non-statutory stock options.\nRSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in Bunge registered shares. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.\nThe fair value of each stock option granted under any of the Plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, utilizing inputs such as the expected volatility of Bunge registered shares, historical employee exercise behavior, the expected outstanding option term, and the risk-free interest rate associated with U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds. \nA summary of option activity under the

At December 31, 2024, 4,958,767 and 131,642 registered shares were available for future grants under the 2024 LTIP Plan and 2017 NED Plan, respectively. No shares are currently available for grant under any other Bunge Global SA equity incentive plan.\n25. LEASES\nThe Company routinely leases storage facilities, transportation equipment, land, and office facilities which are typically classified as operating leases. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of renewal or termination options. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (Operating lease assets) and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases (Current operating lease obligations and Non-current operating lease obligations). As of the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially measured as the present value of lease payments not yet paid. The lease asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement (e.g., prepaid rent), lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. Over time, the lease liability is reduced for lease payments made and the lease asset is reduced through expense, classified as either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the lease. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment in a manner consistent with property, plant and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or \nF-63\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nless (\"short-term leases\") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s operating leases range in length of term, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years, and a maximum remaining term of 87 years for one water rights lease. Renewal options are generally exercisable solely at the Company’s discretion. When a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, such additional terms are considered when calculating the associated operating lease asset and liability. When determining the lease liability at commencement of the lease, the present value of lease payments is generally based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined using a portfolio approach and the Company’s incremental cost of debt, adjusted to arrive at the rate in the applicable country and for the applicable term of the lease, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2024, such weighted average discount rate on operating leases was 4.7%. \nCertain of the Company’s freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and rail cars may include rental payments that are variable in nature. Variable payments on time charter agreements for ocean freight vessels under freight supply agreements are dependent on then current market daily hire rates. Variable payments for certain rail cars can be based on volumes, and in some cases, benchmark interest rates. All such variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are not included in the calculation of the associated operating lease asset or liability subsequent to the inception date of the associated lease and are recorded as expense in the period in which the adjustment to the variable payment obligation is incurred. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements related to railcars and barges contain residual value guarantees (see Note 20- Commitments and Contingencies). None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material restrictive covenants.\n    The components of lease expense were as follows:\n\n                                                     Year Ended December 31,\n(US$ in millions)                       2024                            2023\nOperating lease cost               $420                            $507     \nShort-term lease cost             1,054                             747     \nVariable lease cost                  42                              47     \nTotal lease cost                 $1,516                          $1,301     \n\nThe table below presents the finance lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets:\n\n                                                                            December 31,\n(US$ in millions)                                         2024                      2023\nProperty, plant and equipment                         $151                      $124    \nLess: accumulated depreciation and depletion          (44)                      (36)    \nProperty, plant and equipment, net                    $107                       $88    \nCurrent portion of long-term debt                       $7                        $3    \nLong-term debt                                          80                        57    \nTotal finance lease liabilities                        $87                       $60    \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n\n                                                                                                 Year Ended December 31,\n(US$ in millions)                                                                     2024                          2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:                                                 \nOperating lease liability principal payments                                     $421                          $506     \nSupplemental non-cash information:                                                                                      \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (1)               $449                          $403     \n (1) Comprises both operating and finance lease obligations.\nF-64\n\n\nBUNGE GLOBAL SA AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n    Maturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n\n(US$ in millions)                                                                                                   Operating leases                Finance leases\n2025                                                                                                                    $315                            $12       \n2026                                                                                                                     220                             12       \n2027                                                                                                                     134                              9       \n2028                                                                                                                      93                              8       \n2029                                                                                                                      50                              7       \nThereafter                                                                                                               265                             93       \nTotal lease payments (1)                                                                                               1,077                            141       \nLess imputed interest                                                                                                  (196)                           (54)       \nPresent value of lease liabilities, as separately presented on the consolidated balance sheet                           $881                            $87       \n(1)Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income receipts of $57 million due in future periods under non-cancelable subleases as of December 31, 2024. Non-cancelable subleases primarily relate to agreements with third parties for the use of portions of certain facilities with remaining sublease terms of up to five years. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may enter into re-let agreements to sell the right to use ocean freight vessels under time charter agreements when excess capacity is available. Sublease income, generally recorded within Net sales, was $229 million and $176 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n    The Company is expected to have additional operating lease payments, primarily for ocean freight vessels that have not yet commenced, of $526 million. The operating leases are expected to commence between 2025 and 2027, with lease terms ranging between three and 48 years.\n26. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company's operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable segments - Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other.\nThe Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment involves the processing, production, and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling segment involves the processing, production, and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. The Sugar & Bioenergy segment primarily comprises the net earnings from the Company’s 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP. On October 1, 2024, Bunge completed the sale of our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia to BP. See Note 2- Acquisitions and Dispositions for further information.\nCorporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of each reporting segment is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance activities, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities. \nTransfers between the segments are valued at market.

Total reportable segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") is the key operating performance measure utilized by the CODM to evaluate reportable segment operating activities and performance. The CODM believes total reportable segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its reportable segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge’s industries. Further, the CODM uses total reportable segment EBIT to evaluate earnings generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest earnings into a particular segment or into other parts of the entity, such as for acquisitions.

      "text": "Item 1A.    Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\n Our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our financial condition and business operations. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industries\nAdverse weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may adversely affect the availability, quality and price of agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products, as well as our operations, supply chains, and operating results.\nAdverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products, and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us.\nSevere adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes and severe storms, have historically and may in the future also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries, and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services, including transportation by ocean vessel, river barges, rail, and truck. A disruption in transportation services as a result of weather conditions, such as low river levels following periods of drought, has historically and may in the future also have an adverse impact on our operations and related supply chains.\nAdditionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region. These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, \nshifts in agricultural production areas, changing temperature levels, increased frequency or severity of extreme weather events, and climatic volatility. The frequency and severity of the effects of climate change or weather patterns could increase and adversely impact our business operations, the location, costs and competitiveness of global agricultural commodity production and related storage and processing facilities, as well as the supply and demand for agricultural commodities, and may result in incidents of stranded physical assets. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe maintain operations in Ukraine. Ukraine forms part of a key international grain originating region and is also the world’s largest supplier of sunflower seed and sunflower oil, commodities that cannot be completely replaced from other origins. On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military offensive in Ukraine. Bunge’s Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in the Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates a corn milling facility and oilseed processor in Ukraine via joint ventures. Assets and operations located in regions affected by the war are at a heightened risk of property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. Further, no material damage has been noted at any of Bunge’s Ukrainian facilities, however, due to safety concerns, it is not always possible to conduct onsite physical inspections of our Ukrainian facilities to understand the full extent of the impact of the war. As of December 31, 2024, total assets and total liabilities associated with Bunge's Ukrainian subsidiaries each comprise less than 3% of our consolidated Total assets and Total liabilities, respectively.\nOur Ukrainian operations employ approximately 1,000 employees. While as of the date of this Annual Report some of our Ukrainian employees have been forced to relocate to other areas within Ukraine or to other countries, our workforce remains largely intact. The ongoing war could cause harm to our employees and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Disruption to the power grid, transportation routes, telecommunications systems, banks, and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Ukraine could also severely impair our Ukrainian operations. The scope, intensity, duration and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and the continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s assets, operations and financial condition.\nWe divested our Russian operations in February 2023 and we no longer maintain any operations in Russia.\nIn addition, the risk of cybersecurity incidents has increased in connection with the ongoing war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or in response to certain companies' continued operations in Russia. See \"— Our information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\"\nAlthough we insure ourselves against many types of risks, including certain risks associated with the ongoing war, our level of insurance may not cover all losses we could incur. There could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are not able to adequately insure against the possible exposure we could experience as a result of the war. To the extent the current war adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Item 1A, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to the continuously evolving nature of the war, the potential impact that the war could have on these risk factors, and others that cannot yet be identified, remains uncertain. Even if the war moderates, or a resolution between Ukraine and Russia is reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing financial and operational impacts resulting from the war for the foreseeable future as Ukraine rebuilds its economy and infrastructure.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices, energy prices, and other factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our operating results.\nPrices for agricultural commodities and their by-products, including, among others, soybeans, corn, wheat, sugar and ethanol, like those of other commodities, are often volatile and sensitive to local and international changes in supply and demand caused by factors outside of our control, including farmer planting and selling decisions, currency fluctuations, inflation, government agriculture programs and policies (including tariffs), pandemics, governmental restrictions or mandates, global inventory levels, demand for biofuels, weather and crop conditions, and demand for and supply of competing commodities and substitutes. These factors may cause volatility in our operating results.\nAdditionally, our operating costs and the selling prices of certain of our products are sensitive to changes in energy prices. Our industrial operations utilize significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and coal, and our transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Significant increases in the cost of these items, including as a result of the Ukraine-Russia war, and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our operating costs and results. We also sell certain biofuel products, such as ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, \npetroleum products. As a result, the selling prices of ethanol, renewable diesel, and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of oil, gasoline and diesel fuel. In turn, the selling prices of the agricultural commodities and commodity products that we sell, such as corn and vegetable oils that are used as feedstocks for biofuels, are also sensitive to changes in the market price for biofuels, and consequently world petroleum prices. Prices for petroleum products and biofuels are affected by market and geopolitical factors and government fuel policies, over which we have no control. Lower prices for oil, gasoline or diesel fuel could result in decreased selling prices for ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel and their raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. \nOur business is seasonal, and our results may fluctuate depending on the harvest cycle of the crops upon which we rely and seasonal fluctuations related to the sale of our consumer products.\nAs with any agricultural business enterprise, our business operations are seasonal in nature. For example, in our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American oilseed harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, while the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. This creates price fluctuations, which result in fluctuations in our inventories and a degree of seasonality in our gross profit. In addition, certain of our consumer food products are influenced by holidays and other annual events. Seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. In addition, our quarterly results may vary as a result of the effects of fluctuations in commodities prices, production yields and costs. \nWe face intense competition in each of our businesses.\nWe face significant competition in each of our businesses and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger, more diversified and have greater financial resources than we have. Additionally, in recent years we have experienced regional Agribusiness competitors entering new geographies where previously they did not compete with us, and certain customers seeking to procure certain commodities directly rather than through historical suppliers such as us. Furthermore, in conjunction with the recent increase in demand for renewable biodiesel feedstocks, we have experienced added competition for refining capacity from traditional petroleum companies. As many of the products we sell are global commodities, the markets for our products are highly price competitive, and in many cases also sensitive to product substitution. Additionally, the geographic location of assets can competitively advantage or disadvantage us with respect to our competitors in certain regions. We also face competition from changing technologies and shifting industry practices, such as increased on-farm crop storage in several regions, which allows producers to retain commodities for extended periods and increase price pressure on purchasers such as us. To compete effectively, we must continuously focus on improving efficiency in our production and distribution operations, including through business optimization initiatives, developing and offering products that meet customer needs, optimizing our geographic presence in key markets, developing and maintaining appropriate market share and customer relationships, supporting socially responsible and sustainable corporate and business practices, and promoting our environmental stewardship. We also compete for talent in our industries, particularly commercial personnel. Competition could cause us to lose market share and talented employees, exit certain lines of business, increase marketing or other expenditures, increase our raw material costs or reduce pricing, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. \nWe are vulnerable to the effects of supply and demand imbalances in our industries.\nHistorically, the market for some agricultural commodities and fertilizer products has been cyclical, with periods of high demand and capacity utilization stimulating new plant investment and the addition of incremental processing or production capacity by industry participants to meet the demand. The timing and extent of this expansion may then produce excess supply conditions in the market, which, until the supply/demand balance is again restored, negatively impacts product prices and operating results. During times of reduced market demand, we may suspend or reduce production at some of our facilities. The extent to which we efficiently manage available capacity at our facilities will affect our profitability, including the profitability of our Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables joint venture (\"Bunge Chevron JV\"). The business and financial performance of the Bunge Chevron JV may be adversely affected if there is a significant decrease in demand for renewable diesel. \nWe are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks.\nThe level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographic and macroeconomic conditions, including population growth rates and changes in standards of living. A significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions, may lead to reduced demand for agricultural commodities and food products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets, such as inflation, increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, uncertainty about economic stability, political unrest, wars or other armed conflicts, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products.\nAdditionally, weak global economic conditions and adverse conditions in global financial and capital markets, including fluctuating interest rates and constraints on the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the financial condition and creditworthiness of the financial institutions that serve as our lenders and as counterparties to the over-the-counter derivative instruments we use to manage risks and some of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties, which in turn may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for more information.\nMany of the raw materials that we use can be subject to periods of rapid and significant cost instability. In 2024, we experienced fluctuations, both increases and decreases, in our raw material input costs and we expect the pressures of input cost instability to continue. While the Brazilian economy performed more strongly than expected in 2024, interest rates and government deficit levels remain high, which may restrain further economic growth. Argentina has significantly reduced public spending and showed a slowing in inflation under the current President of Argentina’s austerity measures, but the sustainability of these measures and the prospect of economic recovery remains uncertain. Additionally, a slowdown in China's economy over a prolonged period, including as a result of tensions with the west, population decline, real estate crisis and other factors, could lead to reduced global demand for agricultural commodities. To the extent that such economic and political conditions negatively impact consumer and business confidence and consumption patterns or volumes, our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to economic, political, and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets.\nWe are a global business with a substantial majority of our assets and operations located outside the United States. In addition, our business strategies may involve expanding or developing our business in emerging market regions, including Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Due to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to various risks of international operations, including:\n•adverse trade policies or trade barriers on agricultural commodities and commodity products;\n•new and developing requirements related to GHG emissions and other climate change initiatives and workforce diversity and inclusion mandates;\n•inflation, hyperinflation, and adverse economic effects resulting from governmental attempts to control inflation, such as the imposition of wage and price controls and higher interest rates. For example, inflation rates in many countries in which we operate are currently at the highest levels in decades, resulting in tighter monetary policies, including higher interest rates; \n•changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement in the countries in which we operate, including the effects of complying with Swiss tax law on us and our shareholders;\n•difficulties in enforcing agreements or judgments and collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n•exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitations on the movement of funds, such as on the remittance of dividends by subsidiaries, most notably in Ukraine, Egypt, and Argentina;\n•inadequate infrastructure and logistics challenges;\n•sovereign risk and the risk of government intervention, including through expropriation, or regulation of the economy or natural resources, including restrictions on foreign ownership of land or other assets;\n•the requirement to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that apply to international operations, including, without limitation, economic sanctions regulations, labor laws, import and export regulations, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, as well as other laws or regulations discussed in this \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" section;\n•challenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment with operations in multiple international locations, including language differences, varying levels of U.S. GAAP expertise in international locations and multiple financial information systems; \n•changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political condition; and\n•labor disruptions, civil unrest, significant political instability, coup attempts, wars or other armed conflict or acts of terrorism, such as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. See also \"—The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\"\nThese risks could adversely affect our operations, business strategies, and operating results.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are also exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, the euro, and Chinese yuan/renminbi affect our revenues and expenses that are denominated in local currencies, affect farm economics in those regions and may also have a negative impact on the value of our assets located outside of the United States.\nAdditionally, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding U.S. and global trade policies for companies with \nmultinational operations like ours. In recent years, there has been an increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and consequently historical free trade principles are being challenged. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such changes and how well we are able to anticipate, respond to and effectively manage any such changes. \nGovernment policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nAgricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes (including \"windfall profits\" taxes), tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions, price controls on agricultural commodities, and energy policies (including biofuels mandates), can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. Additionally, regulation of financial markets and instruments in the United States and internationally may create uncertainty as these laws are adopted and implemented and may impose significant additional risks and costs that could impact our risk management practices. Further, increases in food and fertilizer prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of our industries under antitrust and competition laws in various jurisdictions and increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted, administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operations or impose liabilities on us that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions impacting our industries may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business in existing and target markets, or engage in risk management activities and otherwise cause our financial results to suffer.\nIn addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions, particularly disputes involving the United States and China. For example, prior trade disputes between the United States and China have led both countries to implement tariffs on imported goods. An implementation of tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural products into China could result in the reinstatement or escalation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products by China. This has in the past led, and can in the future lead, to significant volatility in commodity prices, disruptions in historical trade flows and shifts in planting patterns in the United States and South America, which have presented challenges and uncertainties for our business. We cannot predict the impact that future trade policy or negotiated trade agreements could have on our business and operations. Additionally, failure to resolve any trade dispute between the countries may also lead to unexpected operating difficulties, enhanced regulatory scrutiny, greater difficulty transferring funds, and negative currency impacts.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures.\nWe have been an active acquirer of other companies, including our pending acquisition of Viterra. We also have joint ventures with several partners, including the Bunge Chevron JV for manufacturing low lifecycle carbon intensity transportation fuels. Part of our strategy involves acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures designed to expand or optimize our portfolio of businesses. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable prospects, access funding sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms, and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire. In addition, we proactively review our portfolio of businesses in order to identify opportunities to enhance shareholder value and may decide as a result of such reviews or otherwise, from time to time, to divest certain of our assets or businesses by selling them or entering into joint ventures, such as the divestiture of our 50% ownership share in BP Bunge Bioenergia in October 2024 and the pending divestiture of 40% of our Spanish operating subsidiary Bunge Iberica SA. Our ability to successfully complete a divestiture will depend on, among other things, our ability to identify buyers that are prepared to acquire such assets or businesses on acceptable terms and to adjust and optimize our retained businesses following the divestiture.\nOur acquisition, joint venture, or divestiture activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. If we encounter unexpected problems with acquisitions, joint ventures, or divestitures, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions.\nAcquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, the controls and policies we implement at acquired companies, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. A material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition. Additionally, acquisitions involve other risks, such as differing levels of management and internal control \neffectiveness at the acquired entities, systems integration risks, the risk of impairment charges relating to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, the risk of significant accounting charges and expenses resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition, the need to fund increased capital expenditures and working capital requirements, our ability to retain and motivate employees of acquired entities, compliance and reputational risks and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. See the risk factors under the sections entitled \"Risks Relating to the Pending Viterra Acquisition\" and \"Risks Relating to the Combined Company\" under this Item 1A for additional discussions on our pending acquisition of Viterra.\nDivestitures may also expose us to potential liabilities or claims for indemnification, as we may be required to retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters, including legal, environmental, or litigation matters associated with the assets or businesses that we sell. For example, we agreed to indemnify BP against future losses associated with certain legal claims in connection with the divestiture of BP Bunge Bioenergia. In connection with the sale of our Russian operations in 2023, we agreed to indemnify the buyer against certain existing legal claims related to the business. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and its cost to us could ultimately exceed the proceeds we receive for the divested assets or businesses. Divestitures also have other inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and unexpected costs or other difficulties associated with the separation of the businesses to be sold from our information technology systems and other management processes, including the loss of key personnel. Further, expected cost savings or other anticipated efficiencies or benefits from divestitures may also be difficult to achieve or maximize.\nAdditionally, we have several joint ventures and investments in which we have limited control over governance, financial reporting, and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial, and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of our joint venture partners or their willingness to provide adequate funding for the joint venture, having differing objectives from our partners, the inability to implement some actions with respect to the joint venture's activities that we may believe are favorable if the joint venture partner does not agree, compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture or our partners, and the risk that we will be unable to effectively work with or resolve disputes with the joint venture partner. As a result, these investments may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows. \nWe are subject to industry and other risks that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results.\nWe are subject to food and feed industry risks which include, but are not limited to, spoilage, contamination, tampering or other adulteration of products, product liability claims, and recalls. We are also subject to shifts in customer and consumer preferences, and concerns regarding the outbreak of disease associated with livestock and poultry, including avian or swine influenza. Also, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns, and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on food companies and their suppliers, governmental intervention and consumer responses. These risks could adversely affect our, or our suppliers’, reputations and businesses and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business.\nAs a company whose products comprise staple food and feed products sold globally, as well as ingredients included in trusted food brands of our customers, maintaining a good corporate reputation is critical to our continued success. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, which can shift rapidly in response to negative incidents. The failure or alleged failure to maintain high standards for quality, safety, integrity, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, including with respect to raw materials and services obtained from suppliers, even if untrue, may result in tangible effects, such as reduced demand for our products, disruptions to our operations, increased costs and a loss of market share to competitors. Our reputation and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by changing consumer preferences and perceptions relating to some of the products we sell, such as with regard to the quantity and type of fats, sugars, and grains consumed, as well as concerns regarding genetically modified crops. Failure to anticipate, adapt or respond effectively to these trends or issues may result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations globally, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDue to our global business operations, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These include general business regulations, such as with respect to taxes, accounting, anti-corruption and fair competition, trade sanctions, product safety, and environmental matters, as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, and limitations on water use. In addition to liabilities arising out of our current and future operations for which we have ongoing processes to manage compliance with regulatory obligations, we may be subject to environmental liabilities for past operations at current facilities and in some cases \nto liabilities for past operations at facilities that we no longer own or operate. We may also be subject to liabilities for operations of acquired companies. Our industrial activities can also result in serious accidents that could result in personal injuries, facility shutdowns, reputational harm to our business and/or the expenditure of significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities. We may incur material costs or liabilities to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, and other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products, or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal or civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis in countries in which we operate on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation and natural resource management, have resulted in and could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight or other limitations on the agricultural industry, including increased environmental controls, land-use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business and the larger food production chain generate carbon emissions. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions, including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the EUDR, which becomes effective December 30, 2025 requires companies trading in certain commodities, including palm oil and soy, as well as products derived from these commodities, to ensure these commodities and related products do not result from deforestation, forest degradation, or breaches of local laws after December 31, 2020 in order to sell such products in the European Union. The imposition of regulatory restrictions related to GHG emissions and conservation in many markets in which we operate, which may include limitations on GHG emissions, national emission reduction plans, requirements to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes, other restrictions on industrial operations, taxes or fees on GHG emissions, and other measures, could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, and results of operations. We are also subject to a number of ESG disclosure frameworks, such as the CSRD in the European Union, the Swiss non-financial reporting requirements and child labor due diligence and transparency, and the California Climate Accountability Package, and as certain regulators increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability matters, we may become subject to new, more stringent ESG disclosure frameworks. See \"Item 1. Business-Government Regulation.\" \nWe are exposed to credit and counterparty risk relating to our customer and supplier counterparties in the ordinary course of business. In particular, we advance capital and provide other financing arrangements to farmers in Brazil and, as a result, our business and financial results may be adversely affected if these farmers are unable to repay the capital advanced to them.\nWe have various credit terms with customers, and our customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, which exposes us to the risk of non-payment or other default under our contracts and other arrangements with them. In the event that we experience significant defaults on their payment obligations to us, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn Brazil, where there have been limited third-party financing sources available to farmers, we provide financing to farmers from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances, which are generally intended to be short-term in nature and are typically secured by the farmer's crop and a mortgage on the farmer's land and other assets to provide a means of repayment in the potential event of crop failure or shortfall. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we had approximately $478 million and $825 million in outstanding prepaid commodity purchase contracts, and advances to farmers. We are exposed to the risk that the underlying crop will be insufficient to satisfy a farmer's obligation under the financing arrangements as a result of weather and crop growing conditions, and other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities. In addition, any collateral held by us as part of these financing transactions may not be sufficient to fully protect us from loss.\nWe are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and grow our business.\nWe require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures. Our working capital needs are directly affected by the prices of agricultural commodities, with increases in commodity prices generally causing increases in our borrowing levels. We are also required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade, and expand our extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, logistics assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances and safety and environmental standards. Furthermore, the expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require us to make significant investments into our business. Although we are selective with the capital expenditures and other investments we make, we may not realize the benefits of such capital expenditures and investments in the expected time frame, if at all. \nThe expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities also may require access to significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient external financing on attractive terms to fund these activities, including as a result of a tightening in the global credit markets, we may be forced to limit our operations and growth plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations. At December 31, 2024, Bunge had $5,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities with a number of financial institutions and we expect to have $3,000 million of additional committed borrowing capacity upon the completion of the Acquisition, resulting in anticipated capacity of $8,665 million upon the completion of the Acquisition. At December 31, 2024, our total debt balance was $6,238 million. Our debt levels could limit our ability to obtain additional financing, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are, and require us to dedicate more cash on a relative basis to servicing our debt and less to developing our business. This may limit our ability to run our business and use our resources in the manner in which we would like. Furthermore, difficult conditions in global credit or financial markets, including increases in interest rates and diminished liquidity and credit availability, generally could increase the cost to finance our operations, adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt or the cost or other terms of such refinancing, or adversely affect the financial position of the lenders with whom we do business, which may reduce our ability to obtain financing for our operations. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nAccess to credit markets and pricing of company debt is also dependent on maintaining appropriate credit ratings, and one of our financial objectives has been to maintain an investment grade credit rating. While our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt, reductions in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and, depending on their severity, could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms, as well as impair our ability to compete effectively relative to competitors with higher credit ratings.\nOur risk management strategies may not be effective.\nOur business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks. However, our exposures may not always be fully hedged, and our hedging strategies may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations. In addition, our risk management strategies may seek to position our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements. While we have implemented a broad range of risk monitoring and control procedures and policies to mitigate potential losses, they may not in all cases be successful in anticipating a significant risk exposure and protecting us from losses that have the potential to impair our financial position. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\".\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our manufacturing and distribution operations or other operations and systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are engaged in manufacturing and distribution activities on a global scale, and our business depends on our ability to execute and monitor, on a daily basis, a significant number of transactions across numerous markets or geographies. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, explosions, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, wars (including the Ukraine-Russia war and conflicts in the Middle East), acts of terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control. \nWhile we insure ourselves against many of these types of risks in accordance with industry standards, our level of insurance may not cover all losses. The potential effects of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches or failures that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe rely on certain key information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement and inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance, and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business. If we or our third-party service providers do not respond or perform effectively in connection with a cybersecurity breach or system failure, our business may be impacted.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a potentially significant risk to the security of our information technology systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the confidential data of our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties that we may hold. Such vulnerabilities include, among other things, social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, zero-day vulnerability exploits, and cyberattacks utilizing emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and machine learning. We may incur significant costs in protecting against potential security breaches, cyber-based attacks, or other cybersecurity incidents. We and our third-party service providers are targeted by malicious actors and expect such incidents to continue and the frequency and severity of such attacks to increase. Additionally, many of the third-party service providers we rely on use generative AI for a variety of purposes that increases the risk that our sensitive and proprietary data could be inadvertently or maliciously exposed. While we have implemented cybersecurity and data protection measures, our efforts to minimize the risks and impacts of cyberattacks and protect our information technology systems may be insufficient and we may experience significant breaches or other failures or disruptions that could compromise our systems and the information we store and, ultimately, affect our business operations and results of operations. Additionally, hybrid or remote work arrangements among our employees and employees of our third-party providers present additional operational risks to our information technology systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyberattacks and security breaches. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. New technology that could result in greater operational efficiency, such as the rapid development and increased adoption of AI technology, may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks, and may create the need for rapid modifications to our cybersecurity program. \nIn addition, political tensions, wars, or other military conflicts, and civil unrests also have an impact on the cybersecurity risk landscape. For example, cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government and other entities in the region, have increased in connection with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the war, or certain companies’ continued operations in Russia. It is possible that these attacks could have collateral effects on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally. While we no longer have operations in Russia, we do have operations in the region that, along with our operations globally, could be adversely affected by these attacks, including cyber-based attacks against our information technology systems, or be at risk to collateral effects of such attacks. While we have taken actions to mitigate such potential risks, the proliferation of malware from the war into systems unrelated to the war, or cyberattacks against U.S. companies in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia, or U.S. support of Ukraine, could also adversely affect our operations.\nWe have implemented security policies, training programs, measures and disaster recovery plans designed to prevent, detect and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and to protect the security and continuity of our networks and critical systems. We use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company and user data or accounts. In addition, we also conduct tests and assessments using independent third parties on a regular basis. We have also implemented data security measures on the use of generative AI, including blocking external generative AI tools within our IT environment and the rollout of an internal generative AI tool that does not share our data or train internal or external AI models. These measures, however, may not adequately prevent adverse events such as breaches or failures from occurring, or mitigate their severity if they do occur. \nIf our information technology systems are breached, damaged or fail to function properly due to any number of causes, such as security breaches or cyber-based attacks, systems implementation difficulties, catastrophic events or power outages, and our security, contingency disaster recovery, or other risk mitigation plans do not effectively mitigate these occurrences on a timely basis, we may experience a material disruption in our ability to manage our business operations and produce financial reports, as well as significant costs and lost business opportunities until they are remediated. Further, our sensitive information may be compromised and we may suffer representational harm. While we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise, and we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection, and data security, including laws related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal information. Data privacy regulations continue to evolve, and non-compliance with such regulations, including as a result of adoption of emerging \ntechnologies, such as AI, could subject the Company to legal claims or proceedings, potential regulatory fines and penalties and damage to our reputation. These factors may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our competitive position.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes, along with interest and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and assessments in order to assess the appropriateness of our tax assets and liabilities. However, the calculation of such liabilities involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a taxing authority may result in a payment or outcome that is significantly different from current estimates. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition in the periods in which they are recognized.\nAdditionally, changes in tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate and the monetization of recoverable tax assets (indirect tax credits). For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\") initiative, which is supported by governments of certain major countries and jurisdictions, seeks to, among other things, ensure large multinational companies, like Bunge, pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate, could adversely impact our effective tax rate. BEPS did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in 2024 and is not expected to have a material impact in 2025. Although there is uncertainty about the United States' continued involvement in these OECD initiatives, the efforts by the OECD and a number of other countries where we operate has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional mandatory disclosures, which will likely cause additional scrutiny of the Company's tax positions and potentially increased tax assessments.\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties.\nThe success of our supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, vendors, co-manufacturers, third-party outsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our critical business partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as financial issues, operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, pandemics or other public health issues, or other systemic issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations, such as exposing us to cybersecurity-related compromises, or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing challenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue.\nOur operations have been and may in the future be adversely impacted as a result of public health crises, pandemics, and epidemics.\nPublic health crises, pandemics and epidemics, have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any outbreaks of new public health crises, pandemics, and epidemics and the related government responses may adversely affect our operations, facilities, health of our employees and consumers, as well as general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base. The extent to which we may be impacted by future outbreaks of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics is difficult to predict and will depend on many factors outside of our control. These factors include the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of any pandemic, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. To the extent any public health crisis, pandemic or epidemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition, and share price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A.\nWe are dependent on our executive management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends on our executive management team and other key personnel with skills upon which our business depends, and our ability to effectively identify, attract, retain, and motivate high quality employees, and replace those who retire or resign. We believe that we have an experienced and highly qualified executive management team, and the loss of service of any one or more of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and our future profitability. Failure to retain and motivate our executive management team and to hire, retain, and develop other important personnel, which may be particularly challenging given the current dynamics in certain labor markets in which we operate, could generally impact other levels of our management and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategies and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, Swiss law prohibits certain executive compensation practices, including \nsign-on bonuses and severance and takeover incentive or similar payments for our executive management team (except for pay during a notice period of up to 12 months), which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.\nRisks Relating to the Registered Shares\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law, and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us and our directors and officers.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and our articles of association (the \"Articles of Association\"). The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions, including the United States and Bermuda, our domicile prior to the Redomestication. Swiss law reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. See Exhibit 4.2 for an overview of certain material terms and provisions of the Company’s registered shares.\nSeveral of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process on those persons in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is uncertain whether Swiss courts would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against Bunge Global or other persons that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or original actions brought against Bunge Global or other persons predicated upon the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"). The enforceability in Switzerland of a foreign judgment rendered against Bunge Global or such other persons is subject to the limitations set forth in such international treaties by which Switzerland is bound and the Swiss Federal Private International Law Act. In particular, and without limitation to the foregoing, a judgment rendered by a foreign court may only be enforced in Switzerland if: \n•such foreign court had jurisdiction, \n•such judgment has become final and non-appealable, \n•the court procedures leading to such judgment followed the principles of due process of law, including proper service of process, and \n•such judgment does not violate Swiss law principles of public policy.\nIn addition, enforceability of a judgment by a non-Swiss court in Switzerland may be limited if Bunge Global can demonstrate that it or such other persons were not effectively served with process. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland's public policy. \nAs a Swiss corporation, our flexibility will be limited with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nSwiss law regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely available equity is available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our stated share capital, unless our shareholders authorize (including through the capital band) the Board to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation in order to effect a capital reduction.\nSwiss law allows Bunge Global’s shareholders to authorize the Board to issue shares without additional shareholder approval, but this authorization is limited to (i) 50% of Bunge Global’s stated share capital (among other things, the issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition or to raise new equity capital, subject to compliance with shareholders' preemptive rights, unless withdrawn for the reasons specified in the Articles of Association) (the \"capital band\") and (ii) an additional 20% of Bunge Global’s stated share capital for the issuance of shares in connection with convertible or similar financial instruments and our equity incentive plans (the \"conditional share capital\"). The Board's authority to issue shares based on the capital band must be renewed by the shareholders every five years. The Articles of Association provides for a capital band authorizing the Board to issue up to 86,861,666 new shares or to cancel or reduce the par value of up to 26,138,964 shares (including to cancel shares repurchased under Bunge Global's share repurchase program) up until October 19, 2028. After October 19, 2028, the capital band will only be available to the Board for issuance or cancellation of registered shares if a renewed authorization is approved by shareholders. \nAdditionally, Swiss law grants existing shareholders preemptive rights to subscribe for newly issued shares and advance subscription rights to subscribe for convertible and similar financial instruments. Preemptive rights and advance subscription \nrights may be limited or withdrawn only for valid reasons. In connection with share issuances based on the capital band and the conditional share capital, the preemptive rights and the advance subscription rights may only be limited or withdrawn for the reasons specified in the Article of Association. \nSwiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares. Further, Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions, including the declaration and approval of dividends under certain circumstances. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility to swiftly implement certain initiatives or strategies, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.\nFurther, we are required, from time to time, to evaluate the carrying amount of our investments in affiliates, as presented on our Swiss standalone balance sheet. If we determine that the carrying amount of any such investment exceeds its fair value, we may conclude that such investment is impaired. Any recognized loss associated with such a non-cash impairment could result in our net assets no longer covering our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves. Under Swiss law, if our net assets cover less than 50% of our statutory share capital and the non-distributable part of the statutory capital and profit reserves, the Board must take appropriate measures or, to the extent such measures fall within the competence of the general meeting of shareholders, convene a general meeting of shareholders for the approval of suitable measures for reorganization of the company, to remedy such a capital loss. Appropriate measures depend on the relevant circumstances and the magnitude of the recognized loss and may include seeking shareholder approval for offsetting the aggregate loss, or a portion thereof, with our statutory capital reserves, including qualifying capital contribution reserves otherwise available for distributions to shareholders, or raising new equity. Depending on the circumstances, we may also need to use qualifying capital contribution reserves available for distributions in order to reduce our accumulated net loss and such use might reduce our ability to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.\nWe may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.\nUnder current Swiss law, distributions made out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or made in the form of a par value reduction are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, there can be no assurances that the Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that shareholders will approve a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves recognized by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration or a reduction in par value for distributions. Further, over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves available for Bunge Global may be limited. If Bunge Global is unable to make a distribution out of qualifying capital contribution reserves or through a reduction in par value, then any dividend distributions paid by Bunge Global will generally be subject to a Swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the \"U.S.-Swiss Treaty,\" may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). Switzerland currently has concluded more than 70 tax treaties with the same treatment regarding the refund of Swiss withholding taxes. \nUnder current Swiss law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value plus qualifying capital contributions reserves and the repurchase price. Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying contribution reserves available for Bunge Global may be limited. Bunge Global may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, whereby Swiss institutional investors purchase Bunge Global shares from you and then sell the shares to Bunge Global and apply for a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if Bunge Global is unable to use this process successfully, Bunge Global may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes. \nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our Articles of Association that may discourage a change of control.\nOur Articles of Association have provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect. Our Articles of Association has a capital band provision, according to which the Board is authorized, at any time until October 19, 2028, to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of the existing shareholders in various circumstances. Under our capital band, the Board has authority to issue up to 86,861,666 new shares or to cancel or reduce the par value of up to 26,138,964 shares until October 19, 2028.\nThis provision, as well as any additional anti-takeover measures our Board could adopt in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Viterra Acquisition\nAs a result of the Acquisition, our shareholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.\nOur shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Board and on other matters affecting us. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, each of our shareholders will become a shareholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than each such shareholder’s percentage ownership of Bunge immediately prior to the Acquisition. Upon completion of the transaction, the Viterra Shareholder Group are expected to own approximately 30% of the combined Bunge company on a fully diluted basis, before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023. Accordingly, our current shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Bunge.\nOur and Viterra’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Acquisition.\nParties with which we or Viterra do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Viterra or the combined business. Our and Viterra’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as clients, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, Viterra or the combined business. It is possible that these disruptions will continue following the closing of the Acquisition. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including a material and adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion or termination of the Acquisition.\nUntil the completion or termination of the Acquisition, we and Viterra are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, Viterra and/or our respective shareholders.\nFrom and after the date of the Business Combination Agreement and prior to completion of the Acquisition, the Business Combination Agreement restricts us and Viterra from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires that the business of each company and its respective subsidiaries be conducted independently in the ordinary course in all material respects. These restrictions may prevent us or Viterra from taking actions that would be beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the Acquisition could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation or termination of the Acquisition.\nThird parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or Viterra.\nWe and Viterra each have contracts with customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, licensors, joint venture partners, and other business partners which may require us or Viterra, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the Acquisition. If these consents cannot be obtained, the counterparties to these contracts and other third parties with which we and/or Viterra currently have relationships may have the ability to terminate, reduce the scope of or otherwise materially adversely alter their relationships with either or both parties in anticipation of the Acquisition, or with the combined company following the Acquisition. The pursuit of such rights may result in Bunge or the combined company suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities in connection with a breach of such agreements and losing rights that are material to its business. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The adverse effect of such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion or termination of the Acquisition.\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Acquisition.\nThe Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Business Combination Agreement, including, (i) all required consents, clearances, authorizations and approvals pursuant to antitrust laws, foreign investments laws, and other laws, as applicable, having been obtained, (ii) no law, order, injunction or decree will be in effect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the Acquisition, and (iii) the increase in our share capital to effect the issuance of registered shares to Viterra shareholders and the related amendments to our governing documents in connection therewith has been registered with the competent cantonal commercial register in Switzerland. Although we and Viterra have agreed in the Business Combination Agreement to use our reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations, as the case may be, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals. Any delay in completing the Acquisition could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected time frame. \nThe Acquisition could be terminated.\nAlthough we expect the Acquisition to close in the coming months, either we or Viterra may terminate the Business Combination Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Acquisition is not consummated by an agreed upon termination date set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. The termination date was extended twice pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement due to failure to obtain certain regulatory clearances. The members of the Viterra Shareholder Group, acting collectively, on the one hand, and Bunge, on the other hand, have further extended the termination date to March 13, 2025 and may extend the termination date again to June 13, 2025, due to failure to obtain these regulatory clearances. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in connection with certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain antitrust and competition clearances that are conditions to closing, we would be obligated to pay to Viterra a fee of $400 million in the aggregate. \nFailure to complete the Acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Acquisition, we could be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n•We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and from our clients, staff and vendors;\n•We may be required to pay Viterra or the Viterra Shareholder Group, as applicable, a fee of up to approximately $400 million if the Acquisition is not consummated;\n•We will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs relating to the Acquisition, whether or not the Acquisition is completed;\n•The Business Combination Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Acquisition; and\n•Matters relating to the Acquisition (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nWe and Viterra may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Acquisition.\nUncertainty about whether the Acquisition will close and, if it closes, the effect of the Acquisition will have on our employees and Viterra’s employees may have an adverse effect on each of us and Viterra separately and consequently the combined business, following the closing. This uncertainty may impair our and Viterra’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Acquisition is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Acquisition, as our employees and Viterra’s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. Furthermore, if our key employees or Viterra’s key employees depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become team members of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may be adversely affected.\nShareholder lawsuits relating to the Acquisition have been, and may in the future be filed against us, which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed.\nShareholder lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into transactions like the Acquisition. Such a shareholder lawsuit was filed against us in connection with the Acquisition, which subsequently has been dismissed, but there is no assurance that there will not be additional shareholder lawsuits brought against us in connection with the Acquisition. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Acquisition, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Acquisition from being completed.\nThe incurrence of debt to fund the pending acquisition of Viterra may impact our financial position and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $6.2 billion of total debt. Our total debt is expected to increase to $13 billion upon completion of the Acquisition and the related financing transactions. In connection with the execution of the \nBusiness Combination Agreement, we secured a total of $8.0 billion in acquisition debt financing (\"Acquisition Financing\"). On September 17, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (collectively, the \"September 2024 Senior Notes\") of Bunge Limited Finance Corp. (\"BLFC\"), an indirect, 100%-owned subsidiary of Bunge, which are guaranteed by Bunge, to, among other things, fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Acquisition and to repay a portion of certain Viterra debt that we expect to assume in connection with the Acquisition, including, in each case, related fees and expenses, and, with any remaining amounts, for general corporate purposes. The indenture governing the notes requires BLFC to redeem the notes if the consummation of the Acquisition does not occur on or before certain dates or if the Acquisition is terminated at 101% principal amount of the notes. As a result of the September 2024 Senior Notes issuance, and in accordance with its terms, the Acquisition Financing commitment was reduced by $2.0 billion to $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. \nIn addition, certain notes of Viterra totaling approximately $3.3 billion will remain outstanding following the closing of the Acquisition and we will take the required actions in order to have such notes be pari passu with existing senior unsecured indebtedness of Bunge. In the third quarter of 2024, BLFC commenced offers (the \"US Exchange Offers\") to exchange all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Viterra Finance B.V. (\"VFBV\") and guaranteed by Viterra and Viterra B.V., for up to $1.95 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by BLFC and guaranteed by Bunge. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, Viterra commenced a consent solicitation (the \"European Consent Solicitation\") to amend the indenture governing VFBV's outstanding 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 0.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and outstanding 700 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 1.000% senior unsecured notes due 2028 to, among other things, substitute the issuer and guarantors of such notes with Bunge Finance Europe B.V. (\"BFE\"), a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Bunge, as issuer, and Bunge as guarantor. The US Exchange Offers and European Consent Solicitation are conditioned upon, among other things, the consummation of the Acquisition. This Annual Report is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or purchase, or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase, or the solicitation of any vote of approval or the solicitation of tenders or consents with respect to any security. No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. \nInterest rate fluctuations may increase our overall cost of capital. In addition, we anticipate that as a result of the debt we expect to incur and have already incurred to finance the Acquisition, credit rating agencies will review our credit ratings. As part of their ratings review and subsequent credit opinions related to the Acquisition, Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\"), Moody's and Fitch have taken the following actions: \n•S&P upgraded our long-term debt credit rating to BBB+ on June 13, 2023 and further placed the outlook on CreditWatch Positive for an upgrade to A- on September 9, 2024.\n•S&P also assigned a preliminary A- issue-level rating to the September 2024 Senior Notes on September 10, 2024;\n• Moody’s upgraded our long-term debt credit rating to Baa1 on August 1, 2024 with stable outlook; and\n• Fitch upgraded our long-term debt credit rating to BBB+ on September 5, 2024 with stable outlook. \nHowever, there is no assurance that any positive outlook on our ratings will materialize. Any potential future negative change in our credit ratings may make it more expensive for us to raise long-term financing or additional capital, and may negatively impact the price of registered shares, increase our overall cost of capital, and have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the Acquisition, regardless of whether the Acquisition is completed.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Acquisition. These expenses include, but are not limited to, fees related to arranging debt financing, financial advisory and opinion fees and expenses, legal fees, accounting fees and expenses, certain employee expenses, consulting fees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses will be payable by us regardless of whether the Acquisition is completed.\nIf our due diligence investigation of Viterra was inadequate or if risks related to Viterra’s business materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders’ investment.\nEven though we conducted a customary due diligence investigation of Viterra, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present inside Viterra or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Viterra and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise or if known risks prove to be more significant than expected, the ongoing business of the combined company and our shareholders’ investment may be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Viterra is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of Viterra. The aggregate consideration for the Viterra is set forth in \nthe Business Combination Agreement as a result of negotiations and because these share amounts are fixed, they will not adjust to factor in any change in the value of Viterra before closing. As a result, there is no guarantee that the value of the aggregate consideration in the Acquisition will align with the actual value of the Viterra at closing.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company\nBecause we and Viterra operate similar businesses in similar industries, the risks relating to us and our business are generally the same as the risks relating to the combined company. This section should be read in conjunction with the other risk factors discussed under this Item 1A.\nAfter completion of the Acquisition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of registered shares.\nThe success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Bunge and Viterra. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:\n•Our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Bunge and Viterra;\n•Whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;\n•The incurrence of indebtedness to finance the Acquisition and the need to dedicate a greater amount of cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness; and\n•The assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Viterra.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate and combine the business of Bunge and Viterra within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected, and the value of Bunge shares may be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of our key staff or Viterra’s key staff, the disruption of either or both company’s ongoing businesses, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:\n•challenges and difficulties associated with managing the large, more complex, combined company and coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n•identifying and adopting the best practices of the two organizations to position the combined business for future growth;\n•harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, reporting structure, staff development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes, including compliance by the acquired operations with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the documentation and testing of internal control procedures under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which includes remediating certain deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting of Viterra identified in connection with the audit of its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 that constituted a material weakness and resulted in financial statement restatements;\n•rebranding operations and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n•consolidating and integrating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure, including technologies, systems, and services;\n•attracting, motivating, and retaining talent, including due to issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security, or a desire not to become team members of the combined business;\n•diversion of management's attention or resources away from our operations or growth initiatives to integration;\n•maintaining existing business relationships, building new relationships, and avoiding delays in entering into new relationships with prospective business partners; and\n•identifying and eliminating redundant assets and expenses and consolidating locations of us and Viterra that are currently in close proximity to each other.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur significant integration-related costs in connection with the Acquisition and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated synergies of the combined company.\nWe have incurred, and will, following the completion of the Acquisition, continue to incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and staff-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred \nin the Acquisition and the integration of Viterra into our business. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, that may allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all, and we may incur difficulties and delays in integrating Viterra’s business following completion of the Acquisition or fully realizing the anticipated cost synergies and other benefits expected from the Acquisition.\nThe market price for registered shares of the combined company following the completion of the Acquisition may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of the registered shares.\nThe results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting our results of operations and those currently or historically affecting the results of operations of Viterra. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those that currently affect or have historically affected either Bunge or Viterra.\nCertain Sellers will be able to exercise influence over the composition of the Board, matters subject to shareholder approval and/or our operations.\nUpon the completion of the Acquisition, the number of registered shares expected to be issued to Glencore, CPP Investments and BCI will represent approximately 15%, 12% and 3% of our outstanding registered shares, or in the aggregate approximately 30% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis before giving effect to any share repurchases by Bunge occurring after June 13, 2023. As further discussed in “Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—(f) Purchases of Equity Securities by Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers,” Bunge has a share repurchase program with a total authorization since inception of $2.7 billion, with an aggregate purchase authorization of approximately $800 million remaining for repurchase as of December 31, 2024. Bunge has repurchased, and may continue to repurchase its registered shares from time to time under the share repurchase program, which may occur before the completion of the Acquisition. Repurchases under the program may increase the Viterra Shareholder Group’s aggregate ownership percentage in the combined company up to approximately 35% if all remaining registered shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program are repurchased.\nSubject to and effective upon the completion of the pending Acquisition, Bunge and each of Glencore and CPP Investments are expected to execute the Shareholder Agreements. Each Shareholder’s Agreement is expected to provide each of Glencore and CPP Investments the right to designate (a) two persons to be nominated for election to the Board, as long as each maintains beneficial ownership of at least 10% of the registered shares; and (b) one person to be nominated for election to the Board, as long as each maintains beneficial ownership of at least 5% of the registered shares. In contemplation of these Shareholder Agreements, each of Glencore and CCP Investments has nominated candidates to serve as directors on the Board subject to and contingent upon the Acquisition closing. These director nominees were included in the Company's 2024 definitive proxy statement, and the Company's shareholders approved these director nominees to serve on the Board following the Acquisition. As a result, following the completion of the Acquisition, Glencore and CPP Investments will be able to influence the composition of the Board and thus, potentially, the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as statutory mergers or the issuance of new shares where preemptive rights of shareholders are to be withdrawn, which require the affirmative vote of a majority of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at the general meeting of shareholders. This concentration of investment and voting power, in addition to our current concentration of investment and voting power among certain large shareholders, could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to Bunge and its shareholders, which could adversely affect the market price of registered shares.",
