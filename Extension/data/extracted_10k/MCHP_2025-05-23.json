To address these requirements, manufacturers often use integrated circuit-based embedded control systems that enable them to: \n•differentiate their products\n•replace less efficient electromechanical control devices\n•reduce the number of components in their system\n•add product functionality\n•reduce the system level energy consumption\n•make systems safer to operate\n•reduce the consumption of natural resources\n•add security to their products\n•decrease time to market for their products\n•significantly reduce product cost\nEmbedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide, including:\n•actuators\n•applications requiring touch buttons, touch screens and graphical user interfaces\n•automotive access control\n•automotive comfort, safety, information and entertainment applications\n•avionics\n•communication infrastructure systems\n•consumer electronics\n•data center solutions\n•defense and military hardware\n•electric vehicles\n•handheld tools\n•home and building automation\n•industrial automation\n•large and small home appliances\n•medical devices\n•motor controls\n•portable computers and accessories\n•power supplies\n•residential and commercial security systems\n•robotics\n•routers and video surveillance systems\n•satellites\n•smart home, IoT and AI/ML edge devices\n•smart meters and energy monitoring\n•storage and server systems \n•touch control\n•wireless communication\nEmbedded control systems typically incorporate a mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor or FPGA as the principal active, and sometimes sole, component.  A mixed-signal microcontroller is a self-contained computer-on-a-chip consisting of a central processing unit, often with on-board non-volatile program memory for program storage, random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital input/output peripheral capabilities.  In addition to the mixed-signal microcontroller, a complete embedded control system often incorporates application-specific software, various analog, mixed-signal, timing, connectivity, security and non-volatile memory components such as EEPROMs and Flash memory.\n\nMixed-signal microcontrollers are primarily available in 8-bit through 32-bit architectures. In July 2024, we entered the 64-bit mixed-signal microprocessor market furthering our expansion beyond 32-bit architecture. 8-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers remain very cost-effective and easy to use for a wide range of high-volume embedded control applications and, as a result, continue to represent a significant portion of the overall mixed-signal microcontroller market.  16-bit and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality, and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications. FPGAs are programmable integrated circuits that are used to implement complex logic functions and can be re-programmed at any time, allowing for multiple implementations and revisions during or after the customer system is manufactured. Some versions of FPGAs also include a mixed-signal microcontroller or microprocessor core to provide additional system on chip functionality to compute intensive tasks. Microprocessors integrate 32-bit (or above) central processing units (CPUs) with various high performance peripherals, such as communications and graphics, and execute code from external memory, typically dynamic random access memory. 64-bit microprocessors offer even greater computational power and are often utilized in applications requiring advanced processing capabilities, such as data-intensive tasks and sophisticated system operations such as Linux. \nOur Products\nOur strategic focus is on providing cost-effective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size, high performance, extreme low power usage, wide voltage range operation, mixed-signal integration, and ease of development, thus enabling timely and cost-effective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products.\nMixed-signal Microcontrollers\nWe offer a broad family of proprietary general purpose mixed-signal microcontroller products, with significant analog and mixed-signal functionality incorporated within them, which are marketed under multiple brand names.  We believe that our mixed-signal microcontroller product families provide leading function and performance characteristics in the worldwide market. We target the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontroller and 32-bit embedded mixed-signal microprocessor markets. In July 2024, we entered the 64-bit mixed-signal microprocessor market. We also offer specialized mixed-signal microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications. \n\nWe leverage our circuit design, process technologies, development tools, applications knowledge, and manufacturing experiences to enable our customers to implement various embedded control functions in their end systems with our mixed-signal microcontrollers.\n\nAnalog\n\nOur analog product line consists of several families including power management, linear, mixed-signal, high voltage, thermal management, discrete diodes and MOSFETS, RF, drivers, safety, security, timing, USB, ethernet, wireless and other interface products.  \n\nWe market and sell our analog product line into our mixed-signal microcontroller, microprocessor and FPGA customer base, and to customers who use mixed-signal microcontrollers and FPGA products from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and memory products customer base.\n\nOther\nOur other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and products for aerospace applications.\nOur portfolio of non-volatile FPGAs are recognized for their low power, high security and extended reliability. We market and sell our FPGA products and related solutions into a broad range of applications within the industrial, automotive, defense, aviation, space and communications markets. \nOur technology licensing business generates license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our SuperFlash® embedded flash and other technologies. We also generate fees for engineering services related to these technologies. We license our Non-Volatile Memory technologies to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced mixed-signal microcontroller products, gate array, RF, analog and neuromorphic compute products that require embedded non-volatile memory.\nOur memory products consist of EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories, Serial SRAM memories and EERAMs. Serial EEPROMs, Serial Flash memories, Serial SRAMs and EERAMs have a very low I/O pin requirement, permitting production of very small footprint devices. We sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market, complementing our mixed-signal microcontroller offerings.\nDevelopment Tools\n\nWe offer a comprehensive set of low-cost and easy-to-learn application development tools.  These tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products for specific applications and, we believe, they are an important factor for facilitating design wins.\n\nOur family of development tools for our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA and microprocessor products range from entry-level systems, which include an assembler or a compiler and programmer or in-circuit debugging hardware, to fully configured systems that provide in-circuit emulation capability.  We also offer a complete suite of compilers, software code configurators and simulators. Customers moving from entry-level designs to those requiring real-time emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future mixed-signal microcontroller devices in our portfolio.\nMany independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our mixed-signal microcontroller and microprocessor product architectures, including an extensive amount of third-party tool suppliers whose products support our mixed-signal microcontroller architectures.\n\nWe believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from Microchip as well as from third-party development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products.  These development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of application-specific products from our standard mixed-signal microcontrollers.\nManufacturing\n\nOur manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test.  The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (such as \nstatistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles.  This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin. We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties. We comply with several quality systems, including: ISO9001 (2015 version), IATF16949 (2016 version), AS9100 (2016 version), and TL9000.\nRefer to \"Item 2. Properties\" for further information regarding the location and principal operations of our manufacturing facilities.\nWafer Fabrication\n\n On March 3, 2025, we announced the closure of our Fab 2 manufacturing operations. The Fab 2 closure was completed in May 2025 and the Fab 2 facility and equipment are currently available for sale. With our inventory levels being high and having ample capacity in place, we announced our decision to close Fab 2, which we expect will generate annual cash savings of approximately $90 million. All of the process technologies will be transferred from Fab 2 to Fab 4 and Fab 5 factories and many such technologies are already running in Fab 4 and Fab 5, both of which have ample clean room space for expansion. \n\nFab 4, located in Gresham, Oregon, currently produces 8-inch wafers using predominantly 0.13 microns to 0.5 microns manufacturing processes.  While select investments are still being made, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused our multi-year $800 million expansion and capital equipment investment plan at Fab 4 through fiscal 2026. We plan to resume our expansion efforts to increase Fab 4's capacity as the business outlook improves. \nFab 5, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, currently manufactures discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products on 6-inch wafers. In February 2023, we announced our plan to invest $880 million over the next several years to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon production capacity, including the production of 8-inch wafers, at our Fab 5 facility. While select investments are still being made to reorganize our manufacturing capacity, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we paused our expansion activity through fiscal 2026. We plan to resume our expansion efforts as the business outlook improves.\nWe believe the closure of Fab 2 and the combined capacity of Fab 4 and Fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand for internally fabricated products with incremental capital expenditures. Consistent with the macroeconomic environment during fiscal 2025, our capacity expansion activity at Fab 4 and Fab 5 remained paused and we have reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2026.\nIn addition to the Fab 2 closure, which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we reduced headcount at Fab 4, Fab 5 and our backend manufacturing facility in the Philippines. We expect approximately $90 million in annual savings related to the closure of Fab 2, plus approximately $25 million in annual savings from the temporarily reduced compensation costs in Fab 4 and Fab 5. \nAs a result of our prior acquisition activity, we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities, which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture. We currently plan to continue to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational and accommodate areas of growing demand.\nWe continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.  We believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive.\nIn fiscal 2025, approximately 36% of our sales came from products produced at our own wafer fabrication facilities that are located in the U.S. There are benefits to having our own U.S. wafer fabrication facilities such as increased IP protection and security, increased supply chain resilience and the ability to manage production costs. We augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to third-party wafer foundries, including all of our 300mm wafer requirements and some of our 200mm and 150mm specialty process technologies. In fiscal 2025, approximately 64% of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. Diversifying our wafer production geographically can help prevent disruptions that may be caused by geopolitical tensions, tariffs or natural disasters.\nAssembly and Test \n\nWe perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world. During fiscal 2025, we increased capabilities at our Thailand and Philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements, upgrading existing equipment, and adding equipment. During fiscal 2025, approximately 67% of both our assembly requirements and our test requirements were performed in internal facilities. We use third-party assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements. We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.\nGeneral Matters Impacting Our Manufacturing Operations\n\nDue to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing, consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results.  Our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities.  Our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control, extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment.  Maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results.  The manufacture of integrated circuits, particularly non-volatile, erasable complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) memory and logic devices, such as those that we produce, are complex processes.  These processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors, including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.  Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels.\nHistorically, we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules.  In order to respond to such requirements, we have historically maintained a significant work-in-process and finished goods inventory. Refer to Note 3 for a summary of our long-lived assets, consisting of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, by geography.\n\nWe have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors that provide our various materials and service needs. We generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services, but, in some cases, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers.\nSales and Distribution\n\nGeneral\n\nWe market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors to approximately 109,000 unique customers.\n\nOur direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets.  We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.  Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team.  ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts.\n\nOur licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees.\n\nFor information regarding our revenue, results of operations, and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years, refer to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nDistribution\n\nOur distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers.  We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  We believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, we derived 45% of our net sales through distributors compared to 55% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us. In fiscal 2024, we derived 47% of our net sales through distributors compared to 53% of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% and 12% of our net sales, in fiscal 2025 and in fiscal 2024, respectively, no distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.\n\nGenerally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders otherwise designated as non-cancellable. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.\n Competition\n\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has historically been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change.  We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products.  We also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied, cloned, pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as China and Taiwan.  We are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis.\nWe currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products, including the following product characteristics: \n•performance\n•analog, digital and mixed-signal functionality and level of functional integration\n•field programmability\n•memory density\n•low power consumption\n•extended voltage ranges\n•reliability\n•security and functional safety\n•packaging alternatives\n•comprehensive suite of development tools\nWe believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include: \n•our broad product portfolio offers a Total System Solutions through a combination of hardware, software and services \n•ease of use\n•functionality of application development systems\n•hardware, software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility \n•dependable delivery, quality and availability\n•technical and innovative service and support\n•time to market\n•total solution cost\n•reference design\nWe believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors, but if we are unable to compete successfully in the future, our business could be harmed.\nPatents, Licenses and Trademarks\n\nWe maintain a portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents, expiring on various dates from 2025 through 2044.  We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  We do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our semiconductor business.  While our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products.  As with any operating company, the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets, including our pending and existing patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage.  Moreover, pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws. Further, the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\n\nWe have also entered into certain in-bound and outbound intellectual property licenses and cross-licenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes.  As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we and our customers from time to time receive, and may continue to receive, demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights.  We diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate.  In most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, however, we cannot be certain that this would be the case, or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided. Licensees of our technology may become unable to pay, and have in the past and are currently disputing their obligations to pay us royalties or fees. Litigation, arbitration or other proceedings, which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management, has been and is expected to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others.  The failure to obtain necessary licenses, the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings, or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business.\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\nWe must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our products and manufacturing processes.  Our waste disposal programs in our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations. However, any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could result in an increase in capital expenditures such as acquiring costly equipment or other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities.\n\nIncreasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations.  While we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations, technological changes, or weather, our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of, hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur Employees \nWe invest in our highly-skilled global workforce of approximately 19,400 people in accordance with our Guiding Value: employees are our greatest strength. We believe that our culture, values, and organizational development and training programs provide a work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers.\nCulture and Core Values\nBefore Microchip went public in 1993, Microchip created a cultural framework to unite its employees through shared workplace values, and to guide employees’ strategies, decisions, actions and job performance. Our culture is centered on a values-based, highly-empowered, continuous-improvement oriented approach. This corporate culture strengthens our business, and enables us to fulfill our purpose. Our focus on communication aims to provide transparency among leadership, to promote trust among employees, and is a critical part of Microchip’s culture. \nOur culture is important to our employees, and is a key reason why we have a significant number of employees with long tenure with Microchip that have grown from individual contributors in the early stages of their careers into senior leadership positions today. This long tenure among our employee-base results in deep relationships and trust being built among colleagues, retention of our knowledge base, and continuation of our culture. More information on our Guiding Values can be found at www.microchip.com/en-us/about/investors/investor-information/mission-statement.\nWe promote employee adoption of our culture through a number of methods including training, mentorship, values-based performance reviews, company-wide quarterly meetings, town hall meetings with the President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive team members, and an open-door policy of communication where employees are encouraged to interact directly with management. To assess and improve employee engagement, we conduct our annual employee engagement survey, which is administered in a manner that allows employees to respond confidentially. The survey solicits feedback on a variety of factors, including engagement, culture, leadership, continuous improvement, collaboration, work environment, and ethics. \nTraining and Development \nMicrochip’s culture focuses on continuous improvement. We provide training on our culture, management skills, communication, technical skills, and personal improvement. Microchip also has a leadership program that provides for the growth and development of its future leaders. This program helps us develop leaders that serve as role models of Microchip culture, and support empowerment and open communication. \nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer coaching, and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences. We create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and regularly upgrade our offerings to help ensure that our employees are exposed to current content. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.\nCompensation Programs\nWe strive to provide competitive pay and benefits, that help meet the varying needs of our employees and encourage employees to be shareholders in Microchip through our various equity incentive plans. Our total compensation package includes base pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare and retirement plans, employee stock purchase plans, paid time off and family leave. Benefit programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., and statutory pension programs outside the U.S. Microchip has multiple equity programs in place including restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchase plans that align employee interests with those of our shareholders.\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of April 30, 2025:\n\nName                                         Age   Position                                                                \nSteve Sanghi                                  69   Executive Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President     \nRichard J.

and\n•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry\nOur operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability. \nOur operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the factors that may affect our operating results include:\n•general economic, industry, public health or political conditions in the U.S. or internationally, including uncertain economic conditions in U.S., China and Europe, changes in tariffs, interest rates, persistent inflation or instability in the banking sector;\n•trade restrictions and increase in tariffs, including those on business in China, or focused on specific companies;\n•the level of order cancellations or push-outs due to uncertain economic conditions or other factors;\n•levels of inventories held by our customers and the customers of our distributors;\n•the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory;\n•the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter, including the impact of product lead times;\n•disruptions in our business, our supply chain or our customers' businesses due to public health concerns (including viral outbreaks and pandemics), cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war (including military conflict in the Middle East and Russia's invasion of Ukraine), worldwide oil prices and supply, fires, natural disasters or disruptions in the transportation system;\n•changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers, and market fluctuations in the industries into which such products are sold;\n•availability of raw materials including rare earth minerals, supplies and equipment due to supply chain constraints, disruptions in transportation systems, trade restrictions, or other factors;\n•constrained availability from other electronic suppliers or disruptions in transit systems impacting our customers' ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;\n•our ability to continue to increase our factory capacity as needed to respond to changes in customer demand;\n•our ability to secure sufficient wafer foundry, assembly and testing capacity;\n•increased costs and availability of raw materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and/or subcontracted services for wafers, assembly and test;\n•changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n•changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;\n•changes in tax regulations in countries in which we do business; \n•new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; \n•risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n•competitive developments including pricing pressures;\n•unauthorized copying of our products resulting in pricing pressure and loss of sales;\n•our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce manufacturing costs;\n•the level of sell-through of our products through distribution or resale;\n•our ability to realize the expected benefits of our past or future acquisitions;\n•fluctuations in our mix of product sales;\n•announcements of other significant acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n•costs and outcomes of any current or future tax audits or any litigation, investigation or claims involving intellectual property, our acquisitions, customers or other issues; and\n•property damage or other losses, whether or not covered by insurance.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance. In future periods, our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. Uncertain global economic and public health conditions have caused and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparisons between periods less meaningful.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by the financial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors, or suppliers. \nWe regularly review the financial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors and suppliers. Any downturn in global or regional economic conditions, as a result of tariffs, high interest rates, high inflation, instability in the banking sector, the enactment of broad sanctions or tariffs by the U.S. or other countries, public health concerns, industry work stoppages, transit stoppages or other factors, may adversely impact their financial viability. The financial decline of a \nlarge licensee, customer, reseller or distributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our inability to collect our accounts receivable balances, higher allowances for credit losses, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Also, these parties may not comply with their contractual commitments, or may interpret them differently than we do, which could lead to termination of their performance with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, has business leverage, or favorable contractual terms, then our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's cessation of performance may be limited by their liquidity, the applicable laws, or their willingness to negotiate a resolution. In the event of such default or cessation of performance, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have various arrangements with financial institutions for our cash deposits, and other banking activities, that subject us to risk if such institutions were to experience financial or regulatory difficulties. As a result, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and cash equivalents due to failures of financial institutions or other related parties.\nWe may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials, components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers' needs, increase prices, are impacted by increases in tariffs, or such raw materials, components or equipment become restricted or unavailable. \nOur manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources for these supplies, but there may be a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting our standards.  We have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time to fill our orders, that they cannot fill certain orders, that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or parts, or that they are increasing prices. In particular, in fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022, we experienced increased prices at certain suppliers for certain materials required for production purposes. However, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, the pricing environment stabilized compared to the two prior fiscal years. An interruption of any materials or equipment sources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment, could harm our business. The supplies necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors increases, or due to supply chain disruptions, transit disruptions, trade restrictions or political instability. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. Also, the reduced availability of necessary labor, the application of sanctions, trade restrictions or tariffs by the U.S. or other countries or the impact of public health concerns, may adversely impact the industry supply chain. The U.S. has imposed additional tariffs on imports, and certain countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports that have the U.S. as their country of origin. For example, in March and April 2025, the U.S imposed tariffs on imports from China and other countries and foreign governments imposed tariffs on imports from the U.S. It is unclear what tariffs will apply to semiconductors during this time of change. \nAdditional tariffs imposed on components, raw materials, or equipment may increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our operating results in future periods. We may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations. We will attempt to mitigate the impact of those tariffs on our business but may experience an increase in operating costs, impaired sourcing flexibility, and reduced demand for our products, resulting in reduced revenue. \nOur customers may also be adversely affected by the tariffs and other issues described above. The labor, supplies and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, reduced availability of labor, transit disruptions, consolidation in their supply chain, or sanctions, trade restrictions or tariffs or the impact of public health concerns that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs. If our customers are not able to produce their products, then their need for our products will decrease. Such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm our business.\nWe do not, nor have we historically, purchased significant amounts of equipment from Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine. However, the semiconductor industry, and purchasers of semiconductors, use raw materials that are sourced from these regions, such as neon, palladium, cesium, rubidium, and nickel. If we, or our direct or indirect customers, are unable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products, our ability to manufacture products, or demand for our products, may be adversely impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While there has been an adverse impact on the world’s palladium, neon, cesium, and rubidium supply chains, at this time, our supply chains have been able to meet our needs. While sales of our products into Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and to customers that sell into these countries, have been negatively impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at this time, we have not experienced a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. Further, because we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products to customers \nand distributors located in Russia and Belarus.\nAdditionally, certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, transit disruptions, political conditions, or public health issues, may limit our ability to obtain materials or equipment. Although rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. In April 2025, China imposed export restrictions on certain rare earth minerals. If China were to further restrict or stop exporting these materials or pressure other countries to do so, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China or other countries.\nWe are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors, as are our SuperFlash and other licensees. \nWe rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Specifically, during fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, approximately 64% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries. We also use several contractors for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products. Specifically, during fiscal 2025, approximately 33% of our assembly requirements and 33% of our test requirements were performed by third-party contractors compared to approximately 41% of our assembly requirements and 29% of our test requirements during fiscal 2024. Due to the amount of inventory of our products that we are holding, we have recently taken actions to decrease our capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication, assembly and test subcontractors. In the event that we need to increase capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication, assembly and test subcontractors in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary allocation of capacity from our wafer foundries and other contractors, or that such capacity will be available on acceptable terms. As our manufacturing subcontractors move to more advanced process technologies over time, we may find that they do not invest in some of the trailing edge process technologies on which a large portion of our products are manufactured. If this occurs, it may limit the amounts of net sales that we can achieve or require us to make significant investments to be able to manufacture these products in our own facilities or at other foundries and assembly and testing contractors. We expect that our reliance on third party contractors may increase over time as our business grows, and any inability to secure necessary external capacity could adversely affect our operating results. Transitioning production of products to new manufacturers may result in delayed product launches, reduced yields, or decreased product performance. If we encounter issues with product quality, insufficient capacity from a third-party manufacturer, or if we discontinue using a particular manufacturer or contractor, we may face challenges in securing an alternative supply for specific products in a timely manner. This could lead to significant delays in product shipments, potentially having an adverse impact on our results of operations. If our reliance on third-party contractors increases over time, our inability to secure necessary external capacity could adversely affect our operating results. \nIn August 2022, the U.S. government passed the CHIPS Act to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and applied for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, we have not concluded negotiations with the U.S. Department of Commerce and there can be no assurance that we will pursue or receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position. If we conclude our CHIPS Act negotiations and receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs.\nOur use of third parties reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business. Our future operating results could suffer if a significant contractor were to experience production difficulties, insufficient capacity, decreased manufacturing, reduced availability of labor, assembly and test yields, or increased costs due to disruptions such as political upheaval, transit disruptions, infrastructure disruption or pandemics. Additionally, our future operating results could suffer if our wafer foundries and other contractors increase the prices of the products and services that they provide to us. If third parties do not timely deliver products or services in accordance with our quality standards, we may be unable to qualify alternate manufacturing sources in a timely manner or on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, these subcontractors could abandon processes that we need, or fail to adopt technologies that we desire to control costs. In such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing costs or a decline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Further, use of subcontractors increases the risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nCertain of our SuperFlash and other technology licensees rely on wafer foundries. If our licensees experienced disruption in supply at such foundries, this would reduce the revenue from our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results.\nWe are highly dependent on foreign sales, suppliers, and operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks. \nSales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales. During fiscal 2025, approximately 75% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 17% in China and 16% in Taiwan. During fiscal 2024, approximately 75% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 18% in China, 12% in Taiwan and 10% in Germany. \nHaving a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Although our sales in the Chinese market were very strong in calendar 2021, competition in China is intense, and China's economic growth slowed in calendar 2022 and through the first half of calendar 2023. In fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2025, economic weakness in the Chinese market adversely impacted our sales volumes in China. As discussed above, the trade relationship between the U.S. and China remains challenging and could worsen in 2025, economic conditions in China remain uncertain, and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods. The increase in tariffs on semiconductors and raw materials that have the U.S. as their country of origin could lower demand for our products in China and other countries. Further, increasing investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned of affiliated entities are intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market, or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies. Weakening of foreign markets, especially in China, has resulted in lower demand for our products, which has adversely impacted our revenue in recent quarters and, if such conditions continue, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. \nWe purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers. Please see the risks related to access to raw materials, components, or equipment on page 16. In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities, and finished goods warehouses near Bangkok, Thailand, which has experienced periods of political instability and severe flooding in the past. There can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations. We have a test facility in Calamba, Philippines. We use foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements. \nOur reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks, including, but not limited to:\n•economic uncertainty in the worldwide markets we serve;\n•trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;\n•political instability, including changes in relations between China and Taiwan which could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries, and subcontractors;\n•social and economic instability due to public health concerns, wars, or other factors;\n•supply chain disruptions or delays;\n•potentially adverse tax consequences;\n•import and export license requirements and restrictions;\n•changes in laws related to taxes, trade, environmental, health and safety, technical standards, climate change, and consumer protection;\n•restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of certain customer payments, and as a results our cash flows;\n•currency fluctuations and foreign exchange regulations;\n•difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n•employment regulations;\n•disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents;\n•disruptions in international transport or delivery;\n•public health conditions (including viral outbreaks such as COVID-19); and\n•difficulties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles.\nIf any of these risks occur or are worse than we anticipate, our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer, we could face an increase in the cost of components, production delays, business interruptions, delays in obtaining export licenses, or denials of such licenses, tariffs and trade restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nWe depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and have limited visibility to product shipments other than orders placed under our LTSAs. \nOur net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog, and orders that are both received and shipped in the same quarter, which we call turns orders. We measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter. Historically, our ability to respond quickly to customer orders has been part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules. Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our visibility on future shipments. Turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times, and in light of current industry conditions, turns orders are once again key to our ability to meet our business objectives. Because turns orders can be difficult to predict, especially in times of economic volatility and changes in tariffs, as experienced in current and recent quarters, where customers may change order levels within the quarter, varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales. The level of turns orders has in the past and may in the future decrease in periods where customers are holding excess inventory of our products. We believe our customers increased their order levels in previous periods of tight supply to help ensure they had sufficient inventory of our products to meet their needs, and then they were unable to sell their products at their forecasted levels which reduced our level of turns orders. As a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries, foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders. If we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets or effectively manage our production based on changes in order forecasts, our revenue and operating results will likely suffer.\nStarting in the first quarter of calendar 2022, we began entering into LTSAs, which offer our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity. LTSAs are not a guarantee of supply; however, they were designed to provide the highest priority for those orders which were under this program, and the capacity priority was on a first-come, first-served basis until the available capacity was booked. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2025, we accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages. However, in the event that we decide to not accommodate a request to push out orders and customers under this program still attempt to cancel or reschedule orders, or refuse shipment, we may be unable to recover damages from customers that default under this program. Additionally, this program has resulted in some customers holding excess inventory of our products and thus decreased their need to place new orders, including turns orders, in recent periods. We built inventories in response to customer demand, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders has resulted in excess inventory, which has resulted in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on our gross margins in recent periods. \nIntense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales or reduced market share. \nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and faces price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. In addition, some governments, such as China, may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors, or to new entrants, and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors, including to try to disrupt the U.S. semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue, product offerings and scale. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•changes in demand in the markets that we serve and the overall rate of growth or contraction of such markets, including but not limited to the automotive, personal computing and consumer electronics markets;\n•our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies or complying with new governmental restrictions regarding implementation of new technologies;\n•the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their applications and the success of such applications; \n•our ability to obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies at acceptable prices;\n•our ability to ramp production and increase capacity as needed, at our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities;\n•the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products;\n•the rate at which the markets that we serve redesign and change their own products;\n•product introductions by our competitors;\n•the number, nature and success of our competitors in a given market;\n•our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights;\n•our ability to address the needs of our customers;\n•our ability to attract and retain talent, including talent with expertise in developing areas such as AI; and\n•general market and economic conditions.\nHistorically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product. The average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGA products, and proprietary products in our analog product line have remained relatively constant over time, while average selling prices of our memory and non-proprietary products in our analog product line have declined over time. The overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period. \nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, modest pricing declines in certain of our proprietary product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. In the past, we have moderated average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. However, we may not be able to do so in the future. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, competitive pricing pressures on our memory and non-proprietary products in our analog product line. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we experienced cost increases which we were able to pass on to our customers. However, in the future, we may be unable to maintain average selling prices due to increased pricing pressure, including as a result of actions taken by foreign governments such as China to favor companies located in their own country through tariffs or other actions, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe, and our competitors, seek to improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor products, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields. \nIntegrated circuit manufacturing processes are complex and sensitive to many factors, including contaminants in the manufacturing environment or materials used, the performance of our personnel and equipment, and other quality issues. As is typical in the industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. Our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels. This could include delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, and penalties for failure to meet shipment deadlines. Our operating results are adversely affected when we operate below normal capacity. In fiscal 2025 and in fiscal 2024, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $173.0 million and $40.7 million, respectively. Additionally, as we are moving production between factories, we may experience lower than anticipated yields during this transition.\nOur operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry. \nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand.  Historically, since a significant portion of our revenue is from international sales and consumer markets, our business generates stronger revenues in the first half and comparatively weaker revenues in the second half of our fiscal year. However, broad fluctuations in our business, changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality. In periods when broad fluctuations, changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur, it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonality on our business. The semiconductor industry has had significant economic downturns (including in recent periods), characterized by diminished product demand and production over-capacity. We have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products, that cannot be quickly replaced, to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments. However, we have experienced substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results and expect, in the future, to experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions. In this regard, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty and customer requests to push-out or cancel backlog increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2024 and adversely impacted our revenue in recent periods. \nConsistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment, and the growth in our inventory, we have paused our factory expansion actions at Fab 4 and Fab 5 and reduced our planned capital investments through fiscal 2026. We are unable to predict the duration or continued impact of the current or any future slowdown on our business. \nOur business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers. \nSales to distributors accounted for approximately 45% of our net sales in fiscal 2025 and approximately 47% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. With the exception of certain orders placed under our LTSAs, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.\nFuture adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies and labor markets or credit markets due to tariffs or other factors could materially impact distributor operations. Any deterioration in the financial condition, or disruption in the operations of our distributors, would likely adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation. In addition, during an industry or economic downturn (including in recent periods), there may be an oversupply and decrease in demand for our products, which could reduce our net sales in a given period, increase order push-outs, increase inventory returns, and cause us to carry elevated levels of inventory. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in fiscal 2024 and in fiscal 2025, we have accommodated requests by customers to push-out certain orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in some cases, to help other customers that are experiencing supply shortages. As a result of the foregoing, we have incurred charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventory, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and sanction laws, or similar laws, by our distributors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. \nOur future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements. The success of our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not limited to:\n•effective new product selection;\n•timely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n•availability of skilled employees;\n•procurement of licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms, including those that may be needed to offer interoperability between our products and third-party products;\n•implementation of appropriate technical standards developed by standard setting organizations;\n•timely filing and protection of intellectual property rights for new product designs;\n•availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use; and\n•market acceptance of our customers' end products.\nBecause our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development. New products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance.  We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, which could adversely impact our future operating results.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies. Semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant R&D expenditures. We and others in the industry have, from time to time, experienced difficulties in transitioning to advanced process technologies and have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries. Our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented.\nBusiness interruptions to our operations or those of our key vendors, licensees or customers could harm our business. \nOperations at any of our facilities, at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors, or at any of our significant vendors, licensees or customers may be disrupted due to public health concerns (including outbreaks such as COVID-19), work stoppages or reduction in available labor, power loss, insufficient water, cyber-attacks, computer network compromises, incidents of terrorism or security risk, tariffs, political instability, governmental actions, telecommunications, transportation or other infrastructure failure, radioactive contamination, adverse changes in climate, or fires, earthquakes, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact \nof some of these events should they occur; however, we cannot be certain that we will avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a business interruption. For example, in August 2024, we determined that an unauthorized party disrupted our use of certain servers and some of our business operations. As a result, certain of our manufacturing facilities were operating at less than normal levels for a period of time, and our ability to fulfill orders was temporarily impacted. While we were able to bring the affected portions of our IT systems back online and restore normal business operations in response to this August 2024 incident without a material impact to our business, we cannot be certain that we would be able to achieve this result in the event of another cyber incident. Separately, in the first three months of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022, COVID-19 related restrictions adversely impacted our manufacturing operations in the U.S., the Philippines and Thailand along with our subcontractors' manufacturing operations in Malaysia, Taiwan and China. Similar challenges arose for our logistics service providers, which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers. Any future pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods if public health issues again becomes severe in one or more of our key markets such as China or in areas where our suppliers or manufacturing operations are located. In the future, local governments could require us to reduce production or cease operations at any of our facilities, and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders.\nAdditionally, operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons. In April and May 2020, we received a greater number of order cancellations and requests by our customers to reschedule deliveries to future dates. Some customers requested order cancellations within our firm order window and claimed applicability of force majeure clauses due to the impact of COVID-19. Likewise, if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology, or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption, our royalty revenue may decline.\nAlso, Thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years. While our facilities in Thailand have continued to operate normally, there can be no assurance that future flooding in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations. If operations at any of our facilities, or our subcontractors' facilities are interrupted, we may not be able to timely shift production to other facilities, and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment.  Business interruptions would likely cause delays in shipments of products to our customers, and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms. This could result in reduced revenues, cancellation of orders, or loss of customers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance, such insurance will likely not compensate us for any losses or damages, and business interruptions could significantly harm our business. For more information on adverse climate change see our risk \"Sustained adverse climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations\" on page 36.\nOur technology licensing business exposes us to various risks. \nOur technology licensing business is based on our SuperFlash and other technologies. The success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop such technologies, to introduce new technologies, and to enforce our license terms. To be successful, any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees, provide satisfactory yield rates, address licensee and customer requirements, and perform competitively. The success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors, including, but not limited to:\n•proper identification of licensee requirements;\n•timely development and introduction of new or enhanced technology;\n•our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our licensed technology, and enforce the terms of our licenses;\n•our ability to limit our liability and indemnification obligations to licensees;\n•availability of development and support services to assist licensees in their design and manufacture of products;\n•availability of foundry licensees with sufficient capacity to support OEM production; and\n•market acceptance of our customers' end products.\nBecause our licensed technologies are complex, there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies. There can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance. Our licensees may experience disruptions in production or reduced production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive. Our technology license agreements generally include a clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages (including legal defense costs) arising from certain intellectual property matters. We could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims. We have a program to audit the royalty payments made by our licensees to help ensure that the payments are in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreements. From time to time, we or our licensees have \ncontested the amount of royalty payments and related claims have resulted and could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management. These issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results.\nSales into governmental projects, and compliance with associated regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \nA significant portion of our sales are from or are derived from government agencies or customers who sell to U.S. government agencies.  Such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels, spending priorities, regulatory and policy changes. Future sales into U.S. government projects are subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including the budgetary process, changes in the timing and spending priorities, the impact of any past or future government shutdowns, contract terminations or renegotiations, future sequestrations, changes in regulations that we must comply with to be eligible to accept new contracts, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification requirements, or the impact of pandemics.  For example, in fiscal 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced suspensions and stop work orders for some of our subcontracts. Additionally, a section in the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 (the NDAA 2023), signed into law on December 23, 2022, with provisions that go into effect in December 2027, prohibits U.S. government agencies from buying semiconductor products or services manufactured by SMIC, YMTC, CXMT and any other entity that the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Commerce determine is owned, controlled, or connected to the government of a foreign country of concern (Prohibited Companies). Some of our products are manufactured at SMIC, and some of our suppliers buy products manufactured at YMTC. If we are unable to alternately source or manufacture certain of our products, or discontinue use of products from Prohibited Companies, if any, when Section 5949 of the NDAA 2023 goes into effect in December 2027, this could adversely impact our sales to U.S. government agencies and their prime customers. Although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business, there can be no assurance as to the future costs or implications of such actions. Sales into government projects are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary, regulatory, tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the U.S. Congress.\nDelays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the U.S. federal government, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. If, in the future, the U.S. government fails to complete its annual budget process, provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations or increase the federal debt limit, another federal government shutdown may occur, during which we may experience further delays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. While we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions, further changes in U.S. government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase compliance obligations (such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification), may adversely impact the contracting environment, our ability to hire and retain employees, and our operating results.\nThe U.S. government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time. Uncertainty in government spending and termination of contracts for government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue from our government related business.  Our contracts with U.S. governmental agencies or prime customers require us to comply with the contract terms, and governmental regulations, particularly for our facilities, systems and personnel that service such customers and related to handling of government-regulated data. To be awarded new contracts, we may be required to meet certain levels of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certifications that we may not meet, or may choose not to meet. We are also required to have facility security clearances to perform classified contracts and to build and sell classified products for U.S. governmental agencies. These clearances are subject to the requirements and regulations including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual that governs the protection of classified information released or disclosed in connection with the performance of classified government contracts. We must also comply with regulations regarding the handling of controlled unclassified information and export-controlled data. Complying with these regulations, including audit requirements, requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training, personnel, information technology and facilities. The increased cost of compliance may adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to comply with these requirements and regulations may result in fines and penalties, or loss of current or future business including our ability to continue as a supplier to U.S. governmental agencies and its contractors and may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time we receive grants from governments, agencies and research organizations, or enter into tax arrangements. If we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants or arrangements, we may not be able to receive or recognize benefits or we may be required to repay benefits, recognize related charges, or could be required to implement \ncertain limitations on our business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position. \nFrom time to time, we have received, and may in the future receive, economic incentive grants, tax benefits, and allowances from national, state and local governments, agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment, production or investment at specific locations. Tax arrangements and subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive, headcount, capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain benefits, and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments. The CHIPS Act and its associated regulations, for example, may contain certain restrictions on grant recipient technology licensing activities and the expansion of certain facilities. Compliance with these restrictions could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. In addition, noncompliance with the conditions of the grants or arrangements could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. We may be unable to obtain future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted. Further, any decrease in amounts received could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures. \nWe have acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. In May 2018, we acquired Microsemi, which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever. Integration of our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may not successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, procedures and policies. We may not realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration. There may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems. It may be difficult to develop, manufacture and market the products of a newly acquired company, or grow the business at the rate we anticipate. There may be increased risk associated with the activities of the acquired company such as regulatory violations related to their use of AI in their operations, technology development or product offerings or cyber security risks. Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. We may suffer loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies. We have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees, stockholders of Microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction. In particular, in connection with our Microsemi and Atmel acquisitions, we became involved with third-party claims, litigation, governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions. Acquisitions may also result in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results. To fund our acquisition of Microsemi, we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately $8.10 billion of additional debt. We may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, issuing Commercial Paper, raising debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or other mechanisms.\nFurther, if we decide to divest assets or a business, it may be difficult to find or complete divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies, which may include site closures, timely or on acceptable terms. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the desired divestiture, or the price or terms of the divestiture may be less favorable than we had anticipated. Even following a divestiture or other exit strategy, we may have certain continuing obligations to former employees, customers, vendors, landlords or other third parties. We may also have continuing liabilities related to former employees, assets or businesses. Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to enter into joint development agreements or other strategic relationships with other companies. These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction, to successfully market and sell products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.\nAs a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets. \nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. As of March 31, 2025, we had goodwill of $6.68 \nbillion and net intangible assets of $2.39 billion. In connection with the completion of our acquisition of Microsemi in May 2018, our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired.  Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry.  Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance.  Because we operate in highly competitive environments, projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results.  Through March 31, 2025, we have never recorded a goodwill impairment charge. There were no intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2025. If in future periods, we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate any future control deficiencies, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation with investors. \nWe have in the past identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to IT system access. Although such material weaknesses were remediated in fiscal 2020, there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in the future. If we cannot remediate future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner, or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report financial information and our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. In addition to the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to IT system access, which were remediated as of March 31, 2020, we have from time to time identified other significant deficiencies. If we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nCustomer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs. \nSome of our customers require that we implement practices that are more stringent than those required by applicable laws with respect to labor requirements, the materials contained in our products, energy efficiency, environmental impact or other items. To comply with such requirements, we may require our suppliers to adopt such practices. Our suppliers may in the future refuse to implement these practices, or may charge us more for complying with them. If certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the practices, we may be forced to source from alternate suppliers. The cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability, and if we do not implement such practices, such customers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in decreased revenue opportunities. Developing, enforcing, and auditing customer-requested practices at our own sites and in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require more personnel.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified personnel has intensified. \nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful, and competition for qualified personnel and available labor may intensify for a variety of reasons, including the increase in work-from-home arrangements, the wage inflation in our industry, and the demand for employees with expertise in developing fields such as AI.\nOur business relies on the ability to attract and retain skilled employees across various functions, including management, technical, marketing, sales, research and development, manufacturing, and operations. Our failure to attract and retain hardware and software engineers, as well as sales and marketing personnel, could delay product development and introduction, thereby adversely affecting our net sales. We depend on a direct labor force at our manufacturing facilities, and any inability to maintain this workforce could adversely affect our operations. This could lead to delays in production and shipments, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, and ultimately adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operational results. As the integration of AI becomes more prevalent, there is an anticipated shift in the skills required within the workforce, making AI literacy increasingly important for our employees. Competition for personnel with AI expertise may be intense and costly.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we began a global reduction of our work force that could negatively affect employee morale, and diminish our attractiveness as an employer. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, it could impair our ability to compete effectively. \nFurthermore, changes in immigration laws and regulations, or more robust enforcement of new or existing laws, may hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering personnel. In the U.S., where a portion of our research and development teams are based, stricter immigration controls could adversely affect the employment status of non-U.S. engineers and other key technical employees, as well as our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees. U.S. immigration policies may also make it more challenging to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates from U.S. universities.\nOur success depends on the contributions of our senior management team. We have experienced transitions with respect to certain members of our senior management due to retirements or other reasons in the past and may do so in the future. Effective succession planning is important for our long-term success and we have a program designed to address this risk. Because we have no employment agreements with our U.S. senior management team, they could leave with little or no notice, which could make it more difficult for us to execute our planned business strategy. The inability to find suitable replacements for senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. \nThe occurrence of events for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our insurance limits, may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity. \nWe have insurance coverage related to many different types of risk; however, we self-insure for some potentially significant risks and obligations, because we believe that it is more cost effective for us to self-insure than to pay the high premium costs. The risks and exposures that we self-insure include, but are not limited to, employee health matters, certain property matters, product defects, cybersecurity matters, employment risks, environmental matters, political risks, and intellectual property matters. Should there be a loss or adverse judgment in an area for which we are self-insured, then our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Products, Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Litigation\nWe continue to be the target of attacks on our IT systems. Interruptions in and unauthorized access to our IT systems, security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or data that we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process including data belonging to us, or our customers, suppliers, contractors or employees, could adversely affect our business. \nWe rely on the uninterrupted operation of complex IT systems and networks to operate our business.  Any improper handling of confidential data, or significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, any that may relate to new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches or incidents, cyber-attacks, ransom-style attacks, theft or tampering, inadvertent error, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts, security breaches or incidents in our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, or any data we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process, including but not limited to, data belonging to us or our customers, suppliers, contractors or employees, or any perception any of the foregoing has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, supply chain, sales and operating results, result in regulatory inquiries, investigations or other proceedings against us, result in claims, demands and litigation against us, or damage our reputation.  Such improper handling of confidential data, or system or network disruption, or any cyber-attack or other means of effectuating a security breach or incident, could result in loss or unavailability of all or a portion of our systems and business operations, and a loss, unavailability, an unauthorized release of, or other unauthorized use or processing of, personal data, or our suppliers’ or our customers’ intellectual property or confidential, proprietary or sensitive information. Any such matter, or any perception that it has occurred, could harm our \nbusiness or competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages, and may result in lower revenue, lower margins, regulatory investigations, inquiries or other proceedings, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, claims for damages, litigation, and fines, penalties, damages, other liabilities, and other sanctions.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience verifiable attacks on our IT systems and data, including network compromises, attempts to breach our security measures and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. For example, in August 2024, we determined that an unauthorized party disrupted our use of certain servers and some of our business operations. As a result, certain of our manufacturing facilities were operating at less than normal levels for a period of time, and our ability to fulfill orders was temporarily impacted. While we were able to bring the affected portions of our IT systems back online and restore normal business operations in response to this August 2024 incident without a material impact to our business, we cannot be certain that we would be able to achieve this result in the event of another cyber-attack. We routinely evaluate the effectiveness of the containment mechanisms that we have implemented and continue to implement additional measures. We analyzed the information that was compromised in August 2024 and we do not believe that this cyber incident has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us. New information can develop that may impact our assessment of cyber events, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations.\nDue to the types of products we sell and the significant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to U.S. government agencies, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future, attacks on our IT systems and data, including attempts to breach our security, network compromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. Geopolitical events and tensions may increase these risks. Also, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could use AI to develop malicious code, sophisticated phishing attempts, and convincing deep fakes. A deep fake is a manipulation of our content or the voices or images of our leaders to maliciously publish false messages that appear to be authentic. Such messages may harm our reputation, which may in turn have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits, and reduce the trading price of our stock. A threat could also be introduced by our or our customers and business partners use of AI tools. The output of these tools may include threats such as introducing malicious code when AI generated source code is incorporated into products or systems. Were any future attacks to be successful, or through the unintentional introduction of security vulnerability due to AI usage, we may be unaware of the incident, its magnitude, or its effects until significant harm is done. More generally, we may face significant delays in identifying, remediating, and otherwise responding to any interruption, disruption, security breach or incident.\nIn recent years, we have regularly implemented improvements to our protective measures that have included, but have not been limited to, implementation of the following: firewalls, endpoint intrusion detection and response software, regular patches, log monitors, event correlation tools, network segmentation, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, dual factor identification, data partitioning, privileged account segregation and monitoring, routine password modifications, and an enhanced information security program including training classes and phishing exercises for employees and contractors with system access, along with tabletop exercises conducted by information security personnel. As a result of the material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the IT systems compromise that we experienced in fiscal 2019, we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls and we are continuing to take actions to attempt to address evolving threats. However, our system improvements have not been fully effective in preventing attacks on our IT systems and data, including breaches of our security measures, and there can be no assurance that any future system improvements will be effective in preventing cyber-attacks or disruptions, a ransom-style attack, or limiting the damage from any cyber-attacks or disruptions. Our ability to recover from ransomware and other ransom-style attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring data from backups is delayed or not feasible. Our system improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and we may be required to dedicate additional expenditures and resources to making system improvements and otherwise addressing cybersecurity matters in the future, whether in response to any disruption, interruption, breach, incident or otherwise. Further, any future improvements, attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding our internal systems, defending litigation, complaints or other claims, providing notices to regulatory agencies or other third parties, responding to regulatory inquiries, actions or other proceedings, or paying damages, fines or penalties. Such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. Furthermore, our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, such as SEC rules requiring disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident, may be costly and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in investigations, proceedings, investor lawsuits and reputational damage.\nIn addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees, or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish, access, process or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third \nparties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk would be exacerbated to the extent our competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, hire our employees. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property, and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors.\nThird-party service providers, such as wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors, credit card processors, and other vendors have access to portions of our and our customers' data. These service providers also face significant cybersecurity threats, and they may be subject to cyber-attacks, disruptions, and interruptions to their networks and systems, and otherwise may suffer from security breaches and incidents. Any such breach or incident, including any involving misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized processing of data maintained or otherwise processed by our third-party service providers, or any perception any of these has occurred, could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our cybersecurity practices or measures. We do not have insurance coverage specially for cybersecurity matters. Insurance coverage that we do have may not be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our cybersecurity practices or measures or otherwise relating to any cybersecurity breach or incident, and we cannot be sure that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. \nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\nOur products, or IP that we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications that we implement in our products, may be subject to security vulnerabilities. And, while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Our products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity, privacy or safety risks including applications that gather and process data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and automotive applications. We, our customers, and the users of our products may not promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Additionally, new information can develop that may impact our assessment of a security vulnerability, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations, or become aware of additional variants or evaluate the competitiveness of products. \nSecurity vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, sales, customer relationships, share price, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available. This, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits of vulnerabilities, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.\nWe face risks to our business and proprietary confidential information due to use of AI.\nWe limit our employees’ use of third-party and open-source AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in accordance with our internal guidelines and procedures. However, the internal governance of the use of these technologies can be challenging, and our employees and consultants may use these tools on an unauthorized basis and our partners may use these tools, which poses additional risks relating to the protection of data, including the potential exposure of our proprietary confidential or other controlled information to unauthorized recipients and the misuse of our or third-party intellectual property. Use of AI tools may result in allegations or claims against us related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, unauthorized access to or use of proprietary information, failure to comply with open-source software requirements, and failure to comply with actual or asserted legal or other obligations. AI tools may also produce inaccurate responses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product development or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective \nmaintaining, training, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate guidelines and procedures governing the use of AI tools, and the results of any such use, by us or our partners.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of technologies, including new and evolving technologies such as AI, in our internal operations, products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI enabling products, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to use AI in our internal operations or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the EU, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. New and updated AI regulations could impose onerous obligations that may disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nOur failure to comply with federal, state, or international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally regarding privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity, such as the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. equivalent to the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and the EU Cyber Resilience Act and Cybersecurity Act. The scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Some of these laws create a broad definition of personal information, establish data privacy rights, impose data breach notification requirements, and create potentially severe statutory damages or other remedial frameworks and private rights of action for certain data breaches. Some of the laws and regulations also place restrictions on our ability to collect, store, use, transmit and process personal information and other data across our business. For example, the GDPR restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and other countries. Some of these laws mandate data-handling and cybersecurity requirements, conformity assessments and incident reporting such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model. Further, such laws and regulations have resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies such as us that have employees, customers, and operations in the EEA or make sales into government-related projects.\nWe have relied mainly on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), for transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.S. or other countries. However, the Court of Justice of the EU in a July 2020 decision (Schrems II) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield), and also called for stricter conditions in the use of the SCCs. Following the Schrems II decision, certain data protection authorities in the EU have issued statements advising companies within their jurisdiction not to transfer personal data to the U.S. under the SCCs. The EU and U.S. have established a successor framework to the Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), but it already has faced a legal challenge and may face additional legal challenges. If we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from the EEA are lawful, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions and substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal information from the EEA. The loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of the EEA may cause reluctance or refusal by European customers to communicate with us as they are currently, and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in the EEA at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of the EEA have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products in those jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the GDPR and the U.K. equivalent of the GDPR expose us to two parallel data protection regimes in Europe, each of which potentially authorizes fines and enforcement actions for certain violations. Substantial fines may be imposed for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4% of a company’s worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Although the U.K. data protection regime currently permits data transfers from the U.K. to \nthe EEA and other third countries, covered by a European Commission 'adequacy decision' through the continued use of SCCs and binding corporate rules, these laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could have adverse implications for our transfer of personal data from the U.K. to the EEA and other third countries. Additionally, new and updated AI regulations could impose onerous obligations that may disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.\nIn the U.S., federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity. For example, California has enacted the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CPRA, which became operative January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA’s requirements, including applying to personal information of business representatives and employees and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Additionally, numerous other states have proposed or enacted laws addressing privacy and security, many of which impose obligations similar to those of the CCPA. The U.S. federal government also has laws regarding handling of government-regulated data (e.g., controlled unclassified information, classified data, export controlled data) and is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The CCPA, and other evolving legislation relating to privacy, data protection, and information security may impact our business activities and require us to modify our policies and practices.\nIf other jurisdictions enact similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, it would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and non-compliance could result in fines or other sanctions from regulators. The inability to transfer personal data to the U.S. could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWhile we plan to continue to undertake efforts to conform to current legal and regulatory obligations and to account for relevant best practices, such efforts may be unsuccessful or result in significant costs. We may also experience reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to provide us with personal data due to the potential risk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by applicable data protection laws or by certain data protection authorities. These and any other laws relating to privacy or data protection and handling and their interpretations continue to develop and their uncertainty and inconsistency may increase the cost of compliance, cause compliance challenges, restrict our ability to offer products in certain locations in the same way that we have been, and potentially adversely affect certain third-party service providers. Further, any actual or alleged failure by us or our service providers to comply with laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection and handling, or cybersecurity may subject us to claims, demands, and litigation, sanctions or fines by regulators, and other damages and liabilities. Any of the foregoing may harm our reputation and market position and otherwise could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, investigations or claims. \nWe are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings, investigations or claims regarding intellectual property rights, product defects, breach of contracts, export controls and sanctions, and other matters. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us, our direct or indirect customers, or our licensees. These legal proceedings and claims, even if meritless, have in the past and could in the future result in unexpected and substantial costs to us. If we are unable to resolve or settle a matter, obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, reengineer products or processes to avoid infringement, provide a cost-effective remedy, or successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incur uninsured liability in any of them, be required to take a charge to operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes, suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories, incur reputational damage, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nIt is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture, performance, or use of our products. These claims may be due to injuries, economic damage, lost intellectual property, or environmental exposures related to manufacturing, a product's nonconformance to our or our customer’s specifications, changes in our manufacturing processes, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers. We could incur significant expenses related to such matters, including, but not limited to:\n•costs related to writing off the value of our inventory of nonconforming products;\n•recalling nonconforming products;\n•providing support services, product replacements, or modifications to products and the defense of such claims;\n•diversion of resources from other projects;\n•lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders, unpaid receivables, or reimbursement of costs or damages;\n•customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements; and\n•a requirement to pay damages, penalties or recall costs.\nBecause the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell, the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the revenue and profits we received. While we exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities. Further, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by law. We have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects, but we do not expect that insurance will fully protect against such claims. Payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nFurther, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense, safety, security, and medical, where failure of the application could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. We will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products.\nOur contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities.\nWe do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our non-distributor customers, and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers. Further, except for a few LTSAs, that are still in place, the customer contracts that we enter into generally do not require any specified level of purchases and allow customers to cancel orders or terminate the contract with limited restrictions. Under our LTSAs, customers may cancel orders in the event of price increases. While we had approximately 109,000 customers, and our ten largest direct customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue in fiscal 2025, and four of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers, cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits. For example, due to uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Also, many of our customers felt the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, and customer requests to push-out or cancel backlog and our accommodation of their requests increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and continued in fiscal 2024 and the first half of fiscal 2025.\nCertain customer contracts differ from our standard terms of sale due to the negotiating leverage held by the customer. For example, under certain contracts we have committed to supply products on scheduled delivery dates, or extended our obligations for liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or intellectual property infringement. If we are unable to supply the customer as contractually required, the customer may incur additional production costs, lost revenues due to delays in their manufacturing schedule, or quality-related issues. We may be liable for costs and damages associated with customer claims, and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay associated legal fees. While we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions, manage the risks of such liabilities, and set caps on our liability exposure, sometimes we are unable to do so. In order to win important designs, avoid losing business to competitors, maintain existing business, or be permitted to bid on new business, we have, and may in the future, have to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or product failure, or have to agree to liquidated damage provisions. This exposes us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products sold under such contracts, the lifetime revenues we receive under such contracts, or potential consequential damages. Further, where we do not have negotiated customer contracts, our customer's order terms may govern the transaction and contain terms unfavorable to us. These risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in competitive harm, lost revenue or market opportunities. \nOur ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success. To that end, we have acquired certain patents and licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes. The process of seeking patent protection can be expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. In addition, our existing and new patents, trademarks and copyrights that are issued may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or \ncommercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patent offices of a foreign country or U.S. or foreign courts, which can require significant financial resources. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third-party could result in harm to our competitive position, uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us. Although we continue to aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.\nCertain of our software, as well as that of our customers, may be derived from “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its authors. Open source software licenses impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to legally establish that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license is terminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernments and courts are considering new issues in intellectual property law with respect to works created by AI technology, which could result in changing and inconsistent intellectual property rights in development processes, procedures and technologies we create with AI technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Taxation, Laws and Regulations \nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices. \nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the FASB and the SEC. New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. New accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.\nRegulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products or import supplies could issue new export controls or trade sanctions, levy fines, restrict or delay our ability to export products or import supplies, or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products. \nA significant portion of our sales involve export and import activities. Our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology or U.S. software, or products incorporating U.S. content may be subject to laws and regulations administrated by various agencies including those under the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury, that govern international trade, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), International Traffic in Arms Regulations, economic embargoes and tariffs or other trade sanctions against certain countries and parties. Licenses or license exceptions are often required for the shipment of our products to certain countries. Our inability to timely obtain a license, for any reason, including a delay in license processing due to a federal government shutdown, or changes in government policies of approval or denial of licenses, could cause a delay in scheduled shipments which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of a shutdown, and in following quarters depending on the extent that license processing is delayed. Further, determination by a government that we have failed to comply with trade regulations or anti-bribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges, fines, penalties, and seizure of products, or loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and earnings. A change in laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries, customers, distributors or others. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department published a regulation that imposed restrictions on activities in or involving China, Hong Kong, and Macau related to advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), advanced-node ICs, computers and other commodities that contain such ICs, certain semiconductor manufacturing items, and supercomputers. The regulation also expanded controls on transactions involving semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor equipment manufacturing end-uses. Further, this regulation expanded the scope of foreign-produced items subject to license requirements under U.S. law and added 28 entities located in China to the U.S. Commerce Department Entity List. In November 2023, the U.S. Commerce Department added restrictions and export license requirements to end uses and product categories previously described in the October 2022 regulation. To date, the U.S. Commerce Department has issued a number of regulations that further restrict transactions involving semiconductors and related products. In addition, the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury have been adding parties to the \nrestricted parties lists, and imposing prohibitions and export licensing requirements on transactions with them. The result of these additional restrictions and the change in the U.S. Administration in 2025 is that there has been a slow-down in the processing of export license applications by the U.S. Government and an increased burden on us to conduct additional due diligence imposed by the regulations, as well as by sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. At this time, there has not been a material impact on our ability to obtain necessary licenses for exportation. A previous example occurred in fiscal 2020, when the U.S. Commerce Department effectively banned U.S. companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain Chinese companies, including Huawei and their related companies worldwide. In fiscal 2020, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibited U.S. governmental agencies from buying equipment incorporating covered telecommunications equipment, as a substantial component or critical technology, where the technology came from certain Chinese companies. In July 2020, this was expanded to prohibit U.S. governmental agencies from entering into a contract with any company that uses covered telecommunications equipment whether or not the Chinese technology is related to the procurement. Since then, similar restrictions have been imposed under the National Defense and Authorization Act when supply chain includes certain Chinese entities. The EAR also effectively prohibits sales of items for a “military end use,” to a \"military end-user,\" or for a \"military intelligence\" end-user, or end-use to certain countries, such as Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, Cuba, China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria and Venezuela. Any of the foregoing changes to the regulatory requirements could adversely impact our operational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business. Any one or more of these sanctions, future sanctions, a change in laws or regulations, or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, implemented trade restrictions, and introduced national security protection policies. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, have continued to escalate from 2018 to present, and include the U.S. increasing tariffs on Chinese origin goods and China increasing tariffs on U.S. origin goods. Additionally, the U.S has imposed a baseline 10% tariff on almost all imported goods globally. We previously took steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business by adjusting our operations and supply chain, but may be unable to mitigate the costs of additional tariffs, including those imposed in March and April of 2025. Although these tariff increases did not result in a material adverse impact on our operating costs in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020, they did reduce demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Increased tariffs on our customers' products could adversely impact their sales, and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products. Further, governments may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any applications containing our products. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to sales of certain raw materials and to sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, and they may direct companies within China to purchase Chinese-made products. Similar restrictions on our products or the products of our customers or suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results. It is also possible that evolving U.S. export controls may encourage non-U.S. governments to request that our customers purchase from companies not subject to U.S. export controls, thereby harming our business, market position, and financial results. Excessive export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. \nFurther changes in trade or national security protection policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, including those taken against the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. policies, may limit our ability to obtain equipment, components or raw materials (including rare earth minerals), limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, reduce our ability to sell products, or reduce our ability to have mergers and acquisitions approved by governmental agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nThe outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns and existing tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \nWe are subject to examination of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns for fiscal 2007 and later. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from current or future examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial position and results of operations.\nIn September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In \nDecember 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice. In September 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (2014 to 2015 Notice) from the IRS for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. The disputed amounts for fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2023, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice.\nIn May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for fiscal 2020. In December 2023, we received a Notice of Assessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. In March 2025, we entered into a Consent Judgment before the High Court, agreeing that the dispute will be heard before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT). It was also agreed that the payment on the taxes assessed is stayed and the IRB will pause all enforcement and proceedings against the collection of the taxes assessed until the appeal before the SCIT is concluded. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.\nIn January 2025, we received several assessments from the German Tax Authorities (GTA) regarding the German extraterritorial taxation of royalty payments between nonresidents (referred to as offshore receipts in respect of intangible property or ORIP) and intellectual property transfers by nonresidents (referred to as extraterritorial capital gains taxation or ETT). If the assessment is upheld, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $92.0 million. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.\nThe ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS, IRB, and GTA were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nExposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities, changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition and results of operations. \nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including changes to our operating structure, intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies.\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion Profit Shifting recommendations, or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns. \nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by policies implemented globally by the current or future administrations. \nThe U.S. and certain other global jurisdictions in which we operate, have taken and have threatened to take significant legislative and policy changes in areas including but not limited to tariffs, taxes and trade, labor, and the environment. If implemented, these changes could increase our effective tax rate, decrease our revenue and increase our selling, general, administrative and/or manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. Changes in tariffs, tax policy, trade regulations or other matters, and any uncertainty surrounding the scope or timing of such changes, could negatively impact the stock market, and reduce the trading price of our stock or otherwise impact our business. For example, in February 2022, the U.S. began implementing widescale sanctions against Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions against Belarus and certain Ukrainian regions were later implemented. Because the actions by Russia against Ukraine are in conflict with our Guiding Values, we chose to cease shipments into Russia and Belarus, and we will continue to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions regarding Ukraine. While sales of our products into these regions, and to customers that sell into these regions, have been negatively impacted, at this time, we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our revenue. Retaliatory acts by Russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber-attacks, sanctions, or other actions that could disrupt the economy. As a result of the foregoing risks or similar risks, \nthe imposition of sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNew technology trends, such as AI and cyber resiliency and security requirements, require us and our customers to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. In the U.S., the EU, and China, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and impact both us and our customers.  These changes could impact our internal use and development of AI, and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental, climate change and other regulations, which may force us to incur significant expenses and impact our operations. \nWe must comply with federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, emissions, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes, or that are the result of our manufacturing operations, such as greenhouse gases. We must also comply with rules and regulations regarding limiting greenhouse gas emissions, public reporting of environmental metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous substances, and obtain third-party assurance of greenhouse gas reporting. Regulations could require us to change manufacturing processes, substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, obtain new permits and undertake other costly activities. \nOur failure to comply, or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied, with regulations could result in significant fines, litigation or administrative actions by regulators or others, liability for clean-up, criminal and civil liabilities, import/export restrictions, reduction or suspension of production, cessation of operations or future liabilities. Restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as the need for additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap and trade programs, and could also result in reduction or suspension of production, or even cessation of operations. Such regulations have required us in the past, and could require us in the future, to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations. Our failure to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could not only impact the health of our employees, customers and communities in which we operate, but could also impact our ability to operate. Such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our products, shipping materials or logistics, or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses. Environmental laws continue to expand with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products and shipping materials. Future environmental regulations could require us to close or reduce production at certain facilities, reengineer certain of our existing products and may prevent us or make it more expensive for us to manufacture, sell and ship our products. For example, in Colorado, Regulation 27 requires companies operating in Colorado to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a short timeframe. Because we have contractual obligations to certain customers to assess the impact that manufacturing process changes may have on the products that we provide to such customers, we have to take a measured approach when implementing changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing inputs. If we are unable to implement the necessary abatement plan, we may be required to ramp down our existing operations significantly or risk noncompliance with the rule. The magnitude of the penalties that may be imposed for non-compliance is not currently known but could include significant monetary penalties and orders to reduce or cease production.\nIn March 2022, the SEC proposed a rule entitled Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors which it then adopted March 6, 2024. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC announced that it was delaying the implementation of the rule pending challenge in the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court. While the rule is not yet implemented, if it were to be implemented in its current form, we would incur significant additional costs of compliance due to the need for expanded data collection, analysis, and certification. \nIn addition, the number and complexity of laws and customer requirements focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products, the recycling of electronic products, the reduction of chemicals used in and to manufacture electronic products, and the reduction in the amount of packing materials and the increase in the required recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly. It may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may have insufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs, thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability. We may have to write off inventory if we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations. We expect these risks to continue. These requirements may increase our own costs, as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain.\nSustained adverse climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations. \nVoluntary actions we may take or have taken as part of our ESG initiatives could require us to limit emissions, change manufacturing processes, substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. Voluntary restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as the need for additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap and trade programs. The cost of compliance with such voluntary efforts could restrict our manufacturing operations, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nSustained adverse changes in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us due to the effects of extreme weather and climate events on our production facilities, our supply chain and customers. Utility shortages, higher costs of utilities, and reduced availability of water could disrupt our operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers. Certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions, which some experts believe may become vulnerable to more frequent fires, storms, severe floods and droughts. While our business recovery plans are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other disruptive events, our plans may not protect us from all events.\n\nCustomer demands and regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses. \nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC released investigation, and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have filed a Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters annually since June 2, 2014. Other countries are considering similar regulations. If we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing, customers and others may demand that we change the sourcing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, even if the costs for compliant materials significantly increases or availability is limited.  If we change materials or suppliers, there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity, delivery times and quality could be negatively impacted.  Our relationships with customers, suppliers and stockholders may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing. We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products.  We may be unable to satisfy those that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the Responsible Minerals Initiative or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  If we are unable to meet customer requirements, customers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer or a reduction in purchases from us, and we may have to write off inventory if it cannot be sold.\nIn addition to concerns over “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, our customers may require that other minerals and substances used within our supply chain be evaluated and reported on. An increase in reporting obligations will increase associated operating costs. This could have negative effects on our overall operating profits.\nFailure to meet ESG expectations, standards or disclosure requirements or achieve our corporate responsibility goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. \nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus on corporate responsibility matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, data privacy, cybersecurity, trade controls, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, use of products for illegal or unethical purposes, human rights, and social responsibility. We are committed to corporate responsibility and actively manage these issues in accordance with applicable law and including through our guiding values and our internal policies. As an example, since we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products to customers and distributors located in Russia and Belarus. However, we have been made aware that there are entities in Russia that indirectly obtained our products after March 2022 despite the preventative measures we took and continue to take. Though we continue to improve our processes and procedures to prevent the unauthorized flow of our products, our actions have not been fully successful. We operate in an extensive, ever-changing global supply chain, an expectation of complete traceability of standard semiconductor products to every end use and prevention of product misuse and diversion is unachievable. Thus, despite our efforts, our products may be used for illegal or objectionable applications and third parties may engage in conduct \nthat we do not support or condone.\nAlso, we have publicly announced environmental goals including those related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, achieving net zero carbon emissions and renewable energy usage, which we may refine or expand further in the future. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. These goals could expose us to heightened scrutiny and financial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impact us.\nIn addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and climate-change disclosure requirements from the SEC. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the SEC and other regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG goals.\nEvolving stakeholder expectations, voluntary and required reporting regimes that are not harmonized and continue to change, and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals, present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price. It is also possible that government, customers, investors and other stakeholders might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include:\n•reputational harm, including damage to our relationship with customers, supplies, investors, governments, or other stakeholders;\n•we may lose customers who choose not to do business with us, or we may choose to discontinue or restrict business with certain customers due to our policies;\n•liabilities or penalties associated with inadequate processes to collect, audit, or disclose information;\n•adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;\n•increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action;\n•unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;\n•diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on ESG metrics;\n•our ability to achieve our goals within announced timeframes;\n•increased costs and resources to monitor, report and achieve our goals;\n•unforeseen operational and technological difficulties;\n•access to and increased cost of capital; and\n•adverse impacts on our stock price.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations or industry standards, or achieve our corporate responsibility goals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, or stock price. \nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets\nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. \nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the recent past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n•global economic and financial uncertainty due to changes in tariffs, interest rates, persistent inflation, instability in the banking sector, war or other conflicts, public health concerns or other factors;\n•political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;\n•quarterly variations in our operating results, financial condition, including our liquidity, or the operating results of other technology companies;\n•changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;\n•changes in analysts' estimates of our financial performance or buy/sell recommendations;\n•general conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n•the amount and timing of repurchases of shares of our common stock;\n•our ability to realize the expected benefits of our completed or future acquisitions; \n•announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations; and\n•actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock. The foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares to decline or fluctuate substantially. In the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the target of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an adverse impact on our financial performance and the price of our common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. \nThe amount and timing of our share repurchases may fluctuate in response to a variety of factors. \nThe amount, timing, and execution of repurchases of shares of our common stock may fluctuate based on the share price of our common stock, general business and market conditions, tax regulations impacting share repurchases and other factors including our operating results, level of cash flow, capital expenditures and dividend payments. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $4.00 billion, of which $1.56 billion is still available, the authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and may affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility. We did not repurchase any shares in the March 2025 quarter.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage or refinance our current or future debt. \nAs of March 31, 2025, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $5.66 billion. At March 31, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility which provides up to $2.25 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2030 and $175.0 million in outstanding principal amount of our Commercial Paper. At March 31, 2025, we had $4.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and $1.29 billion in aggregate principal of Convertible Debt outstanding. \nWith respect to such balance of Senior Notes, our 4.250% 2025 Notes in the principal amount of $1.20 billion matures on September 1, 2025, and we intend to finance the repayment of such notes using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper program. Since interest rates have increased since we issued our 4.250% 2025 Notes, we expect our interest expense will increase if we refinance such notes using our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper Program or other instruments. Also, if we refinance such fixed rate notes with variable rate debt, changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our interest expense in future periods. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our current or future debt on reasonable terms, if at all. \nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, we may not have sufficient cash to fund payments and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets. \nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding Senior Notes, Convertible Debt, and Commercial Paper, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases or acquisitions. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to undertake alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on onerous or highly dilutive terms. Recently, we have used borrowings to finance a portion of our quarterly dividend payments and we may continue to do so in future periods. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our Senior Notes and Commercial Paper are rated by certain major credit rating agencies. These credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and financial metrics including debt levels. While we have maintained our investment grade rating, we were recently downgraded by one rating agency and there is no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A \ndowngrade of our credit rating by a major credit rating agency could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt. Our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \nConversion of our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, or the payment of dividends on Series A Preferred Stock in shares of common stock, will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. \nThe conversion of some or all of our shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the form of common stock or the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of such debt. Following our irrevocable settlement election made on April 1, 2022, upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to such converted Convertible Debt by delivering cash equal to the principal amount of such converted Convertible Debt and cash and shares of common stock or any combination, at our option, with respect to any conversion value in excess thereof (i.e., the conversion spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the Convertible Debt as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share. Any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares or the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the form of common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable, could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares. The market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by: (1) investors’ anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock received upon conversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares; (2) possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of common stock; and (3) hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving the Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares and our common stock.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock a liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results. \nWe use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of our non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, in periods when the value of a non-U.S. currency significantly declines relative to the U.S. dollar, customers transacting in that currency may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products. In periods when the U.S. dollar declines significantly relative to the British pound, Euro, Thai baht and Taiwan dollar, the operational costs in our European and Thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected. Although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, there can be no assurance as to the future \nimpact that any weakness or strength in the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.",
