We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements.\nOverview \nCadence® is a global market leader that develops computational, AI-driven software, accelerated hardware, and intellectual property (“IP”) solutions for engineers and scientists to bring new and innovative products to life. The world’s most innovative technology companies use our solutions and services to deliver transformational products to multiple industries that drive the global economy. The products these companies develop are some of the most complex systems in the world. Since our inception, we have been at the forefront of technology innovation. We work closely with our customers, helping them solve their most complex challenges in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries to unlock limitless opportunities.\nOur customers include semiconductor companies that design and manufacture semiconductor devices and systems companies that design and manufacture products containing many different types of semiconductors, which they either make themselves or buy from a semiconductor company. Semiconductors, also referred to as integrated circuits (“ICs”), or chips, are the heart of almost every industry. Semiconductors are the catalyst for innovation in many industries including automotive, aerospace, biotech, hyperscale and cloud computing, data centers, telecommunications, medical technology, industrial internet of things (“IIoT”), and AI. They are found in a wide variety of consumer products such as cell phones, automobiles, computers, home appliances, home security, drones, and home entertainment systems.\n Business Strategy\nOur Intelligent System Design™ (“ISD”) strategy allows us to deliver solutions to our customers to solve their most complex product development challenges. Our industry-leading computational software, accelerated hardware, and IP enable us to adapt to our customer's dynamic design requirements, allowing them to meet their critical business and environmental concerns including time-to-market and sustainability. The creation of even the most seemingly simple electronic systems and products typically includes a complex design process and requires highly trained engineers with various areas of specialized knowledge and skill sets. Our ability to deliver innovative products that keep up with increasing complexity allows our customers to be successful in meeting their business goals and objectives.\nHistorically, the industry that provided the software tools IC engineers used was called Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”). The pace of technical innovation in EDA has been driven by a concept known as Moore’s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 18-24 months. Our strategy, illustrated in the graphic below, is focused on three primary areas: Design Excellence, System Innovation, and Pervasive Intelligence.\nDesign Excellence focuses on our core technology and deep understanding of computational software, accelerated computing, machine learning, and AI to develop best-in-class electronic design and analysis semiconductor solutions. In this area, customers are primarily developing large chips including those used in computers, laptops, cellphones, medical devices, games and entertainment systems, and many other types of consumer electronics. Design Excellence applies to all types of semiconductor electronics including CPUs, GPUs, MCUs, memory, radio frequency (“RF”), analog, and mixed-signal, in both mainstream and advanced semiconductor process nodes.\nSystem Innovation builds on our foundation of Design Excellence and deep expertise in computational algorithms and expands that expertise to include multiphysics-based analysis of systems that contain electronic devices, including printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), devices with advanced packaging technology, and 3-dimensional IC (“3D-IC”). This gives customers designing full systems containing multiple electronic devices, the ability to verify that their products will work as intended under various physical conditions. Some examples of electronic systems are a computer motherboard, the electronics in a cellphone, or the electronic transmission or infotainment system in an automobile.\nPervasive Intelligence incorporates AI training and inference algorithms in our solutions to help customers optimize performance and productivity with improved quality of results for their products. The amount of data produced in the design phase of their products has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. We implement generative AI agents to analyze large data sets and break through the limitations of the conventional human-intensive optimization process to achieve optimal design solutions expeditiously and without compromising accuracy. \nOur software and hardware products also support cloud access to address our customers' growing computational needs. Customers can access our solutions via our Cadence OnCloud Platform.\nBusiness Drivers\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative semiconductor and electronic systems that are driven by key trends, including foundries creating new advanced transistor devices and processes, semiconductor companies designing electrical systems, systems companies designing semiconductors, the hyper-convergence between electrical and mechanical systems, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving, and 5G. These trends are accelerated by the AI super cycle. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers’ need to invest in new designs and products that are highly differentiated. \nGenerative AI is reshaping the entire semiconductor and systems industry development process. From our perspective, the AI super cycle we are experiencing will influence our key business opportunities along three horizons, which are Infrastructure AI, Physical AI and Life Sciences AI. The first horizon, Infrastructure AI, is being driven by data centers and hyperscale computing to provide the necessary power to run AI workloads. The second horizon, Physical AI, is the integration of AI with autonomous systems. It will drive many applications such as automobiles, industrial robots, and many other autonomous systems. The third horizon, Life Sciences AI, is the application of AI and computer science to biology to drive advancements in the medical and life sciences industries.\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities. This dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development (“R&D”) to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with the design of electronic products, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have differentiated attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturability, reliability and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to sustainability initiatives by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy.\nProduct Categories\nEngineers use our solutions to complete critical steps in the design process, which includes creating, implementing, and verifying the design for functionality, manufacturability and other required industry-related compliance standards. Much of an engineer's time spent with our solutions during the design process involves running simulations to verify that their design will work as expected. Our technology, enhanced by AI, allows our customers to build a virtual model or digital twin that accurately predicts how their design will work. The ability to perform these simulations leads to significant time and cost savings for our customers as they can find and fix critical design problems before building their products. Our customers rely on our solutions to ensure their products perform safely and reliably.\nIn alignment with our Intelligent System Design strategy, we define our solutions in three product categories: Core EDA, Semiconductor IP, and System Design and Analysis (“SD&A”). Core EDA includes our software, hardware, and services used to design and verify a wide variety of semiconductors. Our Semiconductor IP portfolio includes silicon subsystems, software, and services that are used in semiconductor design. The SD&A category includes our software and services used to design and verify a wide variety of physical electronic systems. Leveraging our AI and computational software expertise, we have integrated the multiphysics domain (also known as “computational fluid dynamics,” or “CFD”) with our EDA solutions to provide customers with complete system-level design and analysis solutions. These categories are tightly integrated to provide complete design solutions for our customers. \nCore EDA\nOur Core EDA product category addresses the design and verification for a wide variety of semiconductor chips and manufacturing process technologies. Examples of the types of chips include analog, custom, digital, mixed-signal, memory, microwave, silicon photonics, and RF. The types of devices addressed by Core EDA covers a wide range of industries including automotive, aero and defense, hyperscale computing and data center, mobile communication, medical devices, and consumer electronics. As the complexity of chip design, semiconductor process technology, and electronic system design has increased, we have been incorporating the latest advances in machine learning and generative AI to drive significant improvements for our customers’ design quality of results and engineering productivity. \nCustom IC Design and Simulation\nVirtuoso Studio is the foundation of our solution platform for custom, analog, mixed-signal, photonics, and RF semiconductors. It is a complete AI-enabled solution that integrates the key Cadence technology required for silicon design, layout, and verification. Engineers use this solution to define the chip functionality (schematic) and physical layout descriptions for the complete design of chips, advanced packaged devices, and PCBs. Designs are functionally verified in simulation with the Spectre simulation solution. We believe Spectre is the gold standard for circuit design including analog, custom, memory, silicon photonics, and RF. Pegasus Physical Verification, our physical verification solution, is fully integrated with Virtuoso.\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\nThe Innovus Implementation System is the foundation of our full-flow digital IC design and signoff solution. A typical digital full-flow solution has four primary areas, which include creating the functional description (design synthesis), performing functional verification, running the physical implementation (place and route), and performing sign-off checks for manufacturing. The Innovus Implementation System is integrated with the key full-flow solution areas. For functional design, customers use the Genus Synthesis solution. For sign-off checks, customers use the Quantus Extraction, Timing Signoff, Voltus C Power Integrity, and Pegasus Physical Verification solutions. While these are the main areas in the digital flow, there are other important technology solutions for a comprehensive flow that includes the need for test synthesis, logic equivalence checking, high level power analysis, and optimization. The solutions are Joules™ RTL Power, which is designed to deliver fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy, and Cadence Modus DFT software, which reduces system-on-chip (“SoC”) design-for-test time. Cadence Cerebrus™ is our generative AI solution that combines all elements of the full-flow IC through signoff, enabling additional productivity, automation, and improved quality of results throughout the entire design flow.\nFunctional Verification\nAs mentioned above, functional verification is an important aspect of the design process. Design engineers rely heavily on the capability to verify that the chip's functional description is equivalent to the physical description used to manufacture the silicon. Functional verification is done multiple times throughout the design process as changes are incorporated, with the objective of identifying as many potential functional issues as possible before manufacturing the circuitry, thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product. We offer two functional verification software solutions, the Jasper Formal Verification Platform, and the Xcelium™ Parallel Logic Simulation Platform. These software solutions help engineers compare the functional view of the design with its physical view to make sure they match and help ensure that the design will successfully pass all functional tests.\nOur hardware acceleration and software prototyping solutions address another important aspect of functional verification in design flows. This capability is essential for chips that are used in high-performance computers like microprocessors, graphics processors, and AI processor chips. Some of the functional tests for these designs are so large that they may take weeks or even months to complete. Hardware acceleration, also known as emulation, and software prototyping can reduce these large simulations to hours or a few days. Our Palladium® Enterprise Emulation Platform and Protium™ field programmable gate arrays (“FPGA”)-Based Prototyping Platforms are for more comprehensive chip verification, often running low-level embedded software on top of a model of the chip, to ensure proper functionality before silicon manufacturing. These engines are used for early bug detection, verification of block-level functionality, verification acceleration and emulation of system-level functionality, system-level power exploration, analysis and optimization, and system-level prototyping for hardware/software co-verification. Our Palladium platform provides high throughput, capacity, data center reliability, and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardware-software systems. The Protium platform leverages a common front end with the Palladium environment to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage, enabling software development to begin weeks to months earlier than otherwise possible. Verisium™ is our generative AI solution for multi-run verification that enables additional productivity, automation, and quality of results throughout the entire verification flow. \nSemiconductor IP\nOur semiconductor IP product category includes strategic and mission-critical design architectures that our customers use to integrate into their highly differentiated design blocks, SoC subsystems, and chiplets. These are typically designed into silicon chips that are found in high volume in multiple markets such as automotive, hyperscale, mobile computing, and many consumer products including mobile phones, and AI chips. Our IP offerings include controllers and physical interfaces, which are commonly used in computing, networking, and embedded systems. We have a broad portfolio of PCI Express, Universal Accelerator Link, Compute Express Link, multiple memory interfaces including High Bandwidth Memory and Graphics Double Data Rate, and many other standards. In addition, our portfolio includes a wide variety of digital signal processor IPs. Our Tensilica® configurable digital signal processors are vertically targeted subsystems for AI, audio/voice, baseband and vision/imaging applications, controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog IP. Our design IP portfolio includes solutions for high speed serializer/deserializer (“SerDes”), peripheral component interconnect (“PCI”), USB, and many other standards. In addition to the IP portfolio listed above, customers rely on our Verification IP (“VIP”) portfolio to perform system-level validation. The VIP models are designed to work seamlessly with our Xcelium™ simulator and Palladium® Enterprise Emulation solutions. \nWe also offer design services to provide customers with end-to-end solutions from design specifications to final working silicon. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired Invecas, a leading provider of design engineering, embedded software, and system-level solutions. With this acquisition, we have added a highly skilled system design engineering team with expertise in providing IP design services for a wide variety of advanced node and mixed-signal chip designs, verification, product engineering, advanced packaging, and embedded software.\nSystem Design and Analysis\nOur SD&A product category is a comprehensive multiphysics platform that helps our customers design and simulate electronics and entire systems. It encompasses key areas of analysis including electromagnetic, thermal, structure, computational fluid dynamics, molecular, PCB and packaging, mechanical and structural analysis. \nThe capabilities in the Allegro® System Design Platform include PCB design and implementation, IC package and system-in-package design, signal and power integrity analysis, and PCB library design management and collaboration. The need for compact, high-performance mobile, consumer, and automotive design with advanced serial interconnect is driving the technological evolution of our PCB offerings. For mainstream PCB customers, where individual or small team productivity is a focus, we provide the OrCAD® family of offerings, which are primarily marketed worldwide through a network of resellers. Allegro X AI™ is our generative AI solution designed to provide significant cycle-time compression for PCB design, enhancing an engineer’s productivity.\nThe speed and proximity of signals on silicon, through packages to boards, and through connectors and cables, exposes these communications to various kinds of interference, generates heat, and emits electromagnetic radiation. Careful analysis is required for these systems to work as designed under a wide range of operating conditions, standards, and regulatory laws. The complexity of these devices and signal transmissions requires analysis and simulation throughout the product lifecycle to meet these objectives. Our Clarity™ 3D Solver for electromagnetic and power electronics analysis and simulation, as well as our Celsius™ Thermal Solver, provide the foundation for multiphysics analysis technology, with complete electrical-thermal co-simulation for electronic systems from ICs to physical enclosures. \nOur Fidelity™ CFD Software expands our ability to meet the growing design challenges of electronic and systems companies. Fidelity CFD is a physics-based analysis solution for mechanical design and complements the electronic system analysis portfolio. Our comprehensive suite of computational fluid dynamics (“CFD”) solutions enables our customers to extend their multiphysics analysis workflows to address simulation and analysis challenges for applications such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, propulsion, turbomachinery, heat transfer, and combustion. Optimality™ Intelligent System Explorer is the industry’s first generative AI-driven multiphysics optimization solution. It delivers additional productivity, automation, and improved system-level power, performance and area and quality of results throughout the entire analysis flow. \nOur Cadence Reality Digital Twin platform brings physics-based design and analysis to the data center sector for performance-aware design and operational planning. Data center professionals can future-proof designs and assess operational decisions with this digital twin and empower designers, owners, and operators to address the need for reliability, capacity, and energy efficiency.\nWith our acquisition of BETA CAE Systems International AG (“BETA CAE”) in fiscal 2024, we expanded our multiphysics simulation capabilities to include mechanical and structural analysis. BETA CAE’s industry-leading solutions include ANSA for pre-processing and full-flow model development, META for post-processing and analysis, EPILYSIS for structural analysis, and FATIQ for fatigue and failure analysis. These solutions along with the rest of BETA CAE’s portfolio address mechanical and structural design challenges in several markets including aerospace, automotive, biomechanics, construction, energy, crash and safety, industrial equipment, marine, and robotics.\nOur Millennium™ Multiphysics Enterprise Platform is an industry-first turnkey AI-enabled digital twin. Millennium M1 is the first release and is designed to overcome traditional CFD speed/accuracy and compute resource limitations with a combination of GPU resident CFD solvers such as Fidelity LES for large eddy simulations (“LES”) and scalable high-performance hardware.\nFor 3D-IC and multi-chiplet designs, our customers use the Cadence® Integrity™ 3D-IC Platform. Built on the Innovus solution, Integrity allows system-level designers to plan, implement, and analyze stacked die systems for a variety of packaging styles (2.5D or 3D). Integrity 3D-IC is the industry’s first integrated system and SoC-level solution that enables system analysis, including co-design, with Virtuoso and Allegro implementation environments. \nWe also offer molecular modeling and simulation solutions and services. These solutions and services are used by a wide range of organizations in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors to accelerate the drug discovery process and make more informed decisions in developing new therapeutics.\nProduct Arrangements\nWe primarily license our software using time-based licenses. Our time-based license arrangements offer customers the right to access and use all of the products delivered at the outset of an arrangement and updates throughout the entire term of the arrangement, which is generally two to three years, with no rights to return. In addition, certain time-based license arrangements include the right for the customer to remix among the products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and use unspecified additional products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement.\nA small portion of our software is licensed under perpetual licenses, which does not include the right to use new technology. Payment terms for time-based licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period, and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.\nOur hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers. Our emulation hardware can also be accessed remotely via a Cadence-managed cloud arrangement.\nWe generally license our design IP under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs. Some customers enter into non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. In addition, for certain IP license agreements, we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our IP to their customers.\nFor a further description of our license agreements, our hardware sale or lease agreements, revenue recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to the discussion under “Critical Accounting Estimates” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nTechnical Support and Maintenance\nCustomer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products. We provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software, hardware and IP solutions.\nOur education services offerings can be customized and include training programs that are delivered online, through an app, or in a classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from the latest design techniques to methodologies for using the most recent features of our products. The primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to productivity in the use of our products.\nServices\nWe offer a number of services, including design services, services related to methodology, education and hosted design solutions. These services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the license, sale or lease of our products. As necessary, specialized design services engineers are assigned to internal R&D projects associated with our design IP business. \nAs part of our services offerings, we design advanced ICs, develop custom IP and help customers address design challenges. This enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements. \nWe offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design capabilities, including low power design, IC packaging and board design, functional verification, digital implementation, analog/mixed-signal design and system-level design. The customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, mobile, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and life science vertical sectors. These ICs range from digital SoCs and analog and RF designs to complex mixed-signal ICs. \nThe Cadence Cloud portfolio, which consists of Cadence-managed and customer-managed cloud environments, continues to expand, with additional cloud-based and software as a service (“SaaS”) products, including cloud-based solutions for SD&A and functional verification. Contractual arrangements with customers for both environments are generally time-based, similar to the on-premises software license arrangements described above, and may include usage-based terms. \nIn delivering methodology services, we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques, our products, leading practices and different design environments to enable improved productivity of our customers’ engineering teams. Depending on the customers’ projects and needs, we work with customers using outsourced, consultative and collaborative offerings.\nThird-Party Programs and Initiatives\nIn addition to our products, many customers use design tools that are provided by other companies, as well as design IP available from alternative suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and design IP through our Cadence Connections® program and through our participation in industry groups such as the Silicon Integration Initiative and Accellera System Initiative. We actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards.\nProduct and Maintenance and Services Revenue\nRevenue, and revenue as a percentage of total revenue, from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\n2024                                                                                                               2023                                                2022\n                                                                                                                                          (In millions, except percentages)\nProduct and maintenance          $4,213                      91   %                  $3,834                      94   %                  $3,340                      94   %\nServices                            428                       9   %                     256                       6   %                     222                       6   %\nTotal revenue                    $4,641                                              $4,090                                              $3,562                            \nRecurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. Recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services. These arrangements do not meet the definition of a revenue contract until the customer executes a separate selection form to identify the products and services that they are purchasing. Each separate selection form under the arrangement is treated as an individual contract and accounted for based on the respective performance obligations.\nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by sales of hardware and individual IP licenses and certain software licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue is impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.\nFor additional information and analysis on our revenue, including revenue by geography, see the discussion under “Results of Operations” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For our fiscal 2024 results of operations and our financial position as of December 31, 2024, see Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We have elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, which included $0.5 billion of non-cancelable commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. \nWe estimate our remaining performance obligations at a point in time. Actual amounts and timing of revenue recognition may differ from these estimates largely due to changes in actual installation and delivery dates, as well as contract renewals, modifications and terminations. As of December 31, 2024, we expected to recognize 54% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancelable commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months, 42% over the next 13 to 36 months and the remainder thereafter.\nMarketing and Sales\nWe generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of salespeople and applications engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and post-sales support for our products. Due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring up to six months or longer. During the sales cycle, our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations, product demonstrations and support for on-site customer evaluation of our solutions. We also promote our products and services through advertising, marketing automation, trade shows, public relations and the internet. We selectively utilize value-added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. Our OrCAD products and certain Allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to international sales, we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in Japan.\nResearch and Development    \nOur future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. The primary areas of our R&D align with our product categories discussed above. We must continuously adapt our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs. We must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D.\nHardware Manufacturing and Software Distribution\nOur hardware, including all individual PCBs, custom ICs and FPGA-based prototyping components, is manufactured, assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers. Software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery. \nProprietary Technology\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Many of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third-party software and other IP in the future. As part of performing engineering services for customers, our engineering services business uses certain software and other IP licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to our business and operations. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations related to trade controls, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and data privacy and data protection and AI, as well as antitrust, competition, employment, income taxes and the environment. \nTrade\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions concerning the sale, shipment and transmission of our products and technology outside the United States and to foreign nationals, including tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, sanctions and other trade regulations. The Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce maintains and frequently adds entities to the “Entity List,” which limits our ability to deliver products and services to these entities, some of which are our customers. BIS has issued restrictions concerning advanced node IC production in China and other countries and extended controls to additional technologies, including electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of advanced node ICs, and issued export controls related to the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing, advanced computing, and supercomputer industries. These restrictions and any subsequent restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, either directly or by impacting our customers’ products, and restrict our ability to license or support our products to certain companies in China. Furthermore, increased restrictions on China exports may lead to regulatory retaliation by the Chinese government and possibly further escalate geopolitical tensions, and any such scenarios may adversely impact our business. The prospect of future export controls that are implemented in a similar manner may continue to have an ongoing impact on our business, results of operation, or financial conditions.\nTrade regulations limiting or banning sales into certain countries or to certain companies, including economic and financial sanctions and trade embargoes administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), have impacted our ability to transact business in certain countries and with certain customers. Future trade regulations may also impact our ability to transact business with certain customers and in certain countries and may restrict certain non-U.S. person employees from performing their duties at Cadence without first obtaining appropriate authorization if their duties involve an export, reexport, or transfer of export-controlled technology. \nAnti-corruption and anti-bribery\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials and bribes to other persons. \nData privacy and data protection \nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions governing data privacy and data protection, including the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation, which regulate our collection, handling and use of personal information.\nThe laws and regulations to which we are subject are complex and may change or develop over time, sometimes with limited or no advance notice. Developments or other changes in laws or regulations or how they are interpreted or enforced have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and increase our compliance-related expenditures. \n Artificial intelligence\nThe regulatory framework governing the use of AI, machine learning and automated decision-making technologies (“AI Technologies”) is rapidly evolving. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. \nAlready, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI Technologies, and new laws regulating AI Technologies have been enacted in China, the United States and the European Union. In the United States, the Trump administration has rescinded an executive order relating to AI Technologies that was previously implemented by the Biden administration and may continue to rescind other existing federal orders and/or administrative policies relating to AI Technologies, or may implement new executive orders and/or other rule-making relating to AI Technologies in the future. U.S. legislation is also advancing at the state level. For example, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently in the process of finalizing regulations under the California Consumer Privacy Act regarding the use of automated decision-making. The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”) applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and – depending on the AI use case - includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use and commercialize AI Technologies in the future.\nFor additional information regarding risks related to laws and regulations, including existing restrictions imposed by BIS, as well as international relations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nCompetition\nWe compete most frequently with Synopsys, Inc., Siemens EDA, and ANSYS, Inc., and also with numerous other tools providers, electronics device manufacturers with their own EDA capabilities, technical or computational software companies, electronics design and consulting companies and other IP companies. These include U.S. based companies such as Keysight Technologies, Inc., Schrödinger, Inc. and CEVA, Inc. and foreign companies such as Zuken Ltd. (Japan) and emerging competitors in China like Huada Empyrean, Xpeedic, X-EPIC, Primarius Technologies, Univista and Giga-DA. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions and/or have entered or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships which may alter their ability to compete with us.\nCertain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses. While we compete with other computational software companies in the engineering services business, our principal competitors in this area include independent engineering service businesses. Many of these companies are also customers, and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products.\nFor more information on risks related to competitive factors affecting our business, see the relevant discussions throughout Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital Resource Management\nOur people are at the center of our success and drive the innovations that are enabling next-generation technologies.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in the sections below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, revenue, growth, prospects, demand for our products and services, reputation and the trading price of our common stock, and make an investment in us speculative or risky. The following does not summarize all of the risks that we face, and there may be additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or not believed to be material that occur or become material.\nRisk Factors Summary \nBusiness and Operational Risks \n•We have experienced varied operating results, and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our hardware, IP and certain software products.\n•Uncertainty in the global economy and instability within international relations, including changes in governmental policies relating to technology, and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue.\n•We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in global markets as well as a variety of other laws and regulations.\n•As we continue to acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and these acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\n•We could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement or misappropriation of our IP rights by third parties.\n•Our success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology, as well as software and other IP rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such IP rights from third parties.\n•We may not realize opportunities presented by AI and may incur reputational and financial harm and liability as a result of issues in the development and use of AI.\n•Cyberattacks that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or our third-party providers’ information technology systems or confidential information could materially harm our business, reputation and financial condition.\n•Risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition.\n•The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue, expenses, cash flows and financial condition.\n•We depend upon our management team and qualified employees, and our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain them may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations.\n•A significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the United States, and if our cash available in the United States is insufficient to meet our requirements in the United States, we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\n•The investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\n•The long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.\n•We have incurred, and may in the future incur, substantial costs in connection with restructuring plans, which might not result in the benefits we anticipate, possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results.\n•Our business is subject to the risk of natural disasters and global climate change.\nRisks Related to Customers, Suppliers and Industry Competition\n•Customer consolidation could affect our operating results.\n•Our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements and to continue to develop or acquire technological capabilities could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete and impede our ability to address the requirements in technology segments that are expected to contribute to our growth.\n•Our investment in research and development of new and existing products, technologies and services may affect our operating results, and our return on investment may be lower or develop more slowly than expected.\n•Our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults, modifications or non-renewals of licenses.\n•The competition in our industries is substantial, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully.\n•Our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services.\n•We depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our hardware products, making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation.\nTax, Regulatory and Litigation Risks\n•Our results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of U.S. and foreign tax law changes, outcomes of current or future tax examinations, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates.\n•Litigation, government investigations or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\n•Errors, defects or other issues with our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business.\n•Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes.\n•If we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.\n•We are subject to evolving corporate governance, environmental and social practices and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness\n•Our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to fluctuations.\n•The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.\n•Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\n•Our bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders.\n•Our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.\n•At the option of the holders of our outstanding notes, we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase such notes.\n•The terms of our debt agreements restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\n•We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\n•Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\n•Various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital, including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to us and our New Notes by credit rating agencies.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe have experienced varied operating results, and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our hardware, IP and certain software products.\nHistorical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance. Various factors affect our operating results, and some of them are not within our control. Our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for our hardware, IP and certain software products for which revenue is recognized at a point in time rather than over time. In addition, we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future. Also, our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the timing of our billings, collections, disbursements and tax payments.\nA substantial portion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time, which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods and means that a decrease in orders in a given period would negatively affect our revenue in future periods.\nA substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware and IP, and to a lesser extent certain software, is recognized upon delivery, and our forecasted revenue results are based, in part, on our expectations of these products to be delivered in a particular quarter. Therefore, changes in bookings or deliveries for these products, relative to expectations, will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in the majority of our time-based software or services bookings, for which revenue is generally recognized over time.\nRevenue related to our hardware and IP products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and IP products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ICs and systems by our customers, our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or IP products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or IP products for delivery. Therefore, our hardware or IP sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply, delivery or installation of our hardware or IP products or our hardware suppliers. Moreover, the market environment for hardware and IP is highly competitive, and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or IP product based on cost, performance or other factors. These factors may result in lower revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. \nAs we continue to expand our IP offerings, a portion of the revenue related to our IP bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed IP to our customers. As a result, costs related to the research and development of IP may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue.\nWe plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue, expected business needs and other factors such as inflation. These expenses and the effect of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. Bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment. If we experience a shortfall in bookings, our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to short-term business changes. Our operating expenses are also impacted by economic conditions, such as inflation. Unexpected increases in inflation could cause our expenses to increase at a rate faster than our product pricing to recover such increases.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see “Critical Accounting Estimates” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). Such methods, estimates and judgments are subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nUncertainty in the global economy and instability within international relations, including changes in governmental policies relating to technology, and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue.\nPurchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor and electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.\nThe semiconductor and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products. The current outlook for the global economy is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on our products and services despite recent growth.\nUncertainty caused by challenging global political and economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, bank failures, U.S. deficit concerns, geopolitical conflicts and other adverse changes to international relationships among countries in which we or our customers operate or do business, protectionist measures or decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses, reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending, including their spending on our products and services, and as a result decrease demand for our products and services. Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other third parties, such as bank failures and failure by Congress to increase the U.S. federal debt ceiling on a timely basis, or concerns or speculation about any similar events or risks, have led and could lead to further credit downgrades and market-wide liquidity problems, which in turn may cause customers and other third parties to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements as well as general disruptions or instability in the financial markets. Public health emergencies and reactionary measures by governments and businesses have also had, and could in the future have, the effect of curtailing economic activity and causing substantial volatility and disruption in global markets. Decreased bookings for our products and services, customer bankruptcies, consolidation among our customers, or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenue and financial results. \nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain countries and within regions, that political, diplomatic or military events could result in trade disruptions and other disruptions in the markets and industries we serve and our supply chain. A significant disruption in any area where we or our customers operate or do business could reduce customer demand, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a negative impact on customer spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses, and our results of operations. For example, the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the United States and China, where we have derived a substantial percentage of our revenue, the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations, and geopolitical risks with respect to Taiwan, which serves as a central hub for the technology industry supply chain, could, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future business and financial results, including demand for our products and services, are subject to considerable uncertainties that could impact our stock price. If economic conditions or international relationships among countries in which we do business deteriorate, or, in particular, if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow, the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted, or our supplies of hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays, we may be adversely affected. Further, political or economic conflicts between various global actors, and responsive measures that have been or could be taken, have created and can further create significant global economic uncertainty that could prolong or expand such conflicts, which could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies and harm our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in global markets as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. \nWe must comply with the import and export restrictions and regulations and economic sanctions laws of the United States and of certain other countries in selling, providing or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the United States, to foreign nationals (including foreign nationals within the United States) or across borders. Changes in our products or services, or changes in and continued expansion of these laws and regulations, including new or increased tariffs, trade protection measures, sanctions, trade embargoes and other trade barriers, may create delays in the introduction of our products or services into international markets, prevent our customers from deploying our products or services or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products or services to certain countries, governments or persons altogether or result in increased costs for us, which could reduce our competitiveness, or for our customers, which could affect their purchasing behaviors. Any decreased use of our products or services or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products or services in international markets would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, BIS maintains and frequently adds entities to the “Entity List,” which limits our ability to deliver products and services to these entities, some of which are our customers. When customers are on the Entity List or are subject to new or expanded trade restrictions, it has a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers. In addition, the issuance of new or expanded trade restrictions, such as the continued expansion of the military end-user and military end-use rule, the foreign-direct product rules, or any other rule that prevents a class of commodities, software or technology from export to any specific country or countries without a license, could increase our costs or expenses. Anticipated or actual changes in trade restrictions could also affect customer purchasing behaviors. Entity List restrictions and other trade restrictions may also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors, including a growing class of foreign competitors and open source alternatives, that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness. In particular, China’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased competitive capability in China. In addition, although customers on the Entity List are not prohibited from paying (and we are not restricted from collecting) for products we previously delivered to them (in compliance with applicable law), the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the Entity List – including receivables from anti-piracy enforcement efforts and litigation settlements – and other trade restrictions could increase.\nWe cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these Entity List customers or other customers impacted by other trade restrictions. We are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer, technology, country or region or the long-term effects on our business or our customers’ businesses. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify, including that certain restrictions, even if not directly applicable to us, may impact our customers' products which may have an adverse effect on demand for our products, or that a country-specific export control may limit or prevent our employees who are nationals of the restricted country from performing their duties unless a license can be obtained. Additionally, our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the United States, China or other countries. For example, the United States and other global actors have imposed economic sanctions on Russia and other entities and individuals as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. New or increased tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, including new sanctions, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries.\nFailure to obtain import, export or re-export licenses or permits when required or restrictions on trade imposed by the United States or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the United States or across borders. In addition, if our customers sell our products to any entity on the Entity List without our knowledge or authorization, we may be held liable for such sales. Although we have implemented risk-based policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to comply with all applicable trade restrictions, we and governmental authorities have had and may in the future have reason to inquire into particular sales. Specifically, in February 2021, we received an administrative subpoena from BIS requesting the production of records in connection with certain sales to our customers in China. In November 2023, we received a related subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) that also requested information regarding our business activity in China. In December 2024, we began discussions with BIS and DOJ regarding preliminary findings of their investigations and a potential resolution of this matter. We have been and will continue cooperating with BIS and DOJ in responding to the subpoenas and their ongoing investigations. These matters are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes of these and other proceedings that may occur are difficult to predict. If any governmental fines, penalties, restrictions or compliance requirements are imposed on us, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, political, media or other scrutiny surrounding governmental investigations or their outcome could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal day-to-day operations.\nThe laws and policies of the United States and other countries in this area are evolving and changing, and we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in complying with new rules as they become effective. The application and interpretation of these laws and policies can also be uncertain and change over time, and we may need to adjust our policies and procedures accordingly. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and policies could have negative consequences, including significant legal costs, government investigations, penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition. \nIn addition to export control laws, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, tax, corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, competition, antitrust, data privacy, data protection and employment. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly, and changes to these laws, or their interpretations, may require us to make significant changes to our business operations that may adversely affect our business overall. The policies and procedures we have implemented to assist our compliance with these laws and regulations do not provide complete assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. Any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition. For more information about the import and export restrictions and regulations that we may be subject to, see “Governmental Regulations—Trade” under Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report.\nAs we continue to acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and these acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we invest in, and acquire complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and IP rights, some of which may be material to our financial condition and operating results. We continue to engage in investments and acquisitions and evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to find and identify desirable investment or acquisition targets, and we may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target.\nAcquisitions and other transactions, arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and potential operating difficulties and expenditures, including the following, any of which could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations:\n•    the failure to complete transactions on a timely basis or at all, or to realize, or a delay in realizing, anticipated benefits or synergies, including as a result of any conditions placed upon approvals from governmental authorities;\n•    potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired companies, technologies or products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate them;\n•    brand or reputational harm, including due to failure or perceived failure to achieve our publicly disclosed greenhouse gas emissions reduction target due to acquisitions with large greenhouse gas emissions;\n•    the failure to understand, compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n•    the failure to integrate, combine or manage acquired products, infrastructure, technologies and businesses effectively;\n•    difficulties in integrating and assimilating acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both acquired and existing employees and difficulties related to acquired employees represented by labor unions;\n•    the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n•    diversion of financial resources and management’s attention from day-to-day business;\n•    overlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates;\n•    unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those related to an acquired company's disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting, cybersecurity, taxes and other compliance programs;\n•    contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future;\n•    unwillingness of customers, suppliers or other business partners of an acquired business to continue licensing or do business with us, or delays in such activities;\n•    difficulties managing any strategic investment or collaboration that we do not control or for which we do not have sole decision-making authority;\n•    impairment charges or other adverse accounting outcomes related to acquisitions or strategic investments;\n•    the failure or cessation of operations by entities in which we made strategic investments or collaboration agreements;\n•    the loss of some or all of the value of our investment;\n•    additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations; and\n•    the tax effects of any such acquisitions including related integration and business operation changes, and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities\nIn addition, to facilitate acquisitions or investments, we have and may in the future seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, we have and may in the future finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity or convertible securities, or use such securities as consideration, which have and may in the future cause our existing stockholders to be diluted. We also have and may in the future finance acquisitions or investments through debt financing. Acquisitions or investments may also require the expenditure of substantial cash resources. Acquisitions are also often dilutive to margins and earnings, at least initially. In addition, in certain cases we may be required to consolidate one or more of our strategic investee’s financial results into ours. Fluctuations in any such investee’s financial results, due to general market conditions, bank failures or otherwise, could negatively affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the technology sector. The United States and several other countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, restrictions on transactions involving foreign investments. Antitrust authorities in the United States and a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with increased scrutiny. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions, investments or integrations of businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement or misappropriation of our IP rights by third parties.\nThere are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem. New patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by computational software companies as well as entities and individuals outside the computational software field, including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringement-related licensing and litigation. It is not always practicable or possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result, from time to time, we have been and may continue to be compelled to respond to IP infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights consistent with the terms of our license agreements.\nIP infringement and misappropriation claims, including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to third-party claims against our customers, regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays, all of which could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIP claims or litigation has compelled and could compel us to do one or more of the following:\n•pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods);\n•stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged IP and potentially refund customers;\n•obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms; or\n•redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or impossible.\nIf we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business, reputation and operating results might suffer.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology, as well as software and other IP rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such IP rights from third parties.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology and our ability to secure, protect and enforce our IP rights in our proprietary technology. We generally rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or licenses agreements with our employers, contractors, customers, business partners and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite the precautions we may take to protect our IP rights, from time to time third parties challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Our patents and other IP rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages. Patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect every feature of our technology. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill, and if we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the United States, and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our IP in foreign jurisdictions, particularly with respect to trade secret rights and including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships. The protection of our IP may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our IP may not adequately protect our rights, or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our IP rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our IP rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our IP rights, which could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our IP rights.\nMany of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other IP. Our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other IP owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. In addition, we use open source software in our products, and due to uncertainties regarding the interpretation of open source software licenses, there is a risk that our use of open source software is inconsistent with what the copyright owners had intended, which could lead to disputes and enforcement actions, including demands that we release applicable source code, and we may be forced to re-engineer our products or incur additional costs to replace the affected open source software. Our failure to obtain third party software, other IP licenses or other IP rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms (or at all), or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In the case of infringement or misappropriation caused by technology that we obtain from third parties, any indemnification or other contractual protections we obtain from such third parties, if any, may be insufficient to cover the liabilities we incur as a result of such infringement or misappropriation.\nWe may not realize opportunities presented by AI and may incur reputational and financial harm and liability as a result of issues in the development and use of AI.\nWe use AI Technologies throughout our business and are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including expanding our generative AI platform and applications, to enable our customers to optimize their products’ performance, increase the productivity of their design teams and workflows and develop AI solutions themselves. AI Technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies. Such other companies may develop AI Technologies that are similar or superior to ours and/or are more cost-effective and/or quicker to develop, deploy and maintain. Any inability to develop, offer or deploy new AI Technologies as effectively, as quickly and/or as cost-efficiently as our competitors could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results, customer relationships and growth. We expect that increased investment will be required in the future to continuously improve our development and use of AI Technologies. Moreover, the long-term trajectory of this technological trend is unknown, and we may not be successful in our ongoing development and maintenance of AI Technologies in the face of novel and evolving technical, reputational and market factors. We may incur significant costs, resources, investments, delays and not achieve a return on investment or capitalize on opportunities presented by AI, and we could incur financial losses. \nFurther, the introduction of AI Technologies into new or existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results. The regulatory framework governing the use of AI Technologies is rapidly evolving. Existing laws and regulations, such as data privacy and antitrust regimes, may apply to us or our customers in new ways, and many U.S. federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. For example, in May 2024, the European Union approved the EU AI Act establishing a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market, the breach of which could result in fines of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of AI Technologies, or could be rescinded or amended as new administrations take differing approaches to evolving AI Technologies. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards or market perception of their requirements may have on our business and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. \nWe cannot predict how newly instituted legislation and regulation, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, will impact our ability, or our customers' ability, to develop and offer products or services that leverage AI Technologies and the costs of doing so. We may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions if the laws, regulations or decisions are not consistent across jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws, could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI Technologies). Such an increase in operating expenses, as well as any actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the IP ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI Technologies have not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of AI Technologies into our products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other IP misappropriation. \nThe implementation of AI Technologies may accelerate or exacerbate potential risks related to technological developments. These risks include the possibility of AI Technologies malfunctioning, producing biased or inaccurate results or failing to meet performance expectations. The development and deployment of AI Technologies carries the risk of other unintended consequences, such as ethical concerns, privacy violations and negative public perception. The rapid evolution of AI Technologies requires the application of resources to help ensure that AI is implemented responsibly in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. If the development or use of AI Technologies by us or our customers draws controversy due to perceived or actual impact on human rights, IP, privacy, security, employment or the environment or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. For more information about laws and regulations governing the use of AI Technologies, see “Governmental Regulations—Artificial intelligence” under Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report.\nCyberattacks that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or our third-party providers' information technology systems or confidential information could materially harm our business, reputation and financial condition. \nWe rely on hardware, software, digital infrastructure and computing networks for both internal and customer-facing operations that are critical to our business (collectively, “IT Systems”). We own and manage certain IT Systems but also rely on third parties for IT Systems and related products and services, including cloud computing. In addition, we and certain third-party providers collect, maintain and process data about our customers, employees, business partners and others, including personally identifiable information, as well as proprietary data such as trade secrets (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). \nWe face numerous, evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems, Confidential Information, products and services, including from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and malicious insiders, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering (including phishing), malware (including ransomware) and denial-of-service attacks, and due to human or technological error, such as misconfigurations, “bugs” or other vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Additionally, advances in technology, an increased level of sophistication and expertise of hackers, widespread access to generative AI, and new discoveries in the field of cryptography can result in a compromise or breach of our IT Systems or security measures implemented to protect our systems. We have experienced cyberattacks and other security incidents in the past and will continue to experience varying degrees of attacks and incidents in the future. Any such incidents could compromise our IT Systems, which could cause system disruptions or slowdowns and lead to the information stored on our networks being accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any actual or perceived unauthorized access or disclosure to our Confidential Information poses significant risk to our business as it could result in reputational and financial harm and further subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others.\nCyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools – including AI – that circumvent security controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. A cyberattack on our IT Systems or IT Systems of one of our third-party providers or customers could result in any or all of the following: compromise to our Cadence Cloud portfolio, which includes both our managed and customer-managed environments, and our data centers and those of our customers and end users; corruption or stealing of Confidential Information such as proprietary information related to our (or our customers') business, products, services and infrastructure or personally identifiable information; manipulation or stealing of financial data and assets; and/or disruption of our systems and services and those of our customers and others. Because we make extensive use of third party suppliers and service providers, such as cloud services that support our internal and customer-facing operations, successful cyberattacks that disrupt or result in unauthorized access to third party providers’ IT Systems can materially impact our operations and financial results. Moreover, breaches of our security measures and vulnerabilities in our or third-party providers’ IT Systems or products or services may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse, loss of financial assets, business interruption, regulatory investigations, litigation and other potential liability. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management strategy, program, policies, processes and controls will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting any systems or information. \nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and include zero-day software vulnerabilities that are unknown until exploited by threat actors. As a result, we may be unable to promptly or effectively detect, investigate, remediate or recover from future attacks or incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact to our IT Systems, Confidential Information or business. Furthermore, we have acquired and continue to acquire companies with less sophisticated security measures, and it takes time to align their security practices to meet our information security policies, procedures and controls, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity, operational and financial risk. Furthermore, employees working from remote work environments can expose us to increased security risks and attacks. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other vulnerabilities and be susceptible to hacking or misappropriation. In addition, certain of our third-party vendors use cloud storage of information as part of their services and product offerings, creating risk of misappropriation of our Confidential Information by third parties. \nIn the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or a vendor's security, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers (including government customers), incur significant restoration, remediation and compliance costs, or suffer harm to our financial condition. The loss, misuse or theft of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us, vendors or other third parties in the course of running our business could result in business or financial harm, damage to our reputation and legal or regulatory proceedings. Also, we cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.\nRisks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations, a substantial majority of our employees are located outside of the United States, and we have offices throughout the world, including key research and development facilities outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n•trade restrictions, sanctions or other trade barriers, which may lengthen sales cycles, restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products, or prevent foreign nationals employed by us from performing their roles;\n•limitations on repatriation of earnings and on the conversion of foreign currencies;\n•reduced protection of IP rights and heightened exposure to IP theft; \n•longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n•difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n•political and economic conditions, such as economic downturns in the regions in which we do business, as well as macroeconomic policy and operational impacts of political instability and armed conflicts, including military service by our international employees;\n•changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n•differing employment practices and labor issues or inability to continue to offer competitive compensation; \n•variations in costs or expenses associated with our international operations, including as a result of changes in foreign tax laws or changes in valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies; and\n•public health emergencies and related public health measures, including restrictions on travel between jurisdictions in which we and our customers and suppliers operate. \nSome of our research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there is a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability, terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically. Damage to or disruptions at our research and development facilities could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to develop and improve products. We are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war, among other exclusions. Furthermore, our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations, such as cyber hacking, computer system viruses, natural disasters, public health emergencies, civil unrest or terrorism, could significantly harm our business operations.\nIn addition, internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations.\nThe effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue, expenses, cash flows and financial condition. \nApproximately one third of our total costs and expenses has historically been transacted in foreign currencies and more than a half of our revenue has historically come from our international operations, while the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars. Volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business, most notably the U.S. dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, European Union euro, British pound, Indian rupee, Taiwan dollar and Israeli shekel, have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results. \nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could seriously affect our business, operating results and financial condition, including due to inflation, devaluations and currency controls. If we price our products and services in a non-U.S. market in the local currency, we receive fewer U.S. dollars when the local currency declines in value relative to the U.S. dollar. If we price our products and services in a non-U.S. market in U.S. dollars, a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in that market. On the other hand, when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the U.S. dollar, it takes more U.S. dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency, which increases our operating expenses in that region. Our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful, and exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in U.S. dollars. For more information, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk.”\nWe depend upon our management team and qualified employees, and our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain them may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations.\nOur business depends upon the continued services, efforts and abilities of our senior management and other qualified employees. Competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers. In addition, competition for qualified personnel, including software engineers, in the EDA, commercial electronics engineering services and IP industries has intensified. Further, increased uncertainty regarding social, political and immigration policies in the United States and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience; and governmental policies resulting in increased funding of domestic technology companies, such as China’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030, has caused and may continue to cause difficulty in retaining and attracting local talent. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in training, retaining and motivating existing personnel. Our ability to do so also depends on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees, particularly as we transition employees back to the office generally four days a week, which may impact our ability to retain and hire employees. Additionally, hiring and training of new employees may be adversely impacted by global economic uncertainty. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers, and as a result, we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees, customers and suppliers may be adversely affected. \nTo attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results. The high cost of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results.\nA significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the United States, and if our cash available in the United States is insufficient to meet our requirements in the United States, we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States and significant operations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 34% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the United States. We cannot accurately predict the full impact that evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions may have on our cash flows. In addition, although the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) has reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings, there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the U.S. from non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, if our U.S. cash is insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the United States, we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our common stock.\nThe investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nOur marketable investments include various money market funds and shares of publicly held companies, and may include other investments as well. Weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit, liquidity, market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments. Additionally, changes in monetary policy by the Federal Open Market Committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising U.S. government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio. We also invest cash in non-marketable equity securities, including shares of privately held entities. The financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.\nGenerally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer. The complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities. In addition, sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers’ competitive evaluation processes or customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles. Long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results. In addition, if our customers build elevated inventory levels, we could experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand for our hardware products. Further, economic conditions, including economic downturn and rising inflation, may have a delayed impact on our results and financial condition as a result of our long sales cycles. Similarly, such macroeconomic conditions may impact our long sales cycles by making it difficult for our customers to plan future business activities, which could cause customers to limit spending or delay decision-making.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, substantial costs in connection with restructuring plans, which might not result in the benefits we anticipate, possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results. \nFrom time to time, we initiate restructuring plans in an effort to better align our resources with our business strategy. We incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses. Our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings or other benefits from any restructuring plans we implement in the future. In addition, restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Our competitors may also use any future restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. As a result, restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results.\nOur business is subject to the risk of natural disasters and global climate change.\nOur corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities, and a significant portion of our employees are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known to experience seismic activity and wildfires. Our offices around the world may also be adversely impacted by natural disasters, including those intensified by climate change. Our offices, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by droughts, extreme temperatures, fires, flooding and other climate change-related risks, as well as earthquakes, actions by utility providers and other catastrophic events such as an actual or threatened public health emergency. If a catastrophic event occurs at or near our offices or where our employees are located, or utility providers or public health officials take certain actions (e.g., shut off power to our facilities or impose travel restrictions), our operations may be interrupted, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. If a catastrophic event impacts a significant number of customers, resulting in decreased demand for their and our products, or our ability to provide services and maintenance, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. \nRisks Related to Customers, Suppliers and Industry Competition\nCustomer consolidation could affect our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships. As companies attempt to expand, strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations. If this trend continues, it could make us more dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased bargaining power in negotiations with us and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer. Customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations, reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions. These outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements and to continue to develop or acquire technological capabilities could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete and impede our ability to address the requirements in technology segments that are expected to contribute to our growth.\n Our strategy is designed to increase our business among electronic systems companies, which are developing their own ICs and other electronic subsystems, and to increase our business among semiconductor companies, which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ICs and other electronic subsystems are incorporated. Part of this strategy involves addressing the needs across a variety of vertical sectors including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and life sciences, where increased investment is expected by our customers. Each of these sectors require technologies, expertise, and marketing and operations infrastructure that are application-specific. Our inability to develop or acquire application-specific capabilities could impede our ability to expand our business and ultimately affect our future growth. The following trends may impact the sectors we serve:\n•changes in the design and manufacturing of ICs, including migration to advanced-process nodes, present major challenges to the semiconductor industry, particularly in IC design and verification, design automation, design of manufacturing equipment, and the manufacturing process itself. With migration to advanced-process nodes, the industry must adapt to more complex physics and manufacturing challenges. Novel design tools and methodologies must be invented and enhanced quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges;\n•with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of off-the-shelf design IP with custom logic to create ICs or SoCs. The unavailability of a broad range of high-quality design IP (including our own) that can be reliably incorporated into a customer’s design with our software products and services could lead to reduced demand for our products and services;\n•adoption of cloud computing technologies with accompanying new engagement models for an increasing number of software categories may impact our business;\n•with Moore's Law slowing, the trend towards more on-chip integration and advanced system level 3D package design may change the requirements for the design, multiphysics analysis and verification of complex systems; and\n•changing end-user dynamics in our target customer vertical sectors could advance the need from simple ICs to full-system design and analysis capabilities that require increasingly complex computational software-based solutions.\nIf we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends, we may lose our competitive position, and our products or technologies may become obsolete. To compete successfully, we must develop, acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments. We must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers’ industries. The market must also accept our new and improved products. We must also offer high-quality technical support services to assist our customers in planning, deploying and gaining operation proficiency for our products. We must enhance our hardware platforms periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer. Our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing. We must also be able to support a range of changing computer software, hardware platforms and customer preferences. Additionally, we must be able to identify and successfully enter emerging international markets for our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all, or any, of the customer trends.\nOur investment in research and development of new and existing products, technologies and services may affect our operating results, and our return on investment may be lower or develop more slowly than expected.\nWe invest and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products, technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements and to maintain and improve our competitive position. Such investments may be in related areas, such as technical sales support, and may include increases in employee headcount. These investments may involve significant time, risks and uncertainties, including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that we may not realize the intended benefits of these investments. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their computational software products and design flows, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults, modifications or non-renewals of licenses.\nOur customers have and may continue to face challenging financial or operating conditions, including due to macroeconomic conditions or catastrophic events, and delay or default on their payment commitments to us, request to modify contract terms, or modify or cancel plans to license our products. Our customers’ inability to fulfill payment commitments, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue, operating expenses and cash flow. Additionally, from time to time our customers seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments. Customers may also choose to not renew their licenses to our products in full or at all. Payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe competition in our industries is substantial, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully.\nThe industries in which we do business are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost-competitive products, integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner. Failure to compete successfully could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include:\n•the development by others of competitive products or platforms and services, possibly resulting in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decreased revenue;\n•aggressive pricing competition by our competitors, including through significant discounts, may cause us to reduce the prices of our products, offer terms that are unfavorable to us or lose our competitive position, any of which could result in lower revenue or profitability and could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our products and could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products;\n•the challenges of advanced-node design may lead some customers to work with more mature, less risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their EDA solutions and design flows;\n•the challenges of developing (or acquiring) technology solutions that meet the rapidly evolving requirements of next-generation design challenges;\n•intense competition to attract acquisition targets, possibly making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price, or at all;\n•new entrants, including larger electronic systems companies, in our industry;\n•the combination of our competitors or collaboration among competitors and/or other companies (including through strategic alliances) to deliver more comprehensive or different offerings than they could individually;\n•our entry into new product categories or technology vertical sectors, including those in which success depends on absolute or relative scale;\n•decisions by customers to perform engineering services or IP development internally, rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity; \n•actions by regulators to limit the contractual terms that either we or our customers can apply to product and service offerings; and \n•events or circumstances that damage the reputation of our company, leadership, products, services or technologies. \nFor more information about our specific competitors, see “Competition” under Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report.\nOur future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services.\nOur installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license, services and maintenance revenues. In future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance. Our customers, many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies, often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us.\nWe depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our hardware products, making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation.\nOur reliance on single or a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our hardware products has resulted in, and could continue to result in, some product delivery delays and reduced control over contractual terms and quality. In some cases, it may not be practical or feasible to have multiple sources to procure certain key components. We have suffered from, and may continue to suffer from, delays and other disruptions in the supply of certain hardware components and the delivery of products by our contract manufacturers. Such delays and disruptions may be due to a variety of factors, including bankruptcy, shutdown or upstream supply chain issues, and may prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers, which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. \nTax, Regulatory and Litigation Risks\nOur results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of U.S. and foreign tax law changes, outcomes of current or future tax examinations, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates.\nTax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic, political and other conditions. Governments, including the United States, are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, particularly from multinational corporations, which have led to changes in tax laws, an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities. We are currently subject to tax audits, administrative appeals and litigation in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions have assessed, or may assess, additional tax liabilities against us. \nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Hungary. Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business activity, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with low statutory tax rates, changes in tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our recognition or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, increases to interest or penalty expenses, new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards, or results of examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), state, and foreign tax or other governmental authorities. For example, our fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 effective tax rates and cash tax payments increased significantly as compared to fiscal 2021, which primarily resulted from a requirement that we capitalize and amortize R&D costs beginning from fiscal 2022, rather than expense these costs as incurred for U.S. corporate income tax purposes.\nThe IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other non-income tax returns, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth or franchise, property, goods and services, consumption, import, stamp and excise taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. However, the final outcome of tax examinations cannot be estimated with certainty and could be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes, penalties or interest as a result of a current or future examination, we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the applicable period or periods.\nIn August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included a new minimum tax on certain large corporations, an excise tax on stock buybacks and significant funding for IRS enforcement efforts. In October 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) announced an agreement among more than 130 countries to adopt new rules including Pillar Two Model Rules which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations, such as Cadence, at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. Furthermore, many countries have enacted or proposed new laws to tax digital transactions. These and future developments in tax laws and regulations, and related compliance, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nForecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes and are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating the amount and composition of our annual income or loss in jurisdictions with varying income tax rates, as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets, the impact of various accounting rules, our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits. In addition, we account for certain tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled, which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates. If there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nLitigation, government investigations or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nFrom time to time, we or our products or technologies are involved in or subject to disputes and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and legal proceedings related to IP, indemnification, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, customers, products, distribution and other commercial arrangements and employee relations matters. Governments and regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate also open or initiate inquiries, investigations or regulatory proceedings from time to time. For information regarding legal proceedings in which we are currently engaged, please refer to the discussion under Note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The final outcome of these legal proceedings or any other proceedings that may arise in the future could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Legal proceedings can be time consuming, expensive and divert management’s time and attention from our business, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nErrors, defects or other issues with our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business.\nOur customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work, including the interoperation of our products with third party products in a customer's environment, some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, from time to time, our customers or their end users discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design, or the products or systems incorporating our design and IP may not operate as expected. Errors, defects or issues arising from interoperability with third party products, whether or not our products are the source of such problems, could result in reputational damage, failure to attract new or retain existing customers or market share and acceptance, diversion of development resources to resolve the problem, loss of or delay in revenue or payments and increased service costs and liability.\nAlthough we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale, in some circumstances, we may be required to indemnify a customer in full, without limitation, for certain liabilities. Although we do not control what our products are used for and our standard terms and conditions generally disclaim liability for our customers’ products, the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not apply or may not fully cover claims asserted against us. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management’s time and other resources or cause reputational damage.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. We are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business. Changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under U.S. GAAP that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results. \nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts, accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles. The cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.\nIf we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.\nWhen companies in our industry lose employees to competitors, they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations.\nWe are subject to evolving corporate governance, environmental and social practices and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, Nasdaq and the FASB, as well as evolving investor, customer, employee and other stakeholder expectations around corporate governance, executive compensation and environmental and social practices and related disclosures. These rules, regulations and expectations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by U.S. and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. For example, in January 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to target diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the private sector, including directing each agency to identify up to nine opportune civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, and requiring agencies to include terms within federal contracts for contractors to certify that they do not operate such programs that violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws, among others. We may be subject to increased litigation and regulatory scrutiny regarding these practices. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us. We expect that rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations and expectations related to corporate governance, environmental and social matters, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, will continue to increase the cost of our compliance and internal risk management programs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, some stakeholders may disagree with our environmental, social and governance targets and practices and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders may have different views on where corporate governance, environmental and social focus should be placed. Any disagreement with our targets or strategies could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established environmental, social and governance targets and strategies, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. If our ESG practices, reporting or disclosure controls do not meet evolving investor, customer, employee or other stakeholder expectations and regulatory standards, or if we are unable to make progress on or achieve our goals and objectives, including our net zero target, then our reputation and our attractiveness as an employer, investment or business partner could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our disclosures and public positions or commitments on these matters may change from time to time, as may corresponding internal controls and external reporting standards, which can expose us to reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, including as a result of a failure or perceived failure to achieve aspirations, targets, or goals, such as our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, or a failure to report accurately. Statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change. In addition, we could face scrutiny from certain stakeholders for the scope or nature of such initiatives, targets or goals, or for any revisions to these initiatives, targets or goals.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be subject to fluctuations.\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and other factors beyond our control including macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business or security of our products, can cause changes in our stock price. In addition to these factors and industry and general economic and political conditions, our stock price may be adversely impacted by announcements related to financial results or forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with earlier projections or the expectations of our securities analysts or investors, announcements of new products or acquisitions of new technologies by us, or by other companies, including our competitors or our customers, or announcements of acquisitions, major transactions, litigation developments or management changes. A significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, stockholder derivative lawsuits or other actions by stockholders, which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.\nWe repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from our Board of Directors. The primary objective of our share repurchase activities is to prevent share dilution associated with our stock compensation plans. The actual timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors and may fluctuate based on such factors. Our repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire a minimum amount of shares, does not have an expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated without prior notice. We cannot guarantee that the authorization will be fully expended or that our share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Further, our share repurchase activities could affect our stock price, increase stock price volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) that apply to us could make it difficult for anyone to acquire control of our company. Our certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors to designate and issue, at any time and without stockholder approval, up to 400,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, all of which are currently designated as Series A Preferred, but the number of such shares of preferred stock may be reduced to zero. Subject to the DGCL, our Board of Directors may, as to any shares of preferred stock the terms of which have not then been designated, establish the terms without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue shares of Series A Preferred with dividend, voting and liquidation rights superior to our common stock at a rate of 1,000-to-1 without further vote or action by the common stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following: \n•our Board of Directors’ exclusive right to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by an expansion, resignation, death or removal; \n•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent in certain circumstances, forcing certain stockholder actions to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; \n•the requirement that a special meeting may be called only by our Board of Directors,the Board Chair, Chief Executive Officer or Secretary upon the written request of certain stockholders that satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws; \n•certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of outstanding voting stock(with different requirements for a related person); and \n•advance notice procedures required to nominate candidates or to propose matters for a stockholders’ meeting.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.\nAll or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our Board of Directors to resist, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders. \nOur bylaws provide that, unless a majority of our Board of Directors consents to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, subject to certain jurisdictional requirements, is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action based upon a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder to us or to our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders, arising pursuant to the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or our current or former directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, our bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.\nWe have significant outstanding indebtedness, as well as the ability to access additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.300% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the “New Notes”), we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, share repurchases or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. \nSpecifically, our level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n•making it more difficult for us to service our debt;\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows (including U.S. cash) to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources; \n•limiting our interest deductions for U.S. income tax purposes; and\n•increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the New Notes, then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company.\nAt the option of the holders of our outstanding notes, we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase such notes.\nUnder the terms of the New Notes, we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their respective maturity dates in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events. Specifically, we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” (as defined in the indenture related to such notes), such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes. The repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the New Notes prior to their respective maturity dates, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nThe terms of our debt agreements restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our New Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur liens or additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, alter the businesses we conduct, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the agreement governing our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio. Our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet it.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and the New Notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. \nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities or otherwise grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our debt obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our debt obligations. Our debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise capital to repay other indebtedness when due. We may not be able to consummate dispositions or obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt obligations when due. \nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to us. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. If we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our debt.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders could terminate their commitments to loan money, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using short form, automatically effective registration statements, potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, could correspondingly decrease. We may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, the applicable margin is based on the credit rating of our unsecured debt. Accordingly, a credit rating downgrade would increase the applicable interest rate. Assuming our revolving credit facility was fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, each quarter point change in the interest rate would result in a $4.4 million change in annual interest expense.\nVarious factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital, including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to us and our New Notes by credit rating agencies.\nWe may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons, and our future borrowing costs, terms and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets, the condition of the economy generally, prevailing interest rates, our level of indebtedness, our credit rating and our business and financial condition. In addition, the New Notes currently have an investment grade credit rating, which could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency based on adverse changes to circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the New Notes. Any future lowering of the credit ratings of the New Notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.",
