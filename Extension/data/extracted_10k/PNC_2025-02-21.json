      "text": "ITEM 1 – BUSINESS\nBusiness Overview\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the U.S. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. At December 31, 2024, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were $560.0 billion, $426.7 billion and $54.4 billion, respectively.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through organic growth, strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries. We offer a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based products and services to serve our customers. See Note 22 Segment Reporting for additional details regarding our products and services. \nSignature Bank Portfolio Acquisition\nOn October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately $16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition. \nSubsidiaries\nOur corporate legal structure at December 31, 2024 consisted of one domestic subsidiary bank, including its subsidiaries, and 53 active non-bank subsidiaries, in addition to various affordable housing investments and historic rehabilitation investments. Our bank subsidiary is PNC Bank, a national bank chartered in Wilmington, Delaware. For additional information on certain of our subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 to this Report.\nSupervision and Regulation\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC registered under the BHC Act and a financial holding company under the GLB Act. PNC primarily conducts its business through its domestic bank subsidiary, PNC Bank, a national banking association chartered and located in Wilmington, Delaware.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, or other applicable laws or regulations, can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions. See the additional information included \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nas Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the impact of the regulatory environment on us and the financial services industry.\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by many regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the Board of Directors, the effectiveness of internal controls and internal audit function, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.\nThe results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among other things, that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable law or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions against a regulated entity, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public company and by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our businesses with operations outside the U.S. also are subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business.\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and certain of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses, assets or deposits, expand our operations geographically or reconfigure existing operations.\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus are compliance with the BSA/AML laws, capital and liquidity management (including contingency, recovery, and resolution planning), the structure and effectiveness of enterprise risk management frameworks, the protection of confidential customer information, cybersecurity, the oversight of arrangements with third-party vendors and suppliers, providing fair access to financial services to customers and potential customers, and compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing retail sales practices, fee disclosures, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, collection practices and protections for military service members.\nNew legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal financial regulators, other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the operations and profitability of our businesses. Given the new presidential administration, we anticipate new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. These initiatives may include, for example, the rescission or re-proposal of regulations, policies, and guidance issued under the prior administration, and could also affect the agencies’ approach to ongoing federal court litigation involving regulations issued under the prior administration. Whether and how these developments may impact the rules and policies applicable to us remains unclear at this point. The more detailed description of the significant regulations to which we are subject included in this Report is based on current laws and regulations and is subject to potentially material change. For additional information on the impact of the regulatory environment on us and the financial services industry, see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report.\nThe profitability of our businesses also is affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors in general, including laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation, electronic commerce, data security and privacy.\nThere are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws, regulations and policies that apply to us. To a substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and supervision of financial services institutions and their holding companies is not to protect our shareholders and our non-customer creditors, but rather to protect our customers (including depositors), the financial markets and financial system in general.\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nBanking Regulation and Supervision\nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The foundation of the agencies’ regulatory capital rules is the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee, the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions. The regulatory capital rules establish minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, referred to as risk-based capital requirements, as well as for the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and other exposures, referred to as leverage capital requirements. The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone significant change since 2013, when the agencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel Committee’s international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel III”, as well as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. On July 27, 2023, and as described in more detail below, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC proposed for public comment an interagency rule to implement the final components of the Basel III framework that would significantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank.\nThe federal banking agencies currently tailor the application of their capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential requirements for banking organizations to the asset size and risk profile (as measured by certain regulatory metrics) of the banking organization. The agencies’ capital and liquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or more in total assets into one of four categories (Category I, Category II, Category III and Category IV), with the most stringent capital and liquidity requirements applying to Category I firms and the least restrictive requirements applying to Category IV firms. The classification of any bank subsidiary of a BHC generally follows that of its parent BHC. PNC and PNC Bank currently are Category III firms because PNC (i) has more than $250 billion, but less than $700 billion, in consolidated total assets, (ii) is not designated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity. Under current rules, if any of these items were no longer the case, PNC and PNC Bank would become a Category I or II institution, and subject to more stringent capital and liquidity standards. As of December 31, 2024, PNC had cross-jurisdictional activities for these purposes of $24.0 billion. Some of the benefits of tailored application of capital, liquidity, and enhanced prudential requirements under current rules may be reversed if the agencies adopt, as proposed, certain rules issued in 2023 for comment as described further below. \nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide regulatory capital into three components: CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is generally common stock, retained earnings, and qualifying minority interests less required deductions. As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available-for-sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less required deductions. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated debt and, subject to certain quantitative limits, ACL, less any required deductions from Tier 2 capital. The regulatory capital rules limit the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries may be included in regulatory capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nUnder the current regulatory capital rules, PNC and PNC Bank must deduct investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets (in each case, net of associated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1 capital to the extent such categories individually exceed 25% of the institution’s adjusted CET1 capital. As of December 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank’s investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets did not exceed this threshold.\nThe agencies’ capital rules permit banking organizations that were subject to CECL during 2020 to delay CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital. PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for more detail on CECL and the ACL.\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios. The standardized approach for risk-weighted assets takes into account credit and market risk. To calculate risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach for credit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are generally multiplied by risk weights set forth in the rules, with the risk weights increasing as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset or exposure increases. For certain types of exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the exposure. High volatility commercial real estate, past due, and equity exposures, as well as MSRs and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. Under the market risk capital rule, risk-weighted asset amounts for covered trading positions are determined based on the calculation of VaR (including stressed VaR), specific risk, incremental risk and comprehensive risk amounts, as specified in the capital rules.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated using the definition of capital under the agencies’ Basel III capital rules and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted assets, as our Basel III regulatory capital ratios.\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain minimum standards for the capital ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank. Banking organizations must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets, to be considered “adequately capitalized.” BHCs subject to the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process, such as PNC, are subject to a CET1 SCB. The SCB is calculated based on the difference between a firm’s starting and minimum CET1 ratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in the supervisory severely adverse scenario during the CCAR process, plus four quarters of the organization’s planned common stock dividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%. Based on PNC’s performance under the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests as part of CCAR 2024, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. While PNC Bank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based capital above the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case of PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the case of PNC Bank) in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including paying dividends and executing repurchases or redemptions of any Tier 1 capital instrument, such as common and qualifying preferred stock, and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. As a result, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments, PNC and PNC Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 10.5%. In addition, while a firm’s SCB is typically determined as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has the right to conduct supervisory stress tests, require a firm to submit a revised capital plan and calculate a firm’s SCB more frequently. BHCs subject to a SCB, such as PNC, generally may increase their capital distributions without seeking prior Federal Reserve approval, provided the BHC otherwise complies with its SCB and any other applicable capital or capital distribution requirements. \nFor Category III banking organizations (such as PNC and PNC Bank), the Federal Reserve and OCC can supplement these higher SCB or capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This buffer, which must be held in the form of CET1 capital, is currently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal Reserve policy statement establishes the framework and factors the Federal Reserve would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer. Covered banking organizations would generally have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve establishes an earlier effective date.\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio, and require Category III banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total leverage exposure, referred to as the supplementary leverage ratio. Total leverage exposure takes into account on-balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category III banking organizations must maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. As of December 31, 2024, the leverage and supplementary leverage ratios of PNC and PNC Bank were above the required minimum level.\nPNC and PNC Bank are not currently subject to the additional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum long-term debt requirement, minimum total loss-absorbing capacity or enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirements that apply to U.S. GSIBs. However, it is possible that the agencies may apply one or more of these requirements in the future to additional BHCs or insured depository institutions like PNC and PNC Bank. In August 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed rules that would require Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies and banks to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt that satisfy certain requirements. Additionally, Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies would be subject to “clean holding company” requirements, which would prohibit such companies from entering into certain financial arrangements and cap certain liabilities. PNC, as a Category III holding company, and PNC Bank would be subject to the proposed rules and would have a three-year phase-in period after any final rule to achieve compliance with the long-term debt requirements. If the long-term debt rules were finalized in their current form, we would expect to achieve compliance through normal course funding. \nFailure to meet applicable capital requirements could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal banking agencies, including limitations on capital distributions, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The thresholds at which an insured depository institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” are based on (i) the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios; (ii) the institution’s leverage ratio; \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nand (iii) for the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized,” the institution’s supplementary leverage ratio (if applicable). Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers. Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification. For example, PNC and PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized” for PNC to continue to take advantage of financial holding company status as described below.\nAt December 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, including the levels of capital required to be considered “well capitalized,” see the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report and Note 19 Regulatory Matters.\nThe federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule in July 2023 to implement the final components of the Basel III framework. The rule generally would align the regulatory capital elements and required deductions for Category III banking organizations, such as PNC and PNC Bank, with those currently applicable to Category I and II banking organizations and apply a new expanded risk-based approach for calculating risk-weighted assets (the “expanded risk-based approach”). Among other impacts, PNC and PNC Bank would be required to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital and deduct from CET1 capital, among other items, MSRs, deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceed 10% of CET1 capital or in the aggregate with other threshold items that exceed 15% of CET1 capital. The new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular and standardized risk-weighting methodologies for credit, operational, market, equity and credit valuation adjustment risks. PNC and PNC Bank would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under the existing standardized approach and the expanded risk-based approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for their risk-based capital minimum and buffer requirements, including the SCB. The proposal included a proposed effective date for the final rule of July 1, 2025, with certain provisions having a three-year phase-in period, including the recognition of AOCI elements in regulatory capital and the increase in risk-weighted assets due to the expanded risk-based approach. Based on our December 31, 2024 balance sheet, PNC and PNC Bank expect to remain above the current minimum capital and buffer requirements if the proposal were finalized in its current form. In light of the change in the presidential administration, it is unclear whether the banking agencies will pursue the proposal or issue a revised proposal for comment. In any event, any rule is unlikely to be finalized and become effective by July 1, 2025.\nIn addition to regulatory capital requirements, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, capital stress testing requirements and CCAR process, as well as the DFAST requirements of the Federal Reserve and the OCC. \nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital planning process of BHCs, including PNC, that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For us, this capital planning assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve that describes the Company’s planned capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, engage in common stock repurchase programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments during a nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must resubmit a new capital plan prior to the next annual submission date if, among other things, there has been or will be a material change in the BHC’s risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. \nIn evaluating PNC’s capital plan, the Federal Reserve also considers a number of qualitative factors. In assessing a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC has sound and effective governance to oversee these processes. The Federal Reserve’s evaluation focuses on whether a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a strong risk management framework to identify, measure and assess material risks and that provides a strong foundation to capital planning. The Federal Reserve also considers the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s control framework and evaluates a BHC’s policy guidelines for capital planning and assessing capital adequacy. A BHC’s stress testing scenario design processes and approaches for estimating the impact of stress on its capital position, including stress testing models and non-model qualitative approaches, may be reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of appropriately stressful conditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital position. Significant deficiencies in a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes may result in supervisory directives that require the firm to address the identified deficiencies and, potentially, a downgrade in the BHC’s supervisory capital positions and planning rating.\nIn connection with the 2025 CCAR exercise, we must file our capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of December 31, 2024, with the Federal Reserve by April 7, 2025. In June 2025, we expect to receive PNC’s preliminary SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2025. The Federal Reserve must provide firms their final SCB for this period by August 31, 2025, which would reflect any changes made to the firm’s planned common stock dividends to remain in compliance with the firm’s SCB.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nAs a Category III institution, PNC must conduct a company-run DFAST stress test in even numbered years and release PNC’s projections of certain revenue, loss and capital results from the exercise under the agencies’ hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macroeconomic scenario and applying the agencies’ DFAST capital action assumptions.\nAs part of the DFAST and annual CCAR processes, the Federal Reserve releases certain revenue, loss and capital results for each participating firm from its supervisory stress testing exercises. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that it will soon seek public comment on significant changes to improve the transparency of its bank stress tests and reduce the volatility of resulting capital buffer requirements, and several trade associations filed suit in federal district court to obtain changes to various CCAR and stress testing processes. It is unclear what, if any, changes to the CCAR and stress testing process may result from this expected rulemaking and ongoing litigation. \nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity Risk Management Requirements. The Basel Committee’s Basel III framework also includes short-term liquidity standards and long-term funding standards, the LCR and NSFR, respectively.\nThe U.S. banking agencies’ LCR rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high-quality liquid assets to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions prescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A company’s LCR is the amount of its high-quality liquid assets divided by its net cash outflows, expressed as a percentage, and as calculated under the rules. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered banking organizations are required to maintain is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either institution’s LCR is below the minimum requirement for three consecutive business days, the institution must promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum LCR requirement.\nThe NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. A covered BHC’s NSFR is the ratio of its available stable funding to its required stable funding amount (as calculated under the rules) over a one-year horizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all covered banking organizations (expressed as a percentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily. If either institution’s NSFR falls, or is likely to fall below, the minimum requirement, the institution must provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum NSFR requirement.\nAs Category III institutions with less than $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to reduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each company’s LCR net cash outflows and NSFR required stable funding (as calculated under the rules) reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of high-quality liquid assets or available stable funding each institution must hold to meet the LCR and NSFR minimum requirements, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, PNC had weighted short-term wholesale funding for these purposes of $43.7 billion. \nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including PNC, to publicly disclose certain quantitative and qualitative measures of their LCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These disclosures include major components used to calculate the LCR and NSFR (e.g., high-quality liquid assets, cash outflows and inflows for the LCR, and available stable funding and required stable funding for the NSFR, at the consolidated parent company), and a qualitative discussion of the BHC’s LCR and NSFR results, including, among other things, key drivers of the results, composition of high-quality liquid assets and available stable funding, and concentration of funding sources. \nAdditionally, as a Category III institution, PNC also must, among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows under the BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements.\nFor additional discussion of regulatory liquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends and other capital distributions from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC Bank also is subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 19 Regulatory Matters. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity is also available in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Dodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve jointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the FDIC to implement this source of strength requirement. These joint rules have not yet been proposed. Consistent with this source of strength policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a BHC generally should \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nnot maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the CCAR exercise, such as PNC as discussed above, the Federal Reserve has expected capital plans to reflect conservative dividend payout ratios. \nEnhanced Prudential Requirements. Under Federal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more are subject to various enhanced prudential standards related to liquidity risk management and overall risk management. For PNC, these rules, among other things, establish liquidity stress testing requirements (discussed above), limitations on PNC’s aggregate net credit exposures to any single, unaffiliated company (referred to as SCCL), and certain oversight and governance responsibilities for PNC’s Chief Risk Officer, the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the Federal Reserve’s SCCL rules, PNC’s aggregate net credit exposure (including exposure resulting from, among other transactions, extensions of credit, repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, investments in securities and derivative transactions) to any unaffiliated counterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC’s Tier 1 capital. \nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large BHCs in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act. The GLB Act permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with companies engaging in, a broader range of financial activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies, insurance agents and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company in 2000. A BHC qualifies to become a financial holding company if the BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and its subsidiary depository institutions have a rating under the CRA of “Satisfactory” or better. Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial activities, and we generally are permitted to acquire non-bank financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve (other than insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities and merchant banking). In order to establish a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and the national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must have a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” or better.\nIf a financial holding company or a national bank with a financial subsidiary fails to continue to meet the applicable “well capitalized” or “well managed” criteria, the financial holding company or national bank must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among other things, identifies how the capital or management deficiencies will be corrected. Until such deficiencies are corrected, the relevant agency may impose limits or conditions on the activities of the company or bank, and the company or bank may not engage in, or acquire a company engaged in, the types of expanded activities only permissible for a financial holding company or financial subsidiary without prior approval of the relevant agency.\nIn addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new activity, if any of its insured depository institutions receives a CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory.” A national bank’s financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new financial activity, if the national bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory.” The CRA and its implementing regulations require the agencies to assess a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of the communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. At December 31, 2024, PNC Bank had a rating of “Outstanding” with respect to the CRA. On October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to amend the regulations implementing the CRA. The rule significantly expands the number of areas in which a bank is evaluated, materially changes the tests used to evaluate the bank in those areas and expands the data a bank must collect and report. In March 2024, before the final rule became effective, a federal court enjoined the federal banking agencies from enforcing the rule in its entirety, extending the effective date (originally set as April 1, 2024) and implementation dates by a day for each day that the injunction remains in place. If the final rule becomes effective, we expect the rule will increase PNC Bank’s obligations and compliance costs necessary to achieve a “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding” rating under the CRA.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nVolcker Rule. The Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in short-term trading as principal and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds, private equity funds, and certain other private funds (together, “covered funds”), unless an exemption or exception applies. For example, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule allow banking entities to trade as principal for securities underwriting, market making and risk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a variety of conditions. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to simplified and tailored compliance program requirements because each entity has trading assets and liabilities of less than $20 billion.\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate based on the actions, operations or risk management programs of a BHC, an insured depository institution or their subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have the ability to take enforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively, to prevent and remedy acts and practices that the agencies determine to be unfair or deceptive. A finding that we have engaged in a deceptive act or practice may have collateral consequences on our ability to rely on certain exemptions in, or take advantage of certain provisions of, the securities laws absent a government waiver of such restrictions.\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination ratings, lower capital or liquidity ratios than peer group institutions, or regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, make capital distributions or continue to conduct existing activities. Furthermore, the OCC has established certain heightened risk management and governance standards for large national banks, including PNC Bank. The guidelines, among other things, establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework, describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and provide that a covered bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework. If the OCC determines that a covered national bank is not in compliance with these or other enforceable guidelines (including guidelines relating to information security standards), the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation, Regulation W, place quantitative and qualitative restrictions on covered transactions between a bank and its affiliates (for example between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, on the other hand). In general, Section 23A and Regulation W limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single affiliate to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and all its affiliates to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing low-quality assets from an affiliate and require certain covered transactions to be secured with prescribed amounts of collateral. Covered transactions include, among other things, extensions of credit, guarantees and purchases of assets. Section 23B generally requires that transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms that are at least as favorable to the bank as the terms that would apply in comparable transactions between the bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative transaction with the affiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to propose rules to implement these revisions.\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations also place quantitative limitations and conditions on extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders and their related interests (including any company controlled by such persons). Generally, extensions of credit by a bank to such individuals, companies and related interests must comply with certain individual and aggregate lending limits, as well as procedural and qualitative requirements. As a result of the amount of PNC common stock held by its advised mutual funds and other accounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a principal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes of these regulations. The federal banking agencies have issued an interagency statement addressing the application of these insider lending restrictions to the other portfolio companies owned or controlled by the advised funds and accounts of a fund complex that could be considered a principal shareholder of a bank. The statement, which is currently in force until December 31, 2025, explains that the federal banking agencies will continue to exercise discretion to not take enforcement action against either a fund complex that is a principal shareholder of a bank, or a bank for which a fund complex is a principal shareholder, with respect to extensions of credit by the bank to the related interests of such fund complex that otherwise would violate the insider lending restrictions, subject to certain conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve is required to establish standards under a statutory provision known as the “Durbin Amendment” for assessing whether the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer such as PNC Bank is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer, subject to certain adjustments. The Federal Reserve implemented these standards through Regulation II, which limits the interchange fee an issuer may charge based on three components. On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the three components of the interchange fee cap. We expect the proposed rule, if finalized in its current form, would reduce PNC Bank’s interchange fee revenue.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance regarding incentive and other elements of compensation provided to executives and other employees at banking organizations they regulate, both as general industry-wide guidance and guidance specific \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nto select larger companies, including PNC. This guidance is intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of covered banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC and two other regulatory agencies to adopt regulations governing incentive compensation provided by regulated financial services companies to their executives and other employees. These agencies jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement these requirements. Final regulations have not been adopted. \nThe trust, investment advisory and other fiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank also are subject to the OCC’s regulations governing the fiduciary activities of national banks, as well as applicable state fiduciary laws. The OCC’s regulations, among other things, set standards for the administration of fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern potential conflicts of interests and establish recordkeeping requirements for fiduciary accounts. \nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC. In reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC, the factors the Federal Reserve must consider include (i) the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; (ii) the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; (iii) the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S.; (iv) the organizations’ compliance with AML laws and regulations; (v) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and (vi) the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. \nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval also is required, and similar factors are considered, for a BHC to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a savings association or savings and loan holding company, or to merge or consolidate with a savings and loan holding company. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. A BHC is generally prohibited from merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company or bank if upon consummation the resulting company would control 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or a state, or if the resulting company’s liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). In extraordinary cases, the FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, could order the break-up of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire another insured bank or savings association by merger or to acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve in connection with the acquisition of a bank or BHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is required to merge a non-bank entity into PNC Bank. \nThe Federal Reserve also has issued rules governing when a BHC is presumed to “control” another company for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby causing the company to be considered a subsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The rules establish a set of presumptions identifying when a BHC would be deemed to control another company, with the nature and scope of relationships a BHC may have with a non-controlled company (e.g., director or officer representatives, scope of business relationships, etc.) declining as the BHC’s voting ownership percentage in the company increases. \nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters. Deposits held by PNC Bank are insured by the FDIC, subject to certain limits, and subject to deposit premium assessments. PNC Bank, as an insured depository institution with over $50 billion in assets and controlled by a BHC with over $500 billion in assets on a consolidated basis, is a “highly complex institution” under the FDIC’s methodology for determining premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher deposit premiums would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary federal banking regulator through its examination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered deposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.\nFollowing the bank failures in March 2023, the FDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to certain resolution-related and Deposit Insurance Fund restrictions in order to fully protect all depositors of the affected institutions, including uninsured deposits. By law, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception must be recovered by one or more special assessments on insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, or both. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to implement the special assessment. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect from PNC, along with other BHCs and insured depository institutions, special assessments at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an institution’s uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the first quarter of 2024. Because the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from the systemic risk exception are \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nestimated, the FDIC periodically adjusts the estimate, which could result in extending the special assessment for additional quarters, imposing a final special assessment on a one-time basis if actual losses exceed the amounts collected, or cease collection early if the FDIC has collected enough to recover actual losses. PNC incurred noninterest expenses related to the special assessment of $515 million on a pre-tax basis during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The fourth quarter of 2024 included an $18 million pre-tax reduction of the FDIC special assessment.\nFederal banking laws and regulations also apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, brokered deposits are generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR. The FDIC has issued rules and guidance for determining whether deposits are considered “brokered.” \nResolution and Recovery Planning. BHCs that have $100 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, are required under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan (including a public summary) that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. PNC generally must file a resolution plan with the Federal Reserve and FDIC at least once each three-year period, with submissions alternating between a full plan and a plan targeted on certain areas or subjects identified by the agencies. The agencies, however, have reserved the ability to alter the scheduled filing date for a covered company, request an interim update before a covered company’s next scheduled filing date and require a covered company to submit a full resolution plan in lieu of a scheduled targeted plan. PNC filed a targeted resolution plan in December 2021 and received feedback from the agencies in December 2022 that did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in PNC’s plan. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized new guidance for holding company resolution plans submitted by domestic triennial full filers, such as PNC, under the Dodd-Frank Act. The guidance bifurcates each area of requirements into separate sections for single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, generally applying—to the extent relevant to each resolution strategy—the expectations from the 2019 resolution plan guidance applicable to U.S. GSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of entry resolution strategy will be required to incorporate more severe plan assumptions and include new required plan content, operational capabilities, and legal entity rationalization, among other requirements. PNC’s next 165(d) resolution plan is due October 1, 2025, per an extension provided by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in finalizing the new guidance. \nThe FDIC also requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan (including a public summary) to the FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. PNC Bank filed its last resolution plan in December 2022. Under a final rule issued by the FDIC in June 2024, most banks with $100 billion or more in assets, including PNC Bank, are required to submit full resolution plans on a three-year cycle, with interim informational supplements due in off-years. The FDIC may also engage in capabilities testing between full resolution plan submissions. The final rule significantly expands the required content elements and adds virtual data room and valuation capabilities as significant components of the resolution planning process. PNC Bank’s initial interim supplement is due on or before July 1, 2025, and PNC Bank’s next full resolution plan will be due on or before July 1, 2026.\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning. These guidelines require a covered bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that is evaluated and updated annually that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability should identified triggering events occur. The recovery plan guidelines are enforceable in the same manner as the other guidelines the OCC has established. In October 2024, the OCC finalized revisions to its recovery planning guidelines. The final guidelines incorporate an annual testing requirement into recovery plans and will require covered banks to consider both financial risks and non-financial risks—including operational and strategic risks—in their recovery plans. The guidance is effective as of January 1, 2025, except that covered banks, like PNC Bank, should be in compliance with the amended provisions addressing non-financial risk by January 1, 2026, and with the testing provisions by June 30, 2026. \nCFPB Regulation and Supervision. The CFPB is authorized to examine PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, mortgage, automobile, student and other consumer loans, and other consumer financial products and services that we offer. The consumer financial protection laws that are subject to the CFPB’s supervision and enforcement powers include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nThe CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service.\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by PNC or PNC Bank. The CFPB has engaged in rulemakings that affect, among other things, credit card late fees, overdraft fees, data collection and reporting requirements for small business lenders such as PNC Bank, and personal financial data rights. In early February 2025, the Acting Director of the CFPB instructed CFPB staff to, among other things, cease supervision and examination activities, pause pending investigation and enforcement actions, and not approve or issue any proposed or final rules. At this time, it is unclear how long these instructions will stay in force, either fully or partially.\nSecurities and Derivatives Regulation\nPNC, as a public company, is subject to the Exchange Act’s reporting requirements and related regulations and must file certain reports with the SEC on an ongoing basis. Our registered broker-dealers and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These rules, for example, require that broker-dealers and investment advisers act in a customer’s best interest when making investment recommendations to retail customers, which includes managing conflicts of interest, providing required disclosures and exercising a duty of care in making investment recommendations. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nThe CFTC regulates swap dealers, other than security-based swap dealers, which are regulated by the SEC. PNC Bank is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap dealing activities, PNC Bank has not registered (and currently does not intend, and is not required, to register) with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\nPNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses are subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. The CFTC’s regulations are intended to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives and foreign exchange markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protections to customers and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, these regulations (i) require that, absent certain specified exemptions, most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and be traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC Bank to comprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory reporting and real-time public reporting requirements; (iii) subject PNC Bank to various business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; and (iv) impose special duties on PNC Bank when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment). Because PNC Bank is a prudentially regulated swap dealer, PNC Bank is subject to the OCC’s capital requirements and margin requirements on certain swaps that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house.\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to PNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC swap dealer, impose compliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). In addition, failure to comply with the “pay-to-play” regulations that govern our swap and municipal securities businesses could result in limitations on PNC Bank’s ability to conduct swap and municipal securities business with state or local governments and their authorities.\nRegulations of Other Agencies\nIn addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to certain financial products and services we offer. For example, certain of our fiduciary, brokerage and investment management activities are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor under ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nCompetition\nWe are subject to intense competition from other regulated banking organizations, as well as various other types of financial institutions and non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.\nOur businesses compete to attract and retain deposits and/or to originate loans with:\n•Other commercial banks,\n•Savings banks,\n•Credit unions,\n•Consumer finance companies,\n•Leasing companies,\n•Investment management firms,\n•Other non-bank lenders,\n•Financial technology companies,\n•Treasury management service companies,\n•Insurance companies, and\n•Issuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.\nIn providing asset management services, our businesses compete with:\n•Investment management firms,\n•Large banks and other financial institutions,\n•Brokerage firms,\n•Financial technology companies,\n•Mutual fund complexes, and\n•Insurance companies.\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in investment banking and alternative investment activities compete with:\n•Commercial banks,\n•Investment banking firms,\n•Collateralized loan obligation managers,\n•Hedge funds,\n•Mutual fund complexes,\n•Merchant banks,\n•Insurance companies,\n•Private equity firms, and\n•Other investment vehicles.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including pricing, product structure, the range of products and services offered and the quality of customer service. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for deposits and investments. Competitors may seek to compete with us through traditional channels such as physical locations or through digital channels such as the internet or mobile applications. We include here by reference the additional information regarding competition and factors affecting our competitive position included in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nHuman Capital\nWe place great importance on having the right people in the right roles, with the right skills, and doing their best work. By focusing on the growth and development of our talented team members, we believe we are best positioned to deliver results for our customers. We believe when our employees deliver for our customers, they deliver for our communities and shareholders as well.\nPNC devotes substantial resources to managing and developing human capital. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs and policies developed by our Chief Human Resources Officer and senior management team and is assisted by our Board’s Nominating and Governance and Human Resources Committees. Our Management Executive Committee assists and makes recommendations to our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors on human capital matters.\nThe Board of Directors also includes a Corporate Responsibility Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of management’s corporate responsibility efforts which are led by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer. The Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer is a member of the Executive Committee, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors provides \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nformal oversight of PNC’s corporate responsibility strategy and regularly reviews policies, programs and strategies foundational to the work of the corporate responsibility department. \nAdditionally, our Corporate Diversity Council is co-chaired by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Diversity Officer and includes senior leaders from across the organization. The council is responsible for overseeing strategic corporate initiatives that impact the creation and sustainment of an inclusive corporate culture and a talented workforce that is best positioned to serve our diverse customer base.\nEmployees totaled 55,184 at December 31, 2024. This total included 53,686 full-time and 1,498 part-time employees, of which 27,513 full-time and 1,451 part-time employees were employed in our Retail Banking business. \nPart of PNC’s ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and retain and develop our existing employees. In support of our employees, our human capital strategies include:\n•Advancing PNC’s talent-focused culture by developing strong leaders who exemplify our Leadership Standards, a set of standards designed to hold managers accountable for living our corporate values, enabling change, achieving results, fostering inclusion and developing the best talent and providing them with the tools and insights to effectively manage our people.\n•Focusing on the development and retention of high performing talent with the relevant experiences, skills and perspectives to best support the diverse group of individuals, families and businesses that we serve across the country.\n•Supporting all employees with opportunities for professional growth, career mobility and health and financial wellness.\n•Fostering an accessible and inclusive workplace where all employees and customers can feel welcome, valued and respected.\n•Supporting a strong ethical culture anchored in our corporate values and doing the right thing for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders.\nIn managing our employees, we focus on these key factors:\n•Recruiting, developing and retaining talent. We believe recruiting, developing and retaining talent starts with our leaders, and we measure our managers against our Leadership Standards. Our talent priority is to invest in the development of our internal talent and to provide career advancement opportunities to our employees. We measure how many open requisitions we fill with internal candidates, participation in early career development programs and turnover. At our first-level and above career bands we fill approximately 60% of our open requisitions with internal candidates, which has a direct impact on our ability to retain and develop our people. In addition, we hire approximately 500 interns and 400 full-time development program associates each year from our 11 early career development programs that support each of our lines of business and support areas.\n•Diversity and inclusion. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a workforce that reflects and is equipped to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. In compliance with government requirements and, in some cases, based on employee self-disclosure, we gather information related to the composition of our workforce. The racial, ethnic and gender composition of our workforce, including within our executive, senior leader and other managerial roles, is reflected in our EEO-1 reports, which are posted on our website.\n•Total rewards. We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits programs as part of our overall strategy to retain and recruit talent. We design our compensation and benefits programs to focus on three key aspects of employee well-being: health, money and quality of life. These programs include competitive base salaries and, depending on eligibility, cash incentive and/or stock-based award opportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a pension plan, healthcare, life insurance and disability benefits, health savings and dependent care flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid maternity and parental leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, a robust wellness program with incentives, family building benefits, employee assistance programs and educational assistance, among others. Additionally, we conduct pay equity analyses to determine if employees are being compensated fairly and consistently across roles.\n•Employee engagement. PNC regularly conducts employee surveys to measure employee engagement because we believe that engaged employees have lower attrition rates and improved customer outcomes.\nClimate Change Strategy\nWe recognize that environmental issues, such as climate change, could pose financial, legal and reputational risk to PNC. We strive to manage our physical footprint in a sustainable manner, incorporating climate-related risk considerations into our ERM framework, maintaining portfolio management capabilities to implement purpose-driven strategies at clients’ requests, and helping clients finance their own sustainability goals. These tenets have been incorporated into our Climate Action Strategy that was formalized at the start of 2022 to enable us to support our clients by financing their transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to ensure an appropriate balancing of environmental considerations with other organizational priorities as we pursue our purpose of helping all of our stakeholders move forward financially. The Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of PNC’s strategy, including the risks and opportunities flowing from the environmental, social and governance issues material to PNC’s business. The full Board oversees such matters directly, informed by each committees’ oversight of the corporate responsibility matters within its purview, as set forth in its charter. Given the highly integrated nature of environmental concerns, including significant climate change issues, the full Board oversees these matters as informed by insights from its committees. In addition, we have an established risk management framework that helps identify, assess, monitor and report on environmental risks, including those related to climate change. PNC’s Climate Risk Committee specifically oversees the integration of climate-related risks into the ERM Framework. \nWe assess climate change risks under two distinct categories: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks arise from risks associated with natural perils, such as hurricanes, fires, floods and drought. Physical risks may increase due to a changing climate, and we believe such increased risks are realized to a greater degree in the medium- to long-term. Transition risks are experienced as, and to the extent, the world moves toward a low-carbon economy. They can be reputational in nature or driven by changes in the market, technology and/or policy. Because transition risks are typically experienced to a greater degree in the short- to medium-term, they are dependent upon near-term policy decisions. Transition and physical risks each require a different risk management approach, and we explore a range of possible outcomes to gain insight on how to best manage these risks.\nFor more information on PNC’s climate change-related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors and the Credit Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nFinancial Information\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we file annual,\nquarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC File Number is 001-09718. You can\nobtain copies of these and other filings, including exhibits, electronically at the SEC’s internet website at www.sec.gov or on our\ncorporate internet website at www.pnc.com/secfilings.

      "text": "ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services company, certain elements of risk are inherent in what we do and the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. For more information about how we manage risks, see the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the material risk factors that affect us of which we are currently aware. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, these risks present other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks we face are also discussed further in other sections of this Report. Thus, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other External Factors, Including Regulation\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions. \nOur business and overall financial performance are affected to a significant extent by economic conditions, primarily in the U.S. Declining or adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in investor, consumer and business sentiment generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services or reduce the number of creditworthy borrowers. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is often weakened as a result of economic downturns, higher inflation and unemployment. In addition, adverse economic conditions may limit the availability of, or increase the costs of, capital and labor, erode consumer and customer purchasing power, confidence and spending and may also reduce our tolerance for extending credit. Increases in costs or expenses impacting our customers’ operations and financial performance, such as the interest rates payable on their debt obligations, could increase our credit risk or decrease the demand for our products and services.\nWe operate in an uncertain economic environment due to sustained inflationary pressures, including higher prices and lower housing affordability, and structural and secular changes arising from the pandemic for certain sectors of the economy combined with geopolitical tensions. These conditions have led and may continue to lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, often with at least some financial asset categories losing value. Financial market volatility could also result from uncertainty about the timing and extent of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Any of these effects would likely have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the adverse economic conditions. Even when economic conditions are relatively good or stable, specific economic factors can negatively affect our business and performance. This can be especially true when the factors relate to particular segments of the economy and impact our customers whose operations or financial conditions are directly or indirectly dependent on good or stable conditions in those segments. For example, given the fundamental change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, commercial real estate space remains underutilized. This, combined with higher interest rates, likely decreases demand for financial services in that sector and may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance maturing loans, contributes to decreased property values and harms the creditworthiness of some of our office commercial real estate customers, as well as businesses whose customers have historically been office workers. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nOur foreign business activities and operations continue to be a relatively small part of our overall business. As a result, the direct impact on our business and financial performance from economic conditions outside the U.S. is not likely to be significant, although the impact would increase if we expanded our foreign business and operations more than nominally. We are, however, susceptible to the risk that foreign economic conditions and geopolitical tensions could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Primarily, this risk results from the possibility that poor economic conditions or financial market disruptions affecting other major economies would also affect the U.S. Throughout the remainder of this Risk Factors section, we address specific ways in which economic issues could create risk for us and result in adverse impacts on our business and financial performance.\nThe impact of government legislation, regulation and policy and other political factors on the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nChanges in law or governmental policy affecting the economy, business activity, or personal spending, investing or saving activities may cause consumers and businesses to alter their behavior in ways that impact demand for our products and services. Such changes may also alter the profitability of the transactions in which we engage or result in increased regulatory burden and associated costs. PNC may alter the types or terms of the products and services we offer to reflect such changes. Uncertainty regarding future law or policy may have similar impacts.\nThe election of a new President together with changes in the membership of Congress, including change in control of the Senate, will likely lead to changes in the laws or policies applicable to us and the agencies that regulate us, including their interpretations of rules and guidelines. These changes may subject financial institutions like us to changes in regulation, supervision and enforcement that are difficult to predict and uncertain for a period of time and may create the possibility of significant impacts on business activity in the U.S. and globally, including impacts relating to the trade policies (including tariffs) of the U.S. or other countries. In addition, the application of some laws may require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Further, some of the laws and regulations finalized in the prior administration that are applicable to financial institutions are subject to ongoing litigation creating further uncertainty.\nThe impact that these changes may have on our operations or financial condition are discussed in more detail in the Risk Factor headed “As a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and comprehensive oversight by a variety of regulatory agencies and enforcement authorities. These regulations and their implementation can have a significant impact on our businesses and operations and our ability to grow and expand.”\nConcern regarding high and rising federal debt levels and federal budgetary matters (including the debt ceiling) also can have adverse economic consequences and create the risk of economic instability or market volatility, with potential adverse consequences to our business and financial performance. \nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance.\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, including changes in the federal funds rate, open market operations and balance sheet management, have a significant impact on interest rates, the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities, and overall financial market performance and volatility. These policies, including any resulting changes in economic conditions or in investor sentiment or perceptions, can thus affect the activities and results of operations of financial services companies such as PNC. \nAn important function of the Federal Reserve is to monitor the national supply of bank credit and set certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. Rates of interest can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Although we may not accurately predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results, we anticipate that the FOMC will cut the federal funds rate 25 basis points twice in 2025, once in May and once in July. In addition, actions by governmental authorities in other countries, including with respect to monetary policy, could impact financial markets and global interest rates, which could affect rates in the U.S. as well as rates on instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any of which could have potential effects on us as described above. Some of the potential impacts on our business and results of governmental monetary policy are described in Risk Factors under the heading “Risks Related to the Business of Banking.”\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and comprehensive oversight by a variety of regulatory agencies and enforcement authorities. These regulations and their implementation can have a significant impact on our businesses and operations and our ability to grow and expand.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC and a financial holding company, with the Federal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC Bank is a federally chartered bank, with the OCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple other banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of criminal and civil enforcement authorities. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, with multiple regulators or agencies having supervisory or enforcement oversight over aspects of our business activities. These laws, regulations and supervisory activities are intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, consumer protection and to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and are not primarily \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nintended to protect PNC security holders. In addition to regulation in the U.S., we are also subject to foreign regulation to a limited extent as a result of our business activities outside the U.S.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and require compliance with provisions designed to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We also are subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities. Over time, the scope of the laws and regulations affecting our businesses, as well as the number of requirements or limitations imposed by legislative or regulatory actions, has increased, and we expect to continue to face substantial regulatory oversight and new or revised regulatory requirements or initiatives, including those related to requirements for the orderly resolution of financial institutions. As we expand our product and service offerings into additional markets, domestic or foreign, either through organic growth or acquisition, we have faced and will continue to face increases in state or foreign regulation affecting our operations. Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions, including potentially conflicting state-level regulation, could materially increase our compliance costs or risks of non-compliance. Legislative or regulatory actions can result in increased compliance costs, reduced business opportunities, or requirements and limitations on how we conduct our business. In particular, the financial services industry continues to face heightened scrutiny, including with respect to BSA/AML, know-your-customer and export and sanctions compliance requirements, consumer compliance and protection matters (such as with respect to overdraft and other fees), and capital, liquidity and resolution planning in response to systemic events in the banking industry. In addition, heightened standards under proposed and recently finalized rules, such as those implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, may result in increased obligations and compliance costs, and may factor into our ability to expand and engage in new actions. Although the new presidential administration has indicated an intent to pursue the regulation of the financial services industry differently than was the case under the previous administration, there is significant uncertainty regarding the direction this administration will take and its ability to implement its policies and objectives, as well as the ultimate impact on potential new regulatory initiatives and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations.\nFederal law grants substantial supervisory and enforcement powers to federal banking regulators, and they have assumed an active oversight, examination and enforcement role across the financial services industry. The results of supervisory or examination activities by our regulators, including actual or perceived compliance failures, could result in limitations on our ability to enter into certain transactions, engage in new activities, expand geographically, make acquisitions or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith, or otherwise require us to modify our businesses practices in a manner that materially impacts our financial condition or results of operations. These activities also could result in significant fines, penalties or required corrective actions, some of which could be expensive, difficult to implement or materially impact our business or financial condition. In addition, another financial institution’s violation of law or regulation may give rise to an investigation of the same or similar activities of PNC. Further, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements and expectations exposes us to the risk of damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory or enforcement actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in new activities and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business. We also rely on third parties who may expose us to compliance risk. A failure to comply with regulatory requirements or deficiencies in risk management practices could be incorporated in our confidential supervisory ratings, which could limit PNC’s ability to expand or require additional approvals before engaging in certain business activities. See the immediately following Risk Factor for a discussion of risks associated with capital and liquidity regulation. Also see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report and Note 19 Regulatory Matters for more information concerning the regulation of PNC, including those areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect our business, operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. These regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the Basel Committee and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory agencies can apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by the Basel Committee. In several instances, the U.S. banking agencies have done so with respect to U.S. banking organizations.\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity, and regulatory expectations as to the quality of our capital and liquidity, impact our business activities and may prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force us to take actions contrary to their interests. For example, PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with its SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. The Federal Reserve can also impose additional limitations on capital distributions, such as limitations on distributions during times of economic stress. In addition, dividends or other capital distributions from PNC Bank and, to a lesser extent, non-bank subsidiaries are PNC’s principal source of funds to, among other things, pay dividends on and make repurchases of its capital stock. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prohibit \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nor limit dividends to PNC. Limitations on PNC’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries, including PNC Bank, could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on and make repurchases of its capital stock, especially to the extent that PNC must first service any outstanding debt obligations. Capital and liquidity requirements may also impact the amount and type of loans we make. We may be constrained in our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. We may be forced to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, liquidity standards require us to maintain holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets, even if more desirable from an earnings, balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective.\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements are subject to regular review and revision by the Basel Committee and the U.S. banking agencies. Although the federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule in July 2023 to implement the final components of the Basel III framework, the status of this rule, and potential revisions to the rule, remain uncertain. The regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks, as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards that are applicable to PNC, including related proposed rules, are discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur ability to operate our business could be impaired if our liquidity is unexpectedly constrained. \nOur liquidity could be impaired as a result of unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, an inability to sell assets (or to sell assets at favorable times or prices), a default by a counterparty or other market participant, our inability to access other sources of liquidity, including from sources that have historically been available or through the capital markets due to unforeseen market dislocations or interruptions, or a lack of market or customer confidence in PNC or financial institutions in general. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. In addition, if access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding is reduced, alternative sources of funding could be more expensive and limited in availability. The increased speed with which information is disseminated, through official or social media, could increase the speed or severity of liquidity pressures caused by, for example, negative news about PNC’s or other financial institutions’ financial prospects or safety and soundness. A negative impact on our liquidity would likely limit our ability to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities as well as meet regulatory expectations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For information on our liquidity management, see the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could significantly impact our liquidity, funding costs and access to the capital markets.\nOur credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the financial strength of PNC and PNC Bank, and factors outside of our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds, increase our cost of capital and limit the number of investors or counterparties willing to do business with or lend to us. For example, downgrades could negatively impact our right to continue to service mortgages and hold related escrows and reserves. Downgrades could also adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers, including deposits. In addition, a downgrade in our credit ratings could trigger obligations to make cash or collateral payments under derivative contracts with certain counterparties. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings and outlooks. For information on our credit ratings and outlooks, see the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report.\nPrivacy and consumer data rights initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on PNC, and they may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data.\nOver time, there has been an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy and enhance the portability of personal data. Individuals whose personal information may be protected by law may include our customers, prospective customers, job applicants, employees and third parties. These initiatives, among other things, limit how companies can use personal data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data, including requiring companies like PNC to make available to consumers and authorized third parties certain data relating to transactions and accounts and establishing obligations for accessing such data. Financial services companies such as PNC necessarily gather, maintain and use a significant amount of personal data. These types of initiatives increase compliance complexity and related costs, may result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures, and may limit our ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes. This is particularly true as we expand our business and operations into new markets. We are, or may become, subject to regularly evolving and developing data privacy and security laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions even where our presence in such jurisdictions is minimal. Such legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of personal data by us, our vendors or others who gain unauthorized access to our personal data. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar requirements that impose different and potentially inconsistent compliance burdens. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nClimate change-related risks could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nThere continues to be concern, including on the part of certain regulators and in certain jurisdictions where we do business or have operations, regarding climate change and its impacts over the short-, medium- and long-term horizons. These concerns over the impacts of climate change (including physical risk and transition risk) have led and may continue to lead to efforts to mitigate those impacts. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, the reduced availability of insurance or sufficient insurance to cover losses, operations disruptions and changes and other impacts because of climate change (including because of the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events and long-term shifts in the climate) and governmental actions or societal responses to climate change. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including their reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities and their transition plans, as well as their exposure to the effects of climate change. Consumers and businesses may also change their behaviors because of these concerns. Changed consumer and business behavior because of climate change concerns creates transition risk for PNC arising from the process of adjusting to these concerns. PNC and its customers will need to respond to any new laws and regulations as well as any changes in consumer and business preferences related to climate change. Among the impacts to PNC could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors if our products or services do not support the environmental goals of our customers, or increased losses due to the impact of climate change on the collateral that secures customer borrowings. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. \nWe are currently subject to climate-related regulatory expectations and could be subject to additional regulatory restrictions or costs associated with providing products or services to certain companies or sectors. Additionally, the federal government may alter climate policies or requirements in a way that significantly conflicts with certain state-level policies or investor expectations. Such changes may present risk to PNC due to inconsistent expectations, requirements or costs. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services necessary to run our business. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of any new laws and regulations or any changes in consumer or business behavior, including those resulting from activist pressure. Our risk management needs to continue to evolve, or it may not be effective in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling climate risk exposure, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of climate change may not be predictable. \nWe have been and may continue to be subject to conflicting pressure from individuals, groups and governmental entities to cease doing business, or to maintain business, with certain companies or sectors, in particular those involved with fossil fuels, because of concerns related to climate change. Further, there is increased scrutiny of climate change-related policies, goals and disclosures, including with regard to inaccurate or misleading statements regarding these practices (often referred to as “greenwashing”), which could result in litigation and regulatory investigations and actions. Our stakeholders may disagree with these policies and goals or, conversely, believe that these policies and goals are, and our related progress in accomplishing such goals and implementing such policies is, insufficient. This may lead to a decrease in demand for our products and services or damage to our reputation. We may also incur additional costs and require additional resources as we evolve our strategy, practices and related disclosures with respect to these matters. In addition, there are and will continue to be challenges related to capturing, verifying, analyzing and disclosing climate-related data that is subject to measurement uncertainties. The Risk Factor headed “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation” further discusses risks associated with our management of these matters, including related activist pressure.\nRisks Related to the Use of Technology\nThe use of technology is critical to our ability to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of our businesses.\nAs a large financial services company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, monitor and report on our transactions and those of our customers. Over time, we have seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs as well as higher expectations of customers and requirements of regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. In many cases, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers. As a result of these factors, the financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Examples include expanded use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, biometric authentication, voice and natural language, data protection enhancements and increased online and mobile device interaction with customers, including innovative ways that customers can manage their accounts.\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations, as well as competitive pressures, we continue to invest in technology and connectivity. We are seeking to automate functions previously performed manually, facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. This effort has involved and is likely to continue to involve the expenditure of considerable amounts of funds and other resources, which could be constrained to the extent that sustained adverse economic conditions and other factors described elsewhere in these Risk Factors negatively impact our business or financial performance. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nrespect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations, because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, or because we fail to keep pace with our competitors, would likely cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense. Our ability to maintain or enhance our relative technological position is in part dependent on our ability to attract and retain talented employees in these fields.\nOur use of technology is dependent on having the right to use its underlying intellectual property.\nIn some cases, we develop internally the intellectual property embedded in the technology we use. In others, we or our vendors license the use of intellectual property from others. Where we rely on access to third-party intellectual property, it may not be available to us on commercially reasonably terms or at all. Regardless of the source of the intellectual property, if another person or entity were deemed to own intellectual property rights infringed by our activities, we could be responsible for significant damages covering past activities and substantial fees to continue to engage in these types of activities. It also is possible that we could be prevented from using technology important to our business for at least some period of time. In such circumstances, there may be no alternative technology for us to use or an appropriate alternative technology might be expensive to obtain. We could also suffer significant reputational damage in these circumstances. Protections offered by those from whom we license technology against these risks may be inadequate to cover any losses in full. Over time, there have been and continue to be instances where technology used by PNC has been alleged to have infringed patents held by others, and, in some cases, we have suffered related losses.\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of our information systems and other technology.\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of our information systems and other technology has become more important and challenging, and the costs involved in that effort continue to be high. Our ability to create, obtain, maintain and report on information in an accurate, timely and secure manner is a foundational component of our business. Effective management of our expanded digital products and services, geographic footprint and continued remote work environment heightens our need for secure, reliable and adequate information systems and technology. The risks of operational failures in the use of these systems result from a variety of factors. We are vulnerable to the impact of failures of our systems to operate as needed or intended. Failures leading to materially adverse impacts could include those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or overall security, design or performance issues. In addition, our ability to use our technology effectively could be impacted due to outages, bad weather, disasters, bad actors, terrorism and the like. Such events could affect our systems directly or limit our ability to use our technology due to effects on key underlying infrastructure. Although we regularly update and replace systems that we depend on as our needs evolve and technology improves, we continue to utilize some older systems that may not be as reliable as newer ones. In addition, the implementation of and transition to new or updated systems creates risks related to associated timing and costs, disruptions in functionality for us or for customers, including the ability to perform functions critical to our business and operations, and longer-term failures to achieve desired improvements. Our ability to maintain, timely update and replace systems can become more challenging as the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of information on these systems increases. In some cases, the risk results from the potential for bad acts on the part of others, discussed in more detail in the Risk Factor headed “We are vulnerable to the risk of breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information that could adversely affect our customers and our business.”\nWe rely on information systems maintained by other companies. We use other companies both to provide products and services directly to us and to assist us in providing products and services to our customers. Others provide the infrastructure that supports, for example, communications, payment, clearing and settlement systems, or information processing and storage. These companies range from those providing highly sophisticated information processing to those that provide fundamental services, such as electric power and telecommunications. In some cases, these other companies themselves utilize third parties to support their delivery of products and services to us and our customers. Systems maintained by or for these other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems and thus their issues could have a negative impact on PNC. We necessarily have less ability to provide oversight over other companies’ information systems.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, including those where there is not a reasonably available alternative, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to us. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread, extends for a significant period of time, or results in financial losses to our customers. The consequences of failures to operate systems properly can result in disruptions to our critical business operations, including our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan, payment and other systems. Such events could also cause errors in transactions or impair system functionality with customers, vendors or other parties. Possible adverse consequences also include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business, which could occur even if the negative impact on customers was de minimis. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny relating to such events. This in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of adversely affected customers. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, information systems issues at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including us. Also, system problems, including those resulting from third-party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, may broadly increase legislative, regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information that could adversely affect our customers and our business.\nMost corporate and commercial financial transactions are now handled electronically, and our commercial and retail customers increasingly use online access as well as mobile and cloud technologies to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner depends on the transmission and storage of confidential information in electronic form. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, we maintain and process vast amounts of digital information about us, our customers and our employees. This information tends to be confidential or proprietary and much of it is highly sensitive. Such highly sensitive information includes information sufficient to support identity theft and personal health information, as well as information regarding business plans and financial performance that has not been made public. As a result, efforts by bad actors to engage in various types of cyber attacks pose serious risks to our business and reputation.\nWe are faced with ongoing, nearly continual, efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. The effectiveness of these efforts may be enhanced using AI. These efforts may be to obtain access to confidential or proprietary information, often with the intent of stealing from or defrauding us or our customers, or to disrupt our ability to conduct our business, including by destroying or impairing access to information maintained by us. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of social engineering schemes to gain access to confidential information from our employees, customers or vendors. Our risk and exposure to data security breaches is heightened because of our expanded digital products and services, geographic footprint and continued remote work environment, which results in more access points to our network. The same risks are presented by attacks potentially affecting information held by third parties on our behalf or accessed by third parties, including those offering financial applications, on behalf of our customers. These risks also arise when third parties with whom we do business, or their vendors or other entities with whom they do business, are themselves subject to breaches and attacks, which has impacted our business and may do so in the future. Our ability to protect confidential or proprietary information is even more limited with respect to information held by these parties. For example, we are likely to be limited in our ability to identify and quickly resolve breaches and attacks that may impact our business the further removed an entity is from our business, such as when a breach or attack occurs at vendors of our vendors. We may suffer reputational damage or legal liability for unauthorized access to customer information held by other parties, even if we were not responsible for preventing such access and had no reasonable way of preventing it.\nOur customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us and may provide their PNC customer information (including passwords) to a third party in connection with obtaining services from that third party, including those offering financial applications. Although we take steps to provide safety and security for our customers’ transactions with us and their customer information, to the extent they utilize their own devices or provide third parties access to their accounts, our ability to assure such safety and security is necessarily limited. These risks are heightened as we and others continue to expand mobile applications, cloud solutions, and other internet-based financial product offerings. For example, a number of our customers choose to use financial applications that allow them to view, access and aggregate banking and other financial account information on a single platform, to monitor the performance of their investments, to compare financial and investment products, to make payments or transfer funds, and otherwise to help manage their finances and investments. Some financial applications ask users to provide their secure banking log-in information, credentials or other account-identifying information so the applications can link to users’ accounts at financial institutions. Companies offering these applications frequently use third-party data aggregators, which are behind-the-scenes technology companies that serve as data-gathering service providers, to deliver customer financial data that is then used by the financial applications. To do this, data aggregators may be obtaining customers’ log-in information, credentials or other account-identifying information, which allow the aggregators to access the customers’ account information and “scrape” or obtain the customers’ data, often on a daily or even more frequent basis. That same information has the potential to facilitate fraud if it is not properly protected. This has resulted in incidences of fraud, including automated clearing house fraud, credit card fraud, and wire fraud, enabled through the use of synthetic identities and through account takeovers via these platforms. In addition, transactions by customers on financial applications that facilitate payments and fund transfers have also been fraudulently induced. These transactions occur when a customer authorizes payment to a recipient that fraudulently induced the customer into transferring a payment to such recipient. PNC has and may continue to face increased financial exposure due to activity associated with the increased use of these applications and data aggregators. Even where PNC does not have financial exposure for losses, PNC and the third parties with whom we do business could suffer increased reputational harm or regulatory scrutiny when such losses occur.\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is also the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information often is provided to such businesses. If a business’s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. We can be responsible for reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach. Moreover, to the extent \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nmore consumer confidential information becomes available to bad actors through the cumulative effect of data breaches at companies generally, bad actors may find it easier to use such information to gain access to our customer accounts.\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining access to credit card or user credential information, but instead seek access to a range of other types of confidential information, such as internal emails and other forms of customer financial information, and this information may be used to support a ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have sought to deny access to data and possibly shut down systems and devices maintained by target companies. In a ransomware attack, system data is encrypted, stolen or extorted, or access is otherwise denied, accompanied by a demand for ransom to restore access to the data or to prevent public disclosure of confidential information. Attacks have also been conducted through business email compromise scams that involve using social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive or established vendor. These types of phishing attacks have increased over time, and they have evolved to include other types of attacks like vishing (through voice messages) and smishing (through SMS text). Other attacks have included distributed denial of service cyber attacks, in which individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. Similarly, attacks have been conducted through application program interfaces where cyber attackers seek to exploit the interfaces between mobile or web applications. We (as well as other financial services companies) have been subject to such attacks. Recent cyber attacks have also included the insertion of malware into software updates and the infection of software while it is under assembly, known as a “supply chain attack.” Attacks on our customers may put these relationships at risk, particularly if customers’ ability to continue operations is impaired due to the losses suffered. The techniques used in cyber attacks change rapidly and are increasingly sophisticated, including through the use of generative AI and deepfakes, and we expect in the future through the use of quantum computing, and we may not be able to anticipate cyber attacks or data security breaches.\nIn addition to threats from external sources, insider threats represent a significant risk to us. Insiders, including those having legitimate access to our systems and the information contained in them, have the easiest opportunity to make inappropriate use of the systems and information. Addressing that risk requires understanding not only how to protect us from unauthorized use and disclosure of data, but also how to engage behavioral analytics and other tools to identify potential internal threats before any damage is done. In addition, due to the number of employees who work remotely, the opportunity for insiders to grant access to third parties or to disclose confidential information of PNC or its customers has increased. As more work is conducted outside of PNC’s facilities, the risk of improper access to PNC’s network or confidential information has increased, including for reasons such as a failure by an employee or contractor to secure a device with PNC access.\nWe have been and expect to continue to be the target of some of these types of cyber attacks. To date, none of these types of cyber attacks has had a material impact on us. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely block efforts by bad actors to harm us, and there can be no assurance that future cyber attacks will not be material. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. As a result, we could suffer material financial and reputational losses in the future from any of these or other types of attacks or the public perception that such an attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct. Attacks on others, some of which have led to serious adverse consequences, demonstrate the risks posed by new and evolving types of cyber attacks.\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk of failures or breaches occurring in our information systems and to mitigate the impact when they do.\nWe have policies, procedures and systems (including cybersecurity and business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. We continue to devote appropriate resources toward improving the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats and expect to continue to do so in the future. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to allow us to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies, procedures and systems to protect us in any future situation, nor the effectiveness of our oversight of risk at third parties. Although we have policies, procedures and systems designed to mitigate third-party risk, our ability to implement policies, procedures and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is necessarily limited. Should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have financial protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.\nMethods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication). A new method of attack often is not recognized until launched against a target. Attacks in some cases appear to be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities and often originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. We have seen a higher volume and complexity of attacks during times of increased geopolitical tensions. As a result, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures to address these methods in advance of attacks. Even with our proactive and defensive measures in place, adverse events are likely to occur, and there remains the risk that one or more such events would be material to PNC. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning, our ability to identify and understand threats to us from a holistic perspective, our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\noccurs, with novel or unusual events posing a greater risk, and our ability to identify and quickly resolve vulnerabilities in our information systems and those of third parties upon which we rely. It is also the case that a vulnerability or an adverse event may go undetected for a period of time, with the adverse consequences likely greater the longer it takes to discover the problem. In many cases, it also depends on the preparedness and responses of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal. Additionally, our failure to communicate cyber incidents appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory, legal, operational and reputational risk.\nRisks Related to the Business of Banking\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial services business. It results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and securities and the importance of lending activity to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties, by diversifying our loan portfolio, by obtaining and monitoring collateral for certain exposures and by investing primarily in high quality securities.\nA borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by many factors. Individual borrowers can be affected, for example, by declines in income, job losses, health issues or family issues. Commercial borrowers can be affected, for example, by poor business performance, changes in customer behavior or catastrophic losses. Weakness in the economy or in financial markets typically adversely impacts the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. We are exposed to increased credit risk if we fail to evaluate properly at origination the likely ability of a borrower to repay a loan. Properly estimating the current and potential value of any collateral pledged to support the loan also is critical to effectively managing credit risk. A failure to identify declining creditworthiness of a borrower or declining collateral value at a time when remedial actions could reduce our exposure increases credit risk. Any decrease in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans likely would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Managing credit risk effectively also relies on forecasts of future overall economic conditions, which are inherently imperfect. We also have credit risk arising from many other types of business relationships. Routine transactions give us credit exposure to brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, other institutional clients, as well as vendors and other non-financial entities.\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when the value of collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized, including because of legal or regulatory changes, or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. In addition, credit risk may be exacerbated when counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through our ACL estimated under CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects expected lifetime losses, which has led and could continue to lead to volatility in the allowance and the provision for credit losses as economic forecasts, actual credit performance and other factors used in the loss estimating process change. We also have reserves for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Changes to expected losses are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses. A worsening of economic conditions or our economic outlook or an increase in credit risk, particularly following a period of good economic conditions, would likely lead to an increase in provision for credit losses with a resulting reduction in our net income and an increase to our allowance. Conversely, an improvement of economic conditions or our economic outlook, particularly following a period of poor economic conditions, could result in a recapture of provision for credit losses for a period of time with a resulting increase in our net income and decrease in our allowance. Either set of conditions is not likely to be sustained and may obscure actual current operations and financial performance. The section headed “Risks Related to Estimates and Assumptions” further discusses risks associated with estimating expected losses under CECL.\nThe concentration and mix of our assets could increase the potential for significant credit losses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often have heightened credit exposure to a particular industry, geography, asset class or financial market. As an example, loans secured by real estate typically represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. It also represents a portion of the assets underlying our investment securities. While there are limitations on the extent of total exposure to an individual consumer or business borrower, events adversely affecting some of our clients or counterparties, based on individual factors or the nature or location of their business, or asset classes or financial markets in which we are involved, could materially and adversely affect us. As described elsewhere in these Risk Factors, the fundamental shift in office demand combined with higher interest rates contributes to decreased property values and harms the creditworthiness of some of our office commercial real estate customers. Declining economic conditions also may impact commercial borrowers more than consumer borrowers, or vice versa. In addition, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industries. Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, uncertainty about the stability of other financial services institutions could lead to market-wide losses and defaults. Thus, the concentration and mix of our assets may affect the severity of the impact of recessions or other economic downturns on us.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nOur business and financial performance are impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:\n•Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest that we pay on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings, which impacts our overall net interest income and margin as well as our profitability.\n•Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments and can, in turn, increase our credit losses on those assets.\n•Such changes can decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.\n•Such changes affect our hedging of various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.\n•Movements in interest rates also affect loan prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\n•Increases in interest rates likely lower the price we would receive on fixed-rate customer obligations if we were to sell them.\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments adjust promptly in accordance with changes in market rates, while others adjust only periodically or are fixed throughout a defined term. As a result, the impact of changes in interest rates can be either increased or diluted due to differences in the relative variability of the rates paid on our liabilities in relation to the rates received on our assets. The extent to which we have elected to hedge interest rate risk through interest rate swaps also affects the impact of rate changes. We attempt to manage the balance sheet to increase our benefit or reduce negative impacts from future movements in interest rates, but failures to anticipate actual movements may have the opposite result. In addition, we do not generally hedge all of our risk and our attempt to hedge any risk does not mean we will be successful.\nWhile higher interest rates generally enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are risks associated with a rising interest rate environment. As a general matter, increasing rates tend to decrease the value of fixed-rate financial instruments held on our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk Factor headed “Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.” Also, customers have and may continue to be less willing or able to borrow at higher rates. Higher interest rates also have hindered and may continue to hinder the ability of borrowers to support interest payments on variable rate loans. Higher interest rates have and may continue to indirectly affect the value of asset classes such as real estate typically financed through secured loans, with a resulting negative effect on collateral securing such loans. As another example, there are increased competitive pressures as rates on deposit products rise. The benefits of higher interest rates are best achieved if we can increase the rates on loans and other assets faster than the rates on deposits and other liabilities increase. We may not be able to achieve this result in a rising rate environment, especially if central banks introduce rate increases more quickly than anticipated. On the other hand, lower interest rates tend to have a negative impact on our net interest margin, and, unless offset by higher earning assets, on our net interest income. We discuss the impact of governmental monetary policy on interest rates in the Risk Factor headed “The policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance.”\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.\nAs a financial institution, a substantial majority of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. Examples include loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings. Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question. The underlying value of assets under lease or securing an obligation generally decreases due to increases in supply or decreases in demand for the asset or deterioration in the condition of the asset. This could negatively impact the ability to collect fully on the secured obligation. Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers or other counterparties and due to changes in market interest rates.\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and liabilities to market and recognize such changes either through net income or OCI. Thus, gains or losses on these assets and liabilities can have a direct impact on our results of operations and financial performance, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. We may need to record losses in the value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed. Our remaining assets and liabilities are not marked to market. As a result, our balance sheet does not precisely represent the fair market value of our financial assets and liabilities. In addition, asset management revenue is earned primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related noninterest income.\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nRisks Related to Estimates and Assumptions\nOur asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective. Our estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nOur accounting policies are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these policies and methods to comply with GAAP and reflect management’s judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report PNC’s financial condition and results of operations. Management’s selection of a particular accounting policy to apply, while reasonable and appropriate, could result in PNC reporting different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC and other regulatory agencies may issue new or amend existing accounting and reporting standards or change existing interpretations of those standards that could materially affect our financial statements. In some cases, PNC may be required to retrospectively apply a new or amended standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.\nCertain accounting policies require that we use estimates, assumptions and judgments in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to legal proceedings and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. These policies require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For example, CECL requires us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about future economic and market conditions in determining the ACL.\nSome of our financial instruments, including certain derivatives, debt securities, loans, MSRs and private equity investments, among other items, require a determination of their fair value for our financial statements. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it would be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically traded in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In addition, we have assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The valuation of any asset or liability substantially based on unobservable inputs is necessarily less reliable than those based on active trading markets. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements. Our ability to hedge exposure is in part dependent on our ability to value the related assets or liabilities.\nThe determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowances and asset impairments, due to the subjective nature of this area, the level of impairments taken, and allowances reflected in our financial statements may not accurately reflect the actual level of risk and the amount of future losses.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models, some of which use AI, in our business.\nWe use financial and statistical models throughout many areas of our business, relying on them to inform decision making, automate processes, and estimate many financial values. Although it currently impacts a minority of the overall number of models that we use, we increasingly use models related to how we do business with customers and for internal process automation that leverage AI/machine learning algorithms. These models can be more predictive, but because of the complex way in which the many variables in AI/machine learning models interact, the results of these models are often less interpretable than traditional statistical models. Examples of model uses include determining the pricing of various products, identifying potentially fraudulent or suspicious transactions, marketing to potential customers, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, and assessing capital adequacy. We depend significantly on models for credit loss accounting under CECL, capital stress testing and estimating the value of items in our financial statements.\nModels generally predict or infer certain financial outcomes, leveraging historical data and assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macroeconomic conditions. Development and implementation of some of these models, such as the models for credit loss accounting under CECL, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Other models are used to support decisions made regarding how we do business with customers. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. For example, our models may not be effective if historical data does not accurately represent future events or environments or if our models rely on erroneous data, formulas, algorithms or assumptions and our internal model review processes fail to detect and address these flaws. Models, if flawed, could cause information we provide to the public or to our regulators to be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distribution to our shareholders, would likely be affected adversely if they perceive that the quality of the relevant models we use is insufficient. Finally, flaws in our models that \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nnegatively impact our customers or our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations could negatively affect our reputation or result in fines and penalties from our regulators.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Customers\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with declines in customer demand for our products and services. As a result of the nature of those products and services, we are particularly at risk for losses of economic confidence or customer trust in us or, more broadly, in financial services institutions like us. Economic and market developments may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to concerns regarding the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer. If we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease, and we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and noninterest income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions. Demand for our products and services could also suffer as many of the risks to PNC related to the economy and other external factors, including regulation, such as changes to tax laws and tax rates, could negatively impact consumers and businesses and their interest in or ability to use our products and services.\nOur ability to attract and retain customer deposits is impacted by the levels of interest rates, as customers balance the benefits of bank accounts with deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products against the possibility of higher yields from other investments. In general, if the spread between the rates we offer and those offered by alternatives to bank accounts widens, customers are often willing to forego the benefits of bank accounts (such as FDIC insurance) for higher returns elsewhere. Our customers have removed and could continue to remove money from deposit accounts with us in favor of other banks or other types of cash management products, such as emerging financial technologies, including digital wallets, non-fungible tokens and digital currencies and cryptocurrencies. In such circumstances, we need to increase rates to levels that are seen as competitive or lose customers, in either case with a negative impact to net interest income. In addition, deposits are a low-cost source of funds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income. Loss of customers could also harm noninterest income by decreasing fee-bearing transaction volume. In addition, when rates are higher, customers tend to shift deposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to interest-bearing ones, thereby negatively impacting net interest income.\nOur customers increasingly use third-party financial applications that are expected to interface with their PNC accounts. This use leads to the risk that issues with respect to the effective functioning of that interface, regardless of cause, could result in a loss of customers as they seek banking relationships that work better with these other applications.\nNews or other publicity that harms our reputation, or harms the reputation of our industry generally, could cause a loss of customers or a reduction in the extent to which customers do business with us. This is described further in the Risk Factor headed “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.”\nIn our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment advice or performance could hurt revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have an adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain customers and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation and having the trust of our customers, employees, the communities that we serve and other stakeholders. Many types of developments, if publicized, can negatively impact a company’s reputation with adverse consequences to its business.\nFinancial services companies are highly vulnerable to reputational damage when they are found to have harmed customers, particularly retail customers, through conduct that is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive, abusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful. There also may be reputational damage from human error or systems failures viewed as having harmed customers without involving misconduct, including service disruptions or negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect client data. For example, we may suffer reputational harm to the extent that we are unable to successfully detect, prevent and remedy fraud that harms our clients. Our reputation may also be harmed by failing to deliver products and services of the quality expected by our customers and support the communities that we serve. In addition, our reputation may be harmed as a result of our participation in certain programs, such as those perceived to be supporting environmental, social or governance matters, that may expose us to increased scrutiny and criticism. Significant acquisitions by large banks also often attract public scrutiny, which may result in negative publicity that adversely affects our reputation if we engage in such a transaction. We are also subject to the risk of reputational harm resulting from conduct of persons identified as our employees but acting outside of the scope of their employment, including through their misconduct, unethical behavior, or activities on personal social media. The reputational impact is likely greater to the extent that the bad conduct, errors or failures are pervasive, long-standing or affect a significant number of customers, \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nparticularly retail consumers. The negative impact of such reputational damage on our business may be disproportionate to the actual harm caused to customers. It may be severe even if we fully remediate any harm suffered by our customers. Furthermore, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “PNC” brand, negative public opinion about one business could also affect our other businesses. In addition, we could suffer reputational harm and a loss of customer trust as a result of the conduct of others in our industry even if we have not engaged in such conduct. We use third parties to help in many aspects of our business, with the risk that their conduct can affect our reputation regardless of the degree to which we are responsible for it. The speed with which information moves through social media and other news sources on the internet means that negative information about PNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse impact on our reputation. This is true whether or not the information is accurate. False information can also be spread from unaffiliated or parody social media accounts pretending to be official company communications channels. Once information has gone viral, it can be difficult to counter it effectively, either by correcting inaccuracies or communicating remedial steps taken for actual issues. The potential impact of negative information going viral means that material reputational harm can result from a single discrete or isolated incident.\nTo an increasing extent, financial services companies, including PNC, are facing criticism with accompanying reputational risk from activists, investors and stakeholders who believe companies should be focusing more or less on environmental, social and governance matters. Companies in our industry, including PNC, are targeted for engaging in business with specific customers or with customers in particular industries, where the customers’ activities, even if legal, are perceived as having harmful impacts on matters such as the environment, consumer health and safety, or society at large. At the same time, financial services firms may face criticism and reputational harm if they are perceived as declining to provide, or ceasing to provide, banking and other services to businesses engaged in lawful activities or individuals due to their political or social viewpoints. In addition, some activists, investors and other stakeholders are seeking increased transparency and action from financial services companies with respect to environmental, social and governance activities, political activities and activities that are or may be perceived to be politically partisan in nature. Criticism has come in many forms, including protests at PNC facilities and social media campaigns. In some circumstances, our stakeholders have held and continue to hold conflicting views on the role PNC and other financial services companies should play in continuing to or refraining from financing certain sectors. In some cases, we are subject to potentially conflicting proposed and enacted state and local laws affecting our industry that regulate the manner in which or whether we may finance or service certain clients, industries or sectors. The potential for conflict may increase in instances where federal law is silent or is found not to preempt state law. Many of these issues are divisive without broad agreement as to the appropriate steps a company such as PNC should take. As a result, however we respond to such criticism, we expose ourselves to the risks that current or potential customers decline to do business with us (or encourage others to do so) or current or potential employees refuse to work for us. This can be true regardless of whether we are perceived by some as not having done enough to address these concerns or by others as having inappropriately yielded to these pressures. These pressures can also be a factor in decisions as to which business opportunities and customers we pursue, potentially resulting in foregone profit opportunities.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business.\nWe are subject to intense competition both from other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including financial technology companies (often referred to as “FinTech”). In many cases, non-bank entities can engage in many activities similar to ours or offer products and services desirable to our customers without being subject to the same types of regulation, supervision and restrictions that are applicable to banks, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Emerging financial technologies, including with respect to payment services and systems, lending, digital wallets, non-fungible tokens and digital currencies and cryptocurrencies, may affect our customers’ needs and expectations for products and services. We may fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers. We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unwilling to provide products or services that we deem to be speculative or risky. The competition we face is described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.”\nConsolidation in our industry, including among smaller banks combining to form more competitive larger ones and between banks and non-bank entities, could result in PNC facing more intense competition, particularly in impacted regions or with respect to particular products. As we expand into new markets, we may face competitors with more experience and established relationships in these markets, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. A failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, competitive pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin, negatively impacting our net interest income.\nWe depend on skilled labor, and employee attrition, competition for talented employees and labor shortages may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nPart of our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and retain and develop our existing employees. We face significant competition for these employees across many of our businesses and support areas. This presents greater risk as we expand into new markets, develop new product lines, or enhance staffing in certain areas, particularly technology. This competition leads to increased expenses in affected business areas. Differences in demands, expectations and priorities of the \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\nworkforce (such as remote work expectations) may require us to modify our recruiting and retention strategies to attract and retain employees. Limitations on the way regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions, including PNC, to compete with other companies for talent.\nRisks Related to Other Operational Issues\nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity of employees, and the systems and controls for which they are responsible, to manage operational risks.\nWe are a large company that offers a wide variety of products and services to a broad and diverse group of customers. We rely on our employees to design, manage and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and manage processes, transactions and other relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. In some cases, we rely on employees of third parties to perform these tasks. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. These concerns are increased when we change processes or procedures, introduce new products or services, acquire or invest in a business or implement new technologies, as we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes. These concerns may be further exacerbated by employee turnover and labor shortages.\nAs a large financial services firm, we are faced with ongoing attempts by individuals or organizations to defraud us or our customers for financial gain. We depend on systems, processes and personnel, either at PNC or from third parties, to identify and prevent potentially fraudulent transactions, but those systems may not be adequate and fraudulent actors regularly change tactics to improve their chance of success. Even if PNC is not financially responsible for reimbursing a customer for its fraud losses, such losses may damage PNC’s reputation or ability to attract and retain customers. \nAs a result of our necessary reliance on employees, whether ours or those of third parties, to perform these tasks and manage resulting risks, we are thus subject to human vulnerabilities. These range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance, potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures. Our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business, including risks associated with the design, operation and monitoring of automated systems. We may also fail to adequately maintain a culture of risk management among our employees. Errors by our employees or others responsible for systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of those systems and controls to prevent unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal conduct could result in significant harm to PNC. This harm could include customer remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions or limitations on our business activities. We could also suffer damage to our reputation, as described under “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.”\nWe use automation, machine learning, AI and robotic process automation tools to help reduce some risks of human error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely on many manual processes to conduct our business and manage our risks. In addition, use of automation tools does not eliminate the need for effective design and monitoring of their operation to make sure they operate as intended. Enhanced use of automation may present its own risks. Automated systems may themselves experience outages or problems. Some tools are dependent on the quality of the data used by the tool to learn and enhance the process for which it is responsible. Bad, missing or anomalous data can adversely affect the functioning of such tools. It is possible that humans in some cases are better able than highly automated tools to identify that anomalous data is being used or that results are themselves anomalous.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, service providers and other counterparties to help support many aspects of our business. When we do so, our direct control of activities related to our business is reduced, which introduces risk.\nOur use of third parties to support our business needs typically means that we do not directly control the activities we are having them perform. Any disruption in services provided by these third parties could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Replacing third parties could also entail significant delay and expense. Risks can arise through inadequate performance by a third party (including by its downstream service providers), specifically where that performance could affect us or our customers, and even when the result of factors or events are beyond such third party’s control. Many of the kinds of risks presented by activities performed by third parties are described elsewhere in these Risk Factors. Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of our use of third-party vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures. We are also vulnerable, including to regulatory penalties, if an outside company fails to comply with legal requirements relevant to its work on our behalf. We may in any such circumstance suffer financial losses, legal consequences and injury to our reputation. Even if the other company makes us whole for financial losses, which is not necessarily the case, it is unlikely that it would be able to restore any injury to our reputation. As a result, the use of third parties to assist in our business activities heightens the risks to us inherent in those activities.\nOther Key Risks\nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse results in legal proceedings.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities. In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings \n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\n\n\nthey face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued often do not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate future losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 20 Legal Proceedings.\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services businesses and businesses with technologies or other assets valuable to us from time to time. Acquisitions present several risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nAcquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Many of the same risks arise when we engage in strategic partnerships. Our ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, may be limited to the extent that we cannot gather necessary or desirable information with respect to the business we are acquiring. We may also make certain assumptions related to an acquisition that may prove to be inaccurate that limit the anticipated benefits (such as cost savings from synergies or strategic gains from being able to offer enhanced product sets) or make the acquisition more expensive or take longer to complete and integrate than anticipated. Prior to closing an acquisition, prospective acquisition targets are also subject to their own risks that we cannot manage or control. Our ability to complete an acquisition may be dependent on regulatory agencies with responsibilities for reviewing or approving the transaction, which could delay, restrictively condition or result in denial of an acquisition, or otherwise limit the benefits of the acquisition. Changes in regulatory rules or standards or the application of those rules or standards, or future regulatory initiatives designed to promote competition or limit systemic risk and the potential for a financial institution to become “too big to fail,” may also limit our ability to complete an acquisition.\nAcquisition targets have their own risks specific to their businesses that could impact the success of an acquisition and its integration into PNC, such as:\n•If a significant aspect of the value of transaction is intellectual property, the extent to which the intellectual property may be utilized or protected and commercialized by PNC.\n•If the acquisition includes loan portfolios, the extent of actual credit losses and the required allowance for credit losses following completion of the acquisition.\n•If the acquisition involves entering into new businesses or geographic or other markets, potential limitations on our ability to take advantage of these opportunities because of our inexperience with respect to them.\n•The results of litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or that may be filed or commenced thereafter, because of an acquisition or otherwise, which are often hard to predict.\n•Operational or compliance issues at the acquisition target may not be fully identified or remediated until after the acquisition closes, potentially resulting in increased costs or penalties.\n•Models used by an acquisition target, such as for capital planning and credit loss accounting, may be designed or implemented in a manner different than at PNC, and our necessary reliance on these for a period of time, could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations to the extent that our estimates based on these models are inaccurate.\n•Enterprise risk management systems, policies and procedures may be different and less mature than those of PNC, and our necessary reliance on these for a period of time, could limit PNC’s ability to identify, monitor, manage and report risks or subject us to heightened regulatory, legal, operational or reputational risk.\nAfter closing, the success of an acquisition is likely partially dependent on our ability to retain and expand upon the acquired company’s customer base. It is also frequently subject to risks related to human capital, including, risks related to integrating the corporate culture of the acquired company and, to the extent being retained, the quality of leadership of the acquired company.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities, by international hostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities, terrorist activities, international hostilities or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control can be predicted. However, these occurrences could adversely impact us, for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course. Also, their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties could result in indirect adverse effects on us. Other indirect adverse consequences from these occurrences could result from impacts to the financial markets, the economy in general or in any region, or key parts of the infrastructure (such as the power grid) on which we and our customers rely. These types of indirect effects, whether specific to our counterparties or more generally applicable, could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2024 Form 10-K\n\ncould result in PNC experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. They could also cause a reduction in demand for lending or other services that we provide.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning. This includes our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that might occur. The adverse impact of these occurrences also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, many of which we depend on but have limited or no control over.",
