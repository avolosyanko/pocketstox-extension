      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe enable our customers to succeed in a digital world where technology decisions not only impact growth and competitiveness, but also directly impact enterprise risk. We were incorporated in 2007, during the early stages of cloud adoption and mobility, based on a vision that the internet would become the new corporate network, as the cloud became the new data center.\nWe correctly predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would fail to protect users and data, become prohibitively expensive and deliver poor user experience. Enterprises now rely on external software as a service, or SaaS, applications for critical business functions and have moved, or are moving, their internally managed applications to the public cloud infrastructure. As a result, users now expect to be able to seamlessly access applications and data, wherever they are hosted, from any device, anywhere in the world. The emergence and rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, or AI, is revolutionizing the transformational impact of cloud adoption and mobility. AI is fundamentally changing how organizations operate, creating new cybersecurity threats and IT challenges.\nOur cloud native, multitenant architecture is distributed across more than 160 public exchanges globally and thousands of private exchanges at the edge, which brings security and business policy close to users and devices in over 185 countries and provides fast, secure and reliable access. Each day, we block over 225 million threats and perform over 250,000 unique security updates. Our customers benefit from the cloud security effect of our ever-expanding ecosystem, enhanced by our advanced AI and ML capabilities, because once a new threat is detected, it can be blocked across our customer base within minutes.\nMany of the largest enterprises and government agencies in the world rely on our solutions to help them accelerate their move to the cloud. We have over 9,400 customers across all major geographies, with an emphasis on larger organizations, and we currently count approximately 40% of the Forbes Global 2000 and over 45% of Fortune 500 companies as customers. Our customers span every major industry, including financial services, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, automotive, airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, media and communications, public sector and education, energy, technology and telecommunications services. \nWe have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $1,617.0 million in fiscal 2023 to $2,167.8 million in fiscal 2024 to $2,673.1 million in fiscal 2025, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 34% and 23%, respectively. We experienced net losses of $41.5 million, $57.7 million and $202.3 million in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe pioneered a cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust ExchangeTM platform, which represented a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to networking and security that allows companies to securely accelerate their digital transformation initiatives.\nThe Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is a cloud-native platform, which implements Zero Trust principles to securely connect users, devices, applications and workloads, including AI agents, without relying on traditional hub-and-spoke network architecture and firewall-centric security. These technologies have become a roadblock to transformation for organizations that want to compete in today’s digital world. Firewalls and virtual private networks, or VPNs, create a perimeter around the corporate network and everything inside the perimeter is implicitly trusted. This is one of the root causes of ransomware attacks. Zscaler’s Zero Trust model operates on the principle that users, workloads, devices and AI \nAgents are untrusted by default, irrespective of the network they are connected to. This approach reduces the attack surface and prevents lateral threat movement, while improving business resilience. We believe that Zero Trust combined with AI is rapidly becoming the new foundation for enterprise security architectures. Zscaler is pioneering this convergence of Zero Trust + AI, enabling enterprises to embrace technologies in a manner that is more secure, more scalable, more resilient and increasingly adaptable to the modern world.\nOur ever-evolving platform provides our customers with a flexible and scalable approach to better secure their operations, optimize user experience, eliminate complexity, reduce costs and respond to the challenges and opportunities of AI and future new technologies. As the threat landscape evolves and companies look to further embrace AI and the cloud, our platform has evolved to focus on four core solutions: Zero Trust Everywhere, Data Security Everywhere, Security for AI and Agentic Operations.\n•Zero Trust Everywhere – extends the principles of Zero Trust across all locations – branches, campuses, cloud, factories, entities, users, workloads, IoT/OT systems and autonomous AI agents.\n•Data Security Everywhere – is Zscaler’s approach to safeguarding sensitive information across its entire lifecycle, from creation to storage, transmission and access, regardless of location, device or application.\n•Security for AI – allows organizations to securely embrace public and private AI applications.\n•Agentic Operations – refers to the integration of advanced AI technologies to empower both Security Operations, or SecOps, and IT Operations, or ITOps, teams with increased efficiency and actionable insights.\nZero Trust Everywhere\nOur Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform delivers our core Zero Trust Everywhere products through the deployment of our comprehensive and integrated solutions, each built natively in the cloud to power digital transformation.\nZero Trust Everywhere spans three core domains: Zero Trust Users, where users are never placed on the corporate network; Zero Trust Cloud, where workloads communicate only through the Exchange; and Zero Trust Branch, where branches, factories, warehouses, IoT/OT devices and autonomous AI agents are secured as independent entities and connected solely through policy-based access. Together, these capabilities deliver a unified Zero Trust architecture that replaces legacy firewalls, VPNs and SD-WANs with a model purpose-built for the modern enterprise.\nZero Trust Users\nPeople remain the weakest link in enterprise security. Compromised credentials, unmanaged devices and phishing attacks continue to be the entry point for many breaches. Zero Trust Users is designed to protect the workforce, third parties, business-to-business, or B2B, partners and suppliers by assuming no user is trusted by default. Every user – internal or external, on any device, from any location – must prove their identity, demonstrate a secure posture and meet policy requirements before being granted access to an application.\nThis approach eliminates the risks of putting users on a corporate network. Instead, users connect only to the specific applications they are authorized to use – whether SaaS, internet, AI applications or private applications hosted in data centers, clouds or factories. By removing the network path, threats cannot move laterally if a user is compromised. \nBy treating every user as untrusted, continuously analyzing risk and enforcing adaptive, per-session policies, Zero Trust Users reduces the likelihood of breaches, protects sensitive data and ensures a secure, reliable experience for everyone \naccessing enterprise applications and services. Zscaler delivers this functionality via the following core services: Zscaler Internet AccessTM, or ZIATM, Zscaler Private AccessTM, or ZPATM, and Zscaler Digital ExperienceTM, or ZDXTM. \nZscaler Internet Access\nZIA provides secure access to externally managed applications, including SaaS applications and internet destinations regardless of device, location or network. ZIA provides inline content inspection and firewall access controls across all ports and protocols to protect organizations and users from external threats, secure data in motion and prevent data from leaking out to unauthorized sites. Policies follow the user to provide identical protection on any device, regardless of location; any policy changes are enforced for users worldwide. Our inline cloud security platform assesses and correlates the risk of the content to protect against sophisticated attacks, including ransomware and phishing. The cloud platform applies AI and machine learning, or ML, across over 500 billion daily transactions to quickly identify and block unknown threats and to identify and categorize unknown destinations.\nZIA enables the following capabilities: \nCyberthreat Capabilities – Our holistic, future-ready threat defense functionality enables protection against threats using a range of approaches and techniques. Our threat prevention capabilities provide multiple layers of protection to prevent sophisticated ransomware, phishing and zero-day cyber attacks. Built on the principle of least privilege, our proxy architecture enables full Transport Layer Security, or TLS,/Secure Sockets Layer inspection at scale, with connections brokered between users and applications based on identity, context and business policies. We provide functionality that traditionally has been offered by disparate, stand-alone products. Our core cloud platform threat prevention capabilities include: \n•Advanced Threat Protection: Our advanced threat protection functionality uses techniques including AI/ML, advanced heuristics, signatures and reputation to deliver real-time protection from malicious internet content like browser exploits, scripts, zero-pixel iFrames, malware and botnet callbacks. Over 250,000 unique security updates are performed every day to the Zscaler cloud to keep organizations protected. Once we detect a new threat to a user, we block it for all users across all customers. We call this the “cloud security effect.”\n•Sandbox: Our cloud sandbox enables enterprises to block zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats by analyzing unknown files for malicious behavior, and it can scale to every user regardless of location. Our cloud sandbox was designed and built to be multi-tenant and allows customers, using AI, among other analytics, to determine which traffic should be sent for detonation. As an integrated cloud security platform, customers can set policies by users and destinations to prevent patient-zero scenarios and to analyze, hold and detonate suspicious files in the cloud sandbox before they are sent to a user. \n•Browser Isolation: Our cloud browser isolation functionality creates an isolated browsing session that enables users to access any webpage on the internet without downloading any of the web content served by the webpage onto a local device or the corporate network. With cloud browser isolation, users are not directly accessing active web content; instead, only a safe rendering of pixels is delivered to the user. Malicious code that may be hidden in the web content is kept at bay. Customers can select and isolate traffic based on specific policies and/or automatically based on our AI enabled risk determination. The combination of cloud browser isolation and cloud sandbox enables administrators to perform content disarm and reconstruction to flatten, sanitize and securely deliver files free of active content.\nZscaler Private Access\nZPA provides Zero Trust Network Access to secure access to internally managed applications, either hosted internally in data centers or hosted in private or public clouds. ZPA is designed around four key tenets that fundamentally change the way users access internal applications: \n•connect users to applications without bringing users on the network, preventing lateral movement; \n•never expose applications to the internet; \n•segment access to applications without relying on the traditional approach of network segmentation; and \n•provide remote access over the internet without VPNs.\nZPA leverages a global policy engine that governs access to internally managed applications regardless of location. If access is granted to a user, our ZPA solution connects the user’s device only to the authorized application without exposing the identity or location of the application. As a result, applications are not exposed to the internet, further limiting the external attack surface. This results in reduced cost and complexity, while offering better security and an improved user experience. \nOur ZPA solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by the following areas: \n•Cyberthreat Protection and Data Protection: Our ZPA solution delivers the same cyberthreat protection and data protection functionality that is applied to internet traffic via our ZIA solution.\n•Application Discovery: Similar to cloud access security broker, or CASB, application discovery reports for internet hosted SaaS applications, our ZPA solution provides granular discovery of internally managed applications to aid in the creation and oversight of segmentation policies. Because our ZPA solution sits on the application layer and is name-based or domain-based, organizations can quickly and seamlessly identify their internally-managed applications and then easily provision appropriate policies. \n•Secure Application Access: Since our ZPA solution delivers seamless connectivity to internally managed applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, enterprise data center or both, administrators can set global policies from a single console, enabling policy-driven access that is agnostic to the network the users are on. By creating seamless access to applications regardless of a user’s network, our ZPA solution eliminates the need for traditional remote access VPNs, reverse proxies and other similar products.\n•Application Segmentation: Our architecture provides capabilities that enable user and application level segmentation, a vast improvement over traditional network segmentation. As each user-to-application connection is segmented with microtunnels, each of which is a temporary session between a specific user and a specific application, lateral movement across the network is prevented, significantly reducing security risk. Since users are granted access only to applications for which they have permission and are not granted full access to the network, microtunnels eliminate the need for an internal firewall. \n•Application Protection: Our ZPA solution initiates outbound-only connections between authenticated users and internally managed applications using microtunnels. Access is provided to users without bringing them onto the corporate network and without exposing applications to the internet. Internally managed applications are not discoverable or identifiable. With no inbound connections and no public IP addresses, there is no inbound attack surface and therefore no threat of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. For allowed connections, our ZPA solution also provides Web Application Firewall functionality, including OWASP Top 10 protections for threats, such as Structured Query Language injection and cross-site scripting, to block common attack vectors. \n•Reduce Attack Surface: Our architecture utilizes inside out connections that are outbound from users to the Zero Trust Exchange platform, which allows customers to deny all inbound connections. This reduces their attack surface by not exposing IP addresses of all devices, applications, appliances or workloads to the internet. Reduced attack surface results in lower exposure to zero-day application vulnerabilities and eliminates the need for DDoS mitigation.\n•Browser Isolation: Our cloud browser isolation is used with our ZPA solution to provide isolated sessions to internal web applications without allowing data to transfer down to unmanaged devices or active content to be uploaded into sensitive internal applications. Combining cloud browser isolation with browser-based access provides a simplified, more cost-effective alternative to VDI for employees, contractors and B2B partners, by effectively keeping sensitive data off unmanaged devices. \nThe primary use cases for our ZPA solution include: \n•remote workforce access to private applications without legacy VPN, providing Zero Trust from office to data center; \n•deliver user-to-application segmentation, thus eliminating the risk of lateral threat propagation enabled by legacy Firewall and VPN based security architecture;\n•providing non-employees with secure access to internal applications; \n•securely connecting B2B customers, service providers and supplier access to applications typically deployed as B2B portals in an extranet; \n•direct-to-cloud access to internally managed applications hosted in public cloud environments, such as Azure, AWS and GCP; and \n•access to applications following a merger or acquisition by providing named users with access to named applications, without the need to merge networks.\nZscaler Digital Experience\nZDX is designed to measure end-to-end user experience across key business applications, providing an easy-to-understand digital experience score for each user, application and location within an enterprise. As users have become mobile and applications have moved to the cloud, traditional network performance monitoring tools have become increasingly irrelevant. Enterprises can no longer reliably collect performance metrics or indicators along the traditional network path as they could when they owned the network and applications ran in their own data centers. ZDX leverages advanced AI-enabled root cause analysis to proactively pinpoint issues in the network path, providing detailed insights into whether disruptions stem from a user’s device, WiFi connection, local internet, service provider or the destination application itself. With ZDX's expanded functionality, enterprises can now utilize predictive analytics to identify potential performance degradations before they impact end users, enabling faster remediation and minimizing downtime. Additionally, ZDX can easily differentiate localized issues – such as problems affecting a single user, application or location – from broader systemic issues impacting multiple users or locations, ensuring quicker and more focused responses. Administrators benefit from enhanced real-time monitoring and seamless integration into existing IT workflows, all via a simple visual interface that eliminates the need for additional hardware or software.\nZero Trust Cloud\nOur Zero Trust Cloud offers a comprehensive solution for securing customer workloads across hybrid environments, encompassing both public clouds and private data centers. This platform is built on a Zero Trust architecture, utilizing our \nZero Trust Exchange for centralized security policy enforcement and robust data protection. Zero Trust Cloud is designed to securely connect workloads and inspect all traffic, enabling the detection and mitigation of cyber threats like ransomware, preventing data loss and facilitating workload segmentation to halt the lateral movement of threats. This strategy aims to provide customers with consistent threat and data protection, eliminate the attack surface, reduce operational complexity and lower overall costs.\nOur Zero Trust Cloud solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by the following ideas:\n•Secure Workload to Internet: Our Zero Trust Cloud provides a solution for securing outbound communications from customer workloads to the internet. This capability is designed to protect workloads hosted in public clouds, private data centers or hybrid environments when they connect to external resources such as application programming interfaces, or APIs, SaaS platforms, third-party services or AI agents. Rather than trusting the underlying network, our Zero Trust model is founded on verifying the identity of the workload itself and enforcing granular access policies for any internet-bound request. To protect against cyber threats and data loss, the solution performs cloud-scale TLS inspection, which is designed to identify and block malicious attacks and prevent the unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data from our customers' cloud workloads. \n•Zero Trust Gateway: Zero Trust Gateway is a new deployment model for Zero Trust Cloud that dramatically improves operational efficiency. Customers can now rapidly deploy Zero Trust Cloud. Zero Trust Gateway, a fully managed Zscaler service available in the cloud service provider, allows customers to route traffic to Zscaler via an endpoint service using the most optimized path. This enables real-time inspection and filtering of traffic, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating threats. Zero Trust Cloud, deployed via Zero Trust Gateway, secures workload-to-internet and workload-to-workload traffic across multi-cloud environments, eliminating the need for traditional cloud firewalls, VPNs, express routes or direct connects.\n•Workload Microsegmentation: Our Workload Microsegmentation solution secures mission critical applications inside public clouds and data centers to stop lateral threat movement, preventing application compromise and reducing the risk of data breaches. Our agent-based offering solution utilizes an innovative, AI-enabled approach that is simpler to deploy and operate than traditional segmentation solutions, and improves the security of east-west communication by verifying the identity of the communicating application software, services and processes to achieve a Zero Trust environment. This reduces the attack surface, resulting in lower risk of application compromise and data breaches.\nZero Trust Branch\nOur Zero Trust Branch solution brings Zero Trust principles to secure communications between and within branches, factories, data centers and campuses. It reimagines branches as independent “café-like” environments, connecting directly to our Zero Trust Exchange over broadband, 5G or satellite. The network becomes pure transport, while business policies determine who can access what, when and where. With this model, branches become like islands and are invisible to the internet, dramatically reducing the attack surface and eliminating lateral threat movement. This eliminates the need for north-south firewalls, VPNs, network access control, or NAC, systems and costly routing infrastructure, sharply lowering complexity, risk and cost.\nLegacy branch architectures built on MPLS or legacy SD-WAN solutions inherently enable lateral movement, allowing compromised devices in one location to infect applications and systems across the corporate network. This model creates unnecessary cyber risk and adds costly complexity. Zero Trust Branch neutralizes that risk by eliminating implicit trust and lateral movement, stopping ransomware and malware spread.\nOur Zero Trust Branch solution includes broad functionality, which we categorize by the following ideas:\n•Zero Trust SD-WAN: Our Zero Trust SD-WAN solution provides branches and data centers with fast, reliable access to the internet and private applications with our Direct-to-CloudTM architecture that provides strong security and operational simplicity, with the ability to deploy locally by virtual machine or by purchasing a plug-and-play appliance. Our Zero Trust SD-WAN solution eliminates lateral threat movement by connecting users and IoT/OT devices to applications through our Zero Trust Exchange platform. Branch traffic can be securely forwarded directly to the Zero Trust Exchange, where ZIA or ZPA policies can be applied for full security inspection and access identity-based control of branch and data center communications.\n•Zero Trust Device Segmentation: Our Zero Trust Device Segmentation solution provides agentless segmentation for enterprise IT and OT environments, creating a \"network of one\" where even devices on the same network can only communicate with each other if authorized. The combination of Zero Trust SD-WAN with Zero Trust Device Segmentation extends the Zero Trust Exchange platform to protect east-west traffic in branch offices, campuses, factories and plants with critical OT infrastructure, eliminating the need for east-west firewalls, NACs and traditional microsegmentation solutions, while simultaneously delivering operational simplicity.\nData Security Everywhere\nOur data security functionality enables enterprises to prevent unauthorized sharing or exfiltration of confidential information by users, devices, servers, workloads and AI agents, thereby reducing business and compliance risks for our customers. We provide inline monitoring of data flows between users and applications, workload to workload, API to API and applications to LLMs with AI-powered auto data discovery, reducing the risk of inadvertently transmitting sensitive data and intellectual property. We also provide out-of-band discovery and remediation of data risks across a wide range of data stores, including SaaS, IaaS/PaaS, cloud data lakes and warehouses and on-prem systems. Core cloud platform data security services include:\n•Advanced AI-Powered Data Classification: Our data classification engines leverage a variety of technologies and techniques to identify customer sensitive data. Predefined, custom dictionaries and automated AI discovery tools identify sensitive customer data by leveraging efficient pattern-matching algorithms, regular expressions, AI-based training models and keywords. Additional advanced classification techniques, including exact data match, indexed document matching and ML-based optical character recognition, enable our customers to identify and secure sensitive data across billions of unique structured data fields.\n•Enterprise Data Loss Prevention: Our data loss prevention, or DLP, technology enables enterprises to alert and/or block transmission or sharing of sensitive data across exfiltration channels. This includes inline data in motion to external internet destinations and unmanaged endpoints, data at rest in SaaS environments through out-of-band API integrations, securing public cloud infrastructure data in Azure, AWS and GCP and protecting endpoints by preventing printing or copying to local storage, including USB devices. Additionally, our Email DLP solutions secure corporate email traffic, including Microsoft Exchange and Gmail.\n•Unified SaaS Security: Our CASB, SaaS security posture management, or SSPM, and our SaaS supply chain security combine to discover and control known and unknown applications, identify SaaS misconfigurations, find and mitigate potentially risky third-party connections into those SaaS applications and scan data residing in those applications for threats and data protection violations. By doing TLS inspection at scale, we provide malware protection, DLP and CASB functions that can be performed both inline and out-of-band, for specific sanctioned and unsanctioned applications. Business policies can be defined with granular access control for specified cloud applications, such as the ability to upload or download files or post comments on videos based on different user or group identity.\n•Email Security: Our email security solution leverages advanced cloud-delivered protections to secure inbound and outbound email traffic against sophisticated threats, such as phishing, malware and ransomware. Integrated with our Zero Trust Exchange platform, it ensures comprehensive inspection and policy enforcement without relying on traditional email gateways. The solution employs AI and ML to detect and block malicious payloads, suspicious links and compromised accounts in real time. Additionally, this solution enhances DLP by identifying and mitigating risks associated with sensitive information being shared via email. \n•Data Security Posture Management: Our Data Security Posture Management, or DSPM, technology enables enterprises to discover and mitigate risk across their vast range of data stores – including public cloud, SaaS, data lakes and warehouses and on-premise data systems. Advanced classification and contextual analysis enables enterprises to understand where sensitive data resides, and to uncover risks related to posture configuration, access entitlements or compliance. Automated workflows enable organizations to remediate these risks, integrating with mainstream IT Service Management tools such as Service Now and Jira. The solution empowers organizations to proactively remediate data risks and avoid sensitive data exposures or compliance violations. \nSecurity for AI\nThe emergence of generative AI models is fundamentally transforming businesses, as enterprises and their stakeholders have rapidly embraced this new technology. Enterprises are adopting public GenAI SaaS applications, such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini and others, and are also investing to develop their private AI applications, such as customer-facing, employee-facing or supplier-facing chatbots and agents. This growing adoption of AI is leading to an emergence of a new category of risks that go beyond traditional cyber and data risks, including prompt injection, toxicity, training data leakage, model poisoning, tool poisoning and other risks. To enable our customers to safely and securely adopt these public and private AI applications, we are expanding our Security for AI Applications portfolio. \nSecurity for Public AI Applications – Public GenAI SaaS applications can improve employee productivity, however they also present new risks for organizations, such as data loss and unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information. Zscaler’s Public AI security solutions give visibility, provide access control, protect sensitive information leakage and defend against emerging adversarial attacks. Our solutions for public AI applications include:\n•GenAI Security: Our GenAI security offerings provide enterprises with comprehensive visibility and control over generative AI tool usage to prevent data loss while enabling productivity benefits.

It uses AI-generated decoy information to mislead and neutralize potential threats, safeguarding critical organizational assets.\nAgentic Operations\nSecurity Operations\nReducing cyber risk is a priority for all enterprises, especially at the executive and board of directors level, making holistic security operations a key area of focus for our customers. Our security operations solutions include both proactive security initiatives, focused on identifying security gaps before they can be exploited, and reactive security programs, centered on finding and containing incidents after they happen. These solutions include broad and differentiated capabilities in both domains and are categorized into the following areas:\nProactive Security Operations\nExposure Management – Zscaler’s exposure management platform ingests and analyzes a wide range of exposure intelligence sources to deliver a comprehensive view of organizational risk. It integrates data from Zscaler systems, such as our Zero Trust Exchange platform, and third-party data from more than 150 sources including: vulnerability scans; misconfigurations; shadow IT discovery and unmanaged devices (including IoT/OT); security information and event management, or SIEMs; security orchestration, automation and response systems; endpoint protection platforms; and global threat intelligence feeds. It also integrates contextual data such as asset criticality, business impact and user behavior. Our Data Fabric for Security ingests, synthesizes and enriches this data to yield compelling insights for exposure management by security teams. Our exposure management platform includes:\n•Unified Vulnerability Management: Our unified vulnerability management solution provides dynamic and customizable prioritization, streamlined reporting, automated workflows for remediation and contextualized risk-based assessments of a customer’s risk landscape. This solution leverages our Data Fabric for Security to deliver actionable insights, prioritized risk analysis and operational efficiencies.

By continuously monitoring all assets – whether hosted on-premises, in the cloud or within hybrid environments – our solution helps uncover shadow IT, misconfigurations, unpatched systems and other hidden risks. This solution leverages our Data Fabric for Security to provide advanced analytics and automation, \nprioritize critical exposures based on business impact and threat likelihood and empower organizations to proactively reduce their attack surface and strengthen their overall security posture. This approach aligns with our commitment to providing comprehensive, scalable solutions that help customers minimize risk in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.\nReactive Security Operations\nThreat Management – Zscaler delivers advanced capabilities including deception technologies, identity threat detection and managed detection and response. Our acquisition of Red Canary, Inc, or Red Canary, strengthens this portfolio with its agentic AI-driven threat detection that autonomously reduces alert fatigue, hunts threats and delivers faster, more accurate incident containment. We will integrate these advanced SOC capabilities with our Data Fabric for Security, enabling more robust SOC capabilities over time and helping customers reduce or eliminate their dependence on costly legacy SIEM systems. Our threat management offerings include:\n•Deception: Our deception solution augments our customers’ ability to detect the presence of an adversary in their network by deploying decoys. These decoys disrupt adversaries by detecting their presence in the network and initiating mitigation using automatic orchestration via the Zscaler platform and other third-party solutions. Customers can quickly deploy these capabilities by leveraging a diverse library of built-in decoys including various types of applications, network components and IoT services. The high-fidelity low-volume alerts allow customers to implement meaningful automation workflows to prevent lateral spread.\n•Red Canary Managed Detection and Response: Our Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service offering, added through our acquisition of Red Canary, provides threat detection and on-demand incident response services to augment our customers’ security operations capabilities and reduce reliance on extensive internal resources or specialized expertise. This capability leverages advanced technologies including agentic workflows, AI-supported threat intelligence, expert analysis and automated runbooks to identify and address complex cybersecurity threats. \n•Identity Protection: Attackers commonly target users and identities as the point of entry and use that access to escalate privileges and move laterally. Our Identity Protection capability provides continuous visibility into identity misconfigurations and at-risk permissions by scanning common identity providers. Identity Protection augments this visibility with guidance in the form of scripts, commands and tutorials to remediate identity risk and reduce customers’ internal attack surface. In addition to preventive capabilities, Identity Protection also provides high-fidelity detection for identity-based attacks like stolen credentials, multi-factor authentication bypasses and privilege escalation techniques that typically pass through existing defenses in cases of identity compromise.\nAgentic IT Operations\nZscaler is also extending Agentic Operations to IT through our ZDX product. Traditional IT operations depend on siloed monitoring tools that provide limited visibility and require manual troubleshooting across networks, devices and applications. These limitations result in long ticket resolution times, frustrated users and higher operating costs. With ZDX's expanded functionality, enterprises can now utilize predictive analytics to identify potential performance degradations before they impact end users, enabling faster remediation and minimizing downtime. ZDX leverages advanced AI-enabled root cause analysis to proactively pinpoint issues in the network path, providing detailed insights into whether disruptions stem from a user’s device, WiFi connection, local internet, service provider or the destination application itself. It also leverages AI-driven automation to deliver end-to-end visibility into user experience, network performance and application health. With agentic remediation capabilities, ZDX can detect endpoint issues, resolve tickets and proactively improve performance without human intervention. For example, ZDX can identify device misconfigurations, degraded application paths or network bottlenecks, and automatically correct them, reducing resolution time, avoiding downtime and creating a better user experience. \nBy transforming IT operations from reactive to proactive, ZDX enables enterprises to improve user productivity and satisfaction, reduce IT operations cost and deliver consistent digital experiences at global scale.\nOur Technology and Architecture\nWe are driven by technology and innovation. We developed a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection of internet and SasS traffic, securing access to private applications, protecting cloud applications, managing digital experience and scanning for exposures and misconfigurations. We designed a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with our core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Our cloud platform is protected by more than 725 issued and pending patents in the United States and other countries. Our cloud is distributed across more than 160 public exchanges globally and thousands of private exchanges at the edge, and processes over 500 billion requests per day from users across over 185 countries. \nOur platform is designed to be resilient, redundant and high-performing. It is built as software modules that run on standard x86 platforms without dependency on custom hardware. The platform modules are split into the control plane (Zscaler Central Authority), the enforcement plane (Zscaler Enforcement Nodes) and the logging and statistics plane (Zscaler Log Servers) as described below:\n•Zscaler Central Authority: The Zscaler Central Authority monitors our entire security cloud and provides a central location for software and database updates, policy and configuration settings and threat intelligence. The collection of Zscaler Central Authority instances together act like the brain of the cloud, and they are geographically distributed for redundancy and performance.\n•Zscaler Enforcement Nodes: Customer traffic is directed to the nearest Zscaler Enforcement Node, where security, management and compliance policies served by the Zscaler Central Authority are enforced. The Zscaler Enforcement Node also incorporates our differentiated authentication and policy distribution mechanism that enables any user to connect to any Zscaler Enforcement Node at any time to ensure full policy enforcement. The Zscaler Enforcement Node utilizes a full proxy architecture and is built to ensure data is not written to disk to maintain the highest level of data security. Data is scanned in random-access memory only and then erased. Logs are continuously created in memory and forwarded to our logging module. \n•Zscaler Log Servers: Our technology is built into the Zscaler Enforcement Node to perform lossless compression of logs, enabling our platform to collect over 130 terabytes of unique raw log data every day. We do not collect customer data other than logs, and those logs are encrypted and transmitted to our log server at a destination of choice selected by the customer without ever writing to disk at the enforcement nodes. Logs are transmitted to our logging servers over secure connections and multicast to multiple servers for redundancy. Our dashboards provide our customers visibility into their traffic to enable troubleshooting, policy changes and other administrative actions. Our analytics capabilities allow customers to interactively mine billions of transaction logs to generate reports that provide insight on network utilization and traffic. We do not rely on batch reporting; we continuously update our dashboards and reporting and can stream logs to a third-party SIEM service as they arrive. Regardless of where users are located, customers can choose to have logs stored in the United States or the European Union/Switzerland. Customer data is isolated as part of our multi-tenant architecture. \n•Data Fabric for Security: Our Data Fabric for Security capabilities empower organizations to seamlessly integrate, analyze and act on security data across distributed environments. By unifying data from user activity, applications, devices and workloads across on-premises, cloud and hybrid networks, our platform provides real-time visibility into potential threats and vulnerabilities. This interconnected “fabric” enables security teams to break down silos, correlate insights from multiple sources and make proactive, data-driven decisions to mitigate risks. With advanced automation and AI-driven analytics, our Data Fabric for Security transforms raw security data into actionable \nintelligence, helping organizations respond faster to incidents, comply with regulatory requirements and maintain a robust security posture across their increasingly complex IT ecosystems.\nOur platform is a critical integration point positioned in the data path providing secure access to the internet, cloud and internal applications. We complement and interoperate with key technology and cloud vendors across major market segments, including identity and access management device and endpoint management, as well as SIEM for reporting and analytics. Many of these vendors, like us, were developed in the cloud and together provide a foundation for a modern access and security architecture. \nGrowth Strategies \nThe growing use of the internet and the increasing adoption of the cloud and mobility are driving network and application transformation. As a provider of a fully integrated, multi-tenant cloud security solution, we enable our customers to accelerate this secure transformation to the cloud and believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize value as they undertake these transitions. Key elements of our growth strategy include: \n•Continue to win new customers. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our customer base, both in the United States and internationally. We have invested significantly in our sales and marketing organization to execute against this opportunity. \n•Expansion in existing customers. We leverage a land-and-expand approach with our existing customers to sell subscriptions for additional users, additional solutions and premium solution bundles that contain more functionality.\n•Leverage channel partners to participate in cloud transformation initiatives. We have invested in establishing long-standing relationships with global telecommunications service providers and are expanding our network of global system integrators and regional telecommunications service providers and cloud-centric value-added resellers and public cloud marketplaces.\n•Expansion and innovation of services. We continue to invest in research and development and acquire new technologies and products to add new and differentiated solutions to our existing product portfolio and to improve the overall functionality, reliability, availability and scalability of our cloud security platform.\n•Expansion into additional market segments. We are targeting the expansion of our immediate addressable market into additional markets, segments and verticals. For example, we are targeting our expansion into new geographies in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East regions.\nWe sell to enterprises of all sizes. As of July 31, 2025, we had over 9,400 customers, including approximately 40% of the Forbes Global 2000 and over 45% of Fortune 500 companies. Many of our customers include major global enterprises that send virtually all of their internet traffic through our cloud security platform. Our customers operate in a variety of industries, including automotive, airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, energy, financial services, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services. Approximately 49% of our revenue was from customers outside the United States for all periods presented. No end customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\nSales and Marketing\nAlthough we have a channel sales model, we use a joint sales approach in which our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. Our customer care and success teams maintain high-touch relationships with our customers to deploy and manage our cloud platform, identify, analyze and resolve performance issues and respond to security threats. We believe customer service touchpoints are opportunities to further develop our relationship with our customers and potentially generate incremental revenue through the addition of new users and services. \nOur channel partners consist of global telecommunications service providers, system integrators, value-added reseller partners and public cloud marketplaces, and we leverage their relationships to expand our reach, improve procurement and accelerate customer fulfillment. \nWe enter into agreements with our channel partners in the ordinary course of business. The contracts typically have a one-year term and renew automatically, subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, warranties and indemnification. Our channel partners generally place purchase orders with us after receiving orders from customers. We generally maintain privity of contract with customers through end user subscription agreements. \nWe expect to continue investing in our channel partners as we provide them with education, training and programs, including supporting their independent sales of our solutions. We believe that such investment, and investments in our sales force, will lead to significant expansion in our customer base, which will materially impact our business and results of operations. \nOur marketing strategy is focused on platform and brand awareness, which drives our opportunity pipeline and customer demand. This strategy is account-based, enabling us to pursue targeted marketing activities across both digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs designed to elevate our brand in the market and engage new enterprise accounts. We also participate in a number of cloud and security industry events. In addition, we have a deeply integrated ecosystem of channel partners, with whom we engage in joint marketing activities.\nData Center Operations \nWe have expanded the Zero Trust Exchange over 160 public exchanges and thousands of private exchanges at the edge, which are built to be highly resilient, have multiple levels of redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. Our data centers are co-located within top-tier internet interconnection hubs that have direct connectivity, known as peering, to major telecommunication service providers, SaaS providers, public cloud providers, internet content providers and popular internet destinations. A number of our data centers are also located with our service provider partners. \nCompliance \nOur platform has received numerous industry standard and internationally recognized certifications upon successful completion of further independent third-party assessments, including ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27018, ISO 27017, SOC2, SOC 3 CSA-STAR and HIPAA.\nWe also built a leading U.S. and international government compliance portfolio. We are authorized at the FedRAMP Moderate and High levels and Impact Level 5 with the DOD for ZPA. In addition, in the U.S. we are authorized at both the FedRAMP Moderate and High levels for ZIA, among others. We also hold CMMC Level 2 certification, ITAR, FIPS, CJIS \nand VPAT 508 in our U.S. Government portfolio. We also became the first cloud-based SaaS security company to achieve StateRamp for state and local governments. Internationally, we are IRAP Protected and APRA in Australia, Cyber Essentials and G-Cloud in the UK, C5 in Germany, ITSG-33 Prob B in Canada, ISMAP in Japan, MTCS in Singapore and, most recently, Spain Gov CPSTIC catalog listing and ENS-High.\nResearch and Development \nOur research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, operation and quality of our cloud platform. In addition to improving on our features and functionality, this organization works closely with our cloud operations team to ensure that our platform is reliable, available and scalable. ThreatLabZ, our internal team of security experts, researchers and network engineers, analyzes the global threat landscape, works to eliminate threats across our cloud platform and reports on emerging security issues. \nResearch and development expense was $672.5 million, $499.8 million and $350.8 million for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Our research and development leadership team is predominantly located in San Jose, California, and we also maintain research and development centers internationally, including in India, Canada, Israel and Spain. \nCompetition \nThe market for security solutions is defined by changing technologies, an evolving threat landscape and complex enterprise needs. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy on-premises appliance vendors and other vendors across a number of categories: \n•independent IT security vendors, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; \n•large networking and other vendors, which offer security appliances and/or incorporate security capabilities in their networking products and other services;\n•companies with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, CASB, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, AI security, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and \n•other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. \nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include: \n•delivering security from the cloud regardless of location of the user; \n•platform features, effectiveness and extensibility; \n•platform reliability, availability and scalability; \n•rapid development and delivery of new capabilities and services; \n•ability to integrate with other participants in the security and networking ecosystem; \n•price, total cost of ownership and network cost savings; \n•brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; \n•strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships; and \n•quality of customer support. \nWe believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. Our cloud platform integrates many of the point products offered by our competitors and potential competitors, which is a key differentiator. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, product bundling or maintaining closed technology platforms. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based network security architecture and may not be willing or ready to abandon those historical investments. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services. In addition, we may expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. \nIntellectual Property \nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2025, we had more than 725 issued patents and pending patent applications, including more than 325 issued patents in the United States and other countries. Our issued patents expire between 2028 and 2044 and cover various aspects of our cloud platform. In addition, we have registered “Zscaler” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we have registered other trademarks and filed other trademark applications in the United States. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Zscaler” and similar variations. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our subscription and license agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition to our internally developed technology, we also license software, including open source software, from third parties that we integrate into or bundle with our cloud platform. \nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. In particular, companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies and non-practicing entities, have in the past and may in the future, assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, with whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” for additional information. \nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, privacy, employment, labor and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital \nAs of July 31, 2025, we had a total of 7,923 employees in locations around the world. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive and collaborative.\nZscaler's vision is to create a world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless. Specifically, ensuring that our people and culture are aligned with this vision is critical to our success. In order to continue to innovate and to execute our business strategy, we must attract, develop and retain skilled employees, particularly in the areas of product development, engineering, sales and customer success.\nOur Culture\nOur culture is about creating an environment where our global workforce can contribute their best work to help our customers and our business succeed. Zscaler's cultural values are: \n•Teamwork\n•Ownership\n•Passion\n•Innovation\n•Customer Obsession\nWe build this culture through the feedback we receive from our employees through company-wide surveys as well as informal feedback channels throughout the year. We ultimately view and measure the success of our culture by our ability to sustain great business results. \nEmployee Development\nWe invest in our employees through a suite of programs from their first day of employment to develop their talent and skills as our business grows. Our leadership approach establishes clear expectations, enables measurement and actionable feedback and ensures that our people managers have access to learning and resources that help them to embody our leadership principles.\nIn addition, new employees in our customer care and success teams are enrolled in structured sales and product training to build their knowledge. Our technical teams have access to live and online training resources and participate in frequent company tech talks where training on best practices and latest developments are shared. We build the skills and capabilities of our senior leaders through intentional investment in their development and opportunities for them to network, collaborate and problem solve together. \nTo supplement our internal resources, we work with external experts to offer focused development for our leaders, as well as targeted offerings on topics that are critical to enhancing the capabilities of our talent. We offer tuition reimbursement for eligible employees to further enhance their career growth through higher education.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain our talent. In addition to base pay, employees may be eligible for performance based bonuses that are tied to our financial performance and long-term equity incentives that vest subject to continued service. Certain employees may also need to achieve defined performance metrics for parts of their long-term incentives to vest. Our employee performance management program aligns individual achievement and corporate goal attainment with compensation. Employees are assessed on both what was achieved and how they achieved it to help build a high-performance culture that delivers for our customers and is aligned to our cultural values.\nWe offer an employee stock purchase plan, which allows employees to contribute a percentage of their wages to purchase our stock at a discount. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer our employees a robust portfolio of benefits, such as health, well-being, parental leave and retirement programs, to meet their individual and family needs.\nHealth, Safety and Well-being\nThe health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We recognize the need to create a flexible working environment that balances collaboration, innovation and connectivity with personal preferences for employees to do their best work. Our employee wellness programs support employees across four pillars: physical, emotional, social and financial. These programs are designed to meet the needs of our employees through connection and support, with flexibility for local and targeted approaches. We will continue to review and invest in programs to provide for the health, safety and well-being of our employees.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware in September 2007 as SafeChannel, Inc., and in August 2008, we changed our name to Zscaler, Inc.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as more fully described in this section below this summary. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our common stock risky include, among others:\n•we have a history of annual net losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future;\n•if organizations do not adopt our cloud platform, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected;\n•if we are unable to attract new customers or our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services and add additional users and services to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed;\n•we face intense and increasing competition and could lose market share to our competitors;\n•we have experienced rapid revenue and other growth in recent periods, which may not be indicative of our future performance;\n•our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations;\n•if the delivery of our services to our customers is interrupted or delayed for any reason, our business would suffer;\n•the actual or perceived failure of our cloud platform to block malware or prevent a security breach or incident could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business;\n•our business and growth depend in part on the success of our relationships with our channel partners;\n•if our cloud platform or internal networks, systems or data are or are perceived to have been breached, our solution may be perceived as insecure, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively impacted;\n•we rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business;\n•claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business;\n•if we are unable to effectively manage certain risks and challenges related to our India operations, our business could be harmed; \n•servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business or the ability to raise funds to pay our substantial debt; and\n•the impact of global economic disruptions and changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions remains uncertain and may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Growth\nWe have a history of annual net losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in all annual periods since our inception, and we expect we will continue to incur annual net losses for the foreseeable future. We experienced net losses of $41.5 million, $57.7 million and $202.3 million for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. As of July 31, 2025, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,189.6 million. Because the market for our cloud platform is rapidly evolving and cloud-based security solutions have not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we continue to hire additional personnel, particularly in research and development and sales and marketing, expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, and continue to develop our platform. If we fail to increase our revenue to offset the increases in our operating expenses, we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nAdditionally, our business strategy continues to focus primarily on long-term growth. As we execute on this strategy, we may ultimately be unable to achieve or sustain profitability at the level contemplated by industry or financial analysts and our stockholders, or at all, and as a result, our stock price may decline.\nIf organizations do not adopt our cloud platform, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nCloud security technologies are still evolving, and it remains difficult to predict customer demand and adoption rates for our solutions. We believe that our cloud platform offers superior protection to our customers, who are moving their applications and data to the cloud and embracing AI applications and agents. We also believe that our cloud platform represents a major shift from on-premises appliance-based security solutions. While cloud-based security solutions have seen increased adoption, traditional on-premises security appliances continue to be entrenched in the infrastructure of many of our potential customers, particularly large enterprises, because of their prior investment in and the familiarity of their IT personnel with on-premises appliance-based solutions. As a result, our sales process often involves extensive efforts to educate our customers on the benefits and capabilities of our cloud platform, particularly as we continue to pursue customer relationships with large organizations. Even with these efforts, we cannot predict long-term market acceptance of our cloud platform, or the adoption of competing products, services or technologies. If we fail to achieve broad market acceptance of our cloud platform or are unable to keep pace with industry changes, our ability to grow our business and our operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed.\nTo increase our revenue and achieve and maintain profitability, we must add new customers. To add new customers, we must successfully convince IT decision makers that security delivered through our cloud platform provides significant advantages over legacy on-premises appliance-based security products and competing cloud-based products. Additionally, many of our customers broadly deploy our products, which requires a significant commitment of resources from our customers. These factors significantly impact our ability to add new customers and increase the time, resources and sophistication required to do so. \nIn addition, numerous other factors, many of which are out of our control, have impacted and may in the future impact our ability to add new customers, including:\n•potential customers’ commitments to legacy IT security vendors and products; \n•real or perceived switching costs; \n•the current or potential implementation of tariffs or retaliatory measures due to tariffs on the sales of our products in countries where our customers or potential paying customers are located; \n•competition from hybrid or cloud security products; \n•our failure to expand, retain and motivate our sales and marketing personnel; \n•our failure to develop or expand relationships with our channel partners or to attract new channel partners; \n•failure by us or our partners to help our customers to successfully deploy our cloud platform; \n•negative media or industry or financial analyst commentary regarding us or our solutions, or similar solutions offered by other vendors; \n•litigation; and \n•general economic conditions.\nAs a result of challenging or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we have experienced and may experience in the future increased scrutiny and a longer approval process for initial purchases by new customers, particularly for larger transactions. We cannot predict how challenging or uncertain macroeconomic conditions will impact potential customers' purchasing decisions and whether potential customers may decide to delay purchases, decrease the size of purchases or entirely forego purchasing our services. \nIf our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue and rate of revenue growth may decline, we may not achieve profitability and our future results of operations could be materially harmed. \nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services and add additional users and services to their subscriptions, our future results of operations could be harmed.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions for our services when existing contract terms expire, and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically one to three years, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, in certain cases, including under the new EU Data Act, customers may cancel their subscriptions without cause either at any time or upon advance written notice (commonly ranging from 30 days to 60 days), typically subject to an early termination penalty for unused services. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer users, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to a lower-cost product suite. If our customers do not renew their subscription services, we could incur impairment losses related to our deferred contract acquisition costs. It is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention because of our varied customer base and given the length of our subscription contracts. Our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our services, our prices and pricing plans, our customers’ spending levels, decreases in the number of users to which our customers deploy our solutions, new laws and regulations impacting service contract terms, mergers and \nacquisitions involving our customers, competition and deteriorating or uncertain general economic conditions, which may result in reductions in IT budgets and lower employee headcounts. \nOur future success also depends in part on the rate at which our current customers add additional users or services to their subscriptions, which is driven by a number of factors, including customer satisfaction with our services, customer security and networking issues and requirements, general economic conditions and customer reaction to the price per additional user or of additional services. If our efforts to expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our business may materially suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid revenue and other growth in recent periods, which may not be indicative of our future performance. \nWe have experienced rapid growth in revenue, operations and employee headcount in recent periods. In addition, the number of customers, users and internet traffic on our cloud platform has increased rapidly in recent years. Our growth may not be sustainable and may not be sufficient to achieve and sustain profitability, as we also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we expand our operations and significantly increase our headcount. In addition, we expect our recent revenue growth rates will decline in the future as the size of our revenue base increases. As a result, we believe that historical comparisons of our revenue may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Accordingly, you should not rely on our revenue and other growth for any prior quarter or fiscal year as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, adequately address competitive challenges or maintain our corporate culture, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively, which will require that we continue to improve our administrative, operational, financial and management systems and controls by, among other things:\n•effectively attracting, retaining, training and integrating, including collaborating with, a large number of new employees; \n•further improving our key business applications, processes and IT infrastructure, including through the use of AI, to support our business needs; \n•enhancing our information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of channel partners, customers and users; and \n•appropriately documenting and testing our IT systems and business processes. \nThese and other improvements in our systems and controls will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of our cloud platform and key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies could be impaired, the quality of our platform and services could suffer and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture has been a contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork and an emphasis on customer-focused results. We also believe that our culture creates an environment \nthat drives and perpetuates our strategy and cost-effective distribution approach. In the past we have, and in the future we may, restructure or reduce our workforce to align people, roles and projects to our strategic priorities. Any restructuring, reduction or realignment in the workforce has the potential to negatively impact employee morale or make it more difficult to attract and retain talent. As we continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Preservation of our corporate culture is also made more difficult following the implementation of our hybrid work environment, and many of our employees continue to work from home on a full time or part time basis. Any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy. If we experience any of these effects in connection with future growth, it could materially impair our ability to attract new customers, support and retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. Some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n•broad market acceptance and the level of demand for our cloud platform; \n•our ability to attract new customers, particularly large enterprises; \n•our ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our platform, particularly our largest customers; \n•our ability to successfully expand internationally and penetrate key markets; \n•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs; \n•the length of our sales cycle;\n•the timing and availability of renewals; \n•the mix of billings among monthly in advance, quarterly in advance, annually in advance and multi-year in advance;\n•technological changes and the timing and success of new service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market; \n•increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive; \n•pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise; \n•seasonal buying patterns for IT spending, including the possible slowdown in IT spending due to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment;\n•the quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan; \n•reputational harm as a result of actual, perceived or purported technological failure or disruption;\n•adverse litigation judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs; \n•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment; \n•the impact and costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property rights; \n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and \n•general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, including as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical events, developments and conditions.\nAny one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We also intend to continue to invest significantly to grow our business in the near future rather than optimizing for profitability or cash flows. In addition, we generally experience seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the second half of our fiscal year. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription, which is generally one to three years. We expect that seasonality will continue to affect our operating results in the future and may reduce our ability to predict cash flow and optimize the timing of our operating expenses.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of industry or financial analysts. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nOur business and growth depend in part on the success of our relationships with our channel partners. \nWe currently derive most of our revenue from sales through our channel partner network, and we expect for the foreseeable future most of our future revenue growth will also be driven through this network. Not only does our joint sales approach require additional investment to grow and train our sales force, but we believe that continued growth in our business is dependent upon identifying, developing and maintaining strategic relationships with our existing and potential channel partners, including global systems integrators and regional telecommunications service providers that will in turn drive substantial revenue and provide additional value-added services to our customers. Our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with our cloud platform. Our channel partners may also cease marketing or reselling our platform with limited or no notice and without penalty. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell subscriptions to our cloud platform, choose to promote our competitors’ products or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell subscriptions to our cloud platform may be adversely affected. For example, sales through our top five channel partners and their affiliates, in aggregate, represented 28% of our revenue for fiscal 2025, 25% of our revenue for fiscal 2024 and 26% of our revenue for fiscal 2023. In addition, our channel partner structure could subject us to lawsuits or reputational harm if, for example, a channel partner misrepresents the functionality of our cloud platform to customers or violates applicable laws or our corporate policies. Moreover, our channel partners' operations may be negatively impacted by events including pandemics, international conflicts, trade regulations including tariffs, inflation and other events affecting the global economy in general. For example, these events could increase credit risk of end customers and create uncertainty in credit markets. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners, identifying additional channel partners and training our channel partners to independently sell and deploy our platform. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our existing channel partners or develop successful relationships with new channel partners or if our channel partners fail to perform, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services\nWe face intense and increasing competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for network security solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services and improvements of existing products and services. We compete with many established network and security vendors who are aggressively competing against us with their legacy appliance-based solutions and have also introduced cloud-based services that purport to have functionality similar to our cloud platform. We are also experiencing increased competition as other established and emerging companies enter the cloud-based security solutions market and introduce new products, services and technologies to address evolving customer requirements. If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenue or our growth rate that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur competitors and potential competitors include:\n•independent IT security vendors, which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products;\n•large networking and other vendors, which offer security appliances and/or incorporate security capabilities in their networking products and other services;\n•companies with point solutions that compete with some of the features of our cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, CASB, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, AI security, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing and VPN; and \n•other providers of IT security services that offer, or may leverage related technologies to introduce, products that compete with or are alternatives to our cloud platform. \nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n•greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger customer bases; \n•larger sales and marketing budgets and resources; \n•broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and customers; \n•greater customer support resources; \n•greater resources to make acquisitions and enter into strategic partnerships; \n•lower labor and research and development costs; \n•larger and more mature intellectual property rights portfolios; and \n•substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. \nOur competitors may be successful in convincing IT decision makers that legacy appliance-based security products or hybrid security cloud solutions based on legacy technology are sufficient to meet their security needs and provide security performance that competes with our cloud platform. In addition, our competitors have and may develop cloud-based solutions with architectures similar to our products. Further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their appliance-based networks and have established deep relationships with appliance \nvendors. As a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier.\nOur larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings, which may allow them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our services, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering free services and other concessions, bundling products or maintaining closed technology platforms. Many competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat may be able to deliver these targeted security products to the market more quickly than we can or to convince organizations that these limited products meet their needs.\nConditions in our market change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. Start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may introduce similar or superior products, services and technologies that compete with our cloud platform. In addition, large companies with substantial communications infrastructure, such as global telecommunications services provider partners or public cloud providers, have entered or could choose to enter the security solutions market. Some of our current or potential competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs. \nThese competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could materially harm our business and operating results.\nIf the delivery of our services to our customers is interrupted or delayed for any reason, our business would suffer.\nAny interruption or delay in the delivery of our services will negatively impact our customers. Our solutions enable secure connections to cloud-based applications and other destinations via the internet, by directing our customers’ internet traffic through our cloud platform. Our customers depend on the continuous availability of our cloud platform to access the internet, and our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, our platform is complex and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after deployment. If we fail to timely detect defects or errors before deployment, or if our entire platform were to fail, customers and users could lose access to critical services and applications until the disruption is resolved or customers deploy our disaster recovery solution that allows them to bypass our cloud platform to access the internet. The adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers expect continuous and uninterrupted internet access and have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration. While we do not consider them to have been material, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors.\nThe following factors, many of which are beyond our control, can affect the delivery and availability of our services and the performance of our cloud:\n•the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet; \n•the performance and availability of third-party telecommunications services with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet access and services; \n•decisions by the owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed or by global telecommunications service provider partners who provide us with network bandwidth to terminate our contracts, \ndiscontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy or prioritize the traffic of other parties; \n•the occurrence of earthquakes, floods, fires, pandemics, power loss, system failures, physical or electronic break-ins, acts of war, international conflicts (such as the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East) or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled or negligent, current or former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events; \n•cyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, our global telecommunications service provider partners or the infrastructure of the internet; \n•government action to limit access to the internet;\n•failure by us to maintain and update our cloud infrastructure to meet our traffic capacity requirements; \n•errors, defects or performance problems in our software, including those potentially introduced by our software updates and third-party software incorporated in our software, which we use to operate our cloud platform; \n•improper classification of websites by our vendors who provide us with lists of malicious websites; \n•improper deployment or configuration of our services by our customers; \n•the failure of our redundancy systems, in the event of a service disruption at one of our data centers, to provide failover to other data centers in our data center network; \n•the failure of our disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements; and\n•the potential implementation of export controls, tariffs or retaliatory measures on the sales of our products in countries where our customers or potential customers are located.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified, could damage our reputation, negatively impact our relationship with our customers or otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we provide our services through a cloud-based inline proxy, and some governments, third-party products, websites or services may block proxy-based traffic under certain circumstances. For example, vendors may attempt to block traffic from our cloud platform or blacklist our IP addresses because they cannot identify the source of the proxy-based traffic. Our competitors may use this as an excuse to block traffic from their solutions or blacklist our IP addresses, which may result in our customers’ traffic being blocked from our platform. If our customers experience significant instances of traffic blockages, they will experience reduced functionality or other inefficiencies, which would reduce customer satisfaction with our services and likelihood of renewal.\nIf we fail to develop or introduce new enhancements to our cloud platform on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers, remain competitive and grow our business could be impaired.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and services, evolving industry standards and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis and continue to introduce enhancements to our cloud platform. For example, advancements in technology, such as AI and ML, are changing the way our industry identifies and responds to cyber threats, and businesses that are slow to adopt or fail to adopt these new \ntechnologies may face a competitive disadvantage. The success of our cloud platform depends on our continued investment in our research and development organization to increase the reliability, availability and scalability of our existing solutions. The success of any enhancement depends on several factors, and any new service that we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If new technologies, including AI-enabled technologies, emerge that deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, these technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively. Any delay or failure in the introduction of enhancements could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our global network of data centers, which deliver our services, was damaged or otherwise failed to meet the requirements of our business, our ability to provide services to our customers and maintain the performance of our cloud platform could be negatively impacted, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe currently host our cloud platform and serve our customers from a global network of over 160 public exchanges globally and thousands of private exchanges at the edge. While we have electronic access to the components and infrastructure of our cloud platform that are hosted by third parties, we do not control the operation of these facilities. Consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as a lack of adequate support for our data center operations due to reasons that are outside of our control. Our data centers are vulnerable to damage and connections to our data centers may be interrupted by a variety of sources, including earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, system or infrastructure failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, human error or interference (including by disgruntled or negligent, current or former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events. Our data centers may also be subject to national or local administrative actions, changes in government regulations, including, for example, the impact of global economic and other sanctions like those levied in response to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operations. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in interruptions or delays in our services, impede our ability to scale our operations or have other adverse impacts upon our business. In addition, if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements or experience significant strains on our data center capacity, we may experience delays and additional expenses in arranging new data centers, and our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and materially harm our business. \nIf our cloud platform or internal networks, systems or data are or are perceived to have been breached, our solution may be perceived as insecure, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nIt is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate the risk of breaches of our cloud platform or other security incidents affecting our cloud platform or our internal systems, networks or data. In addition, the functionality of our platform may be disrupted, either intentionally or due to negligence, including by disgruntled or negligent, current or former employees or contractors. The security measures we use internally and have integrated into our cloud platform, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to identify or protect against certain attacks. Enterprises are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. The growth in state sponsored cyber activity, including those actions taken in connection with the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, showcase the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an electronic intrusion into our customers through our cloud platform or to prevent breaches and other security incidents affecting our cloud platform, internal networks, systems or data. Further, once identified, we may be unable to remediate or otherwise respond to a breach or other incident in a timely manner. Actual, \nperceived or purported security breaches of our cloud platform could result in actual, perceived or purported breaches of our customers’ networks and systems.\nOur internal systems are exposed to the same cybersecurity risks and consequences of a breach as our customers and other enterprises. However, since our business is focused on providing reliable security services to our customers, we believe that an actual, perceived or purported breach of, or security incident affecting, our internal networks, systems or data, could be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our solution and our business. Additionally, many of our personnel work remotely on a hybrid or permanent basis, which may pose additional data security risks.\nFurther, our vendors and service providers have been, and may in the future be, the targets of cyberattacks, and their systems and networks have been, and may in the future be, breached or may contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to their or our systems and networks. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ and service providers’ data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent their security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of our data, including confidential, sensitive, and other information about individuals. Geo-political factors including international conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, may increase the risk of such cyberattacks.\nAny actual, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents that we suffer with regard to our platform, systems, networks or data, including any such actual, perceived or purported security breaches or security incidents that result, or are believed to result, in actual, perceived or purported breaches of our customers’ networks or systems, could result in:\n•the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual, perceived or purported security breach or other security incident;\n•negative publicity and damage to our reputation, brand, and market position;\n•harm to our relationships with, and a loss of, existing or potential customers or channel partners; \n•delayed or lost sales and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;\n•a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance; and\n•legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages and compensation to customers, customers of customers and business partners), litigation (including stockholder claims), regulatory inquiries or investigations and other liability.\nAny of the above could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we maintain insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred in relation to actual, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nIf our cloud platform does not interoperate with our customers’ network and security infrastructure or with third-party products, websites or services, our cloud platform may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur cloud platform must interoperate with our customers’ existing network and security infrastructure. These complex systems are developed, delivered and maintained by the customer and a myriad of vendors and service providers. As a result, the components of our customers’ infrastructure have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, include multiple versions and generations of products and may be highly customized. We must be able to interoperate and provide our security services to customers with highly complex and customized networks, which requires careful planning and execution between our customers, our customer support teams and our channel partners. Further, when new or updated elements of our customers’ infrastructure or new industry standards or protocols are introduced, we may have to update or enhance our cloud platform to allow us to continue to provide services to customers. Our competitors or other vendors may refuse to work with us to allow their products to interoperate with our solutions, which could make it difficult for our cloud platform to function properly in customer networks that include these third-party products.\nWe may not deliver or maintain interoperability quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. These efforts require capital investment and engineering resources. If we fail to maintain compatibility of our cloud platform with our customers’ network and security infrastructures, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our solutions, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and experience reduced demand for our services, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Sales and Operations\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a provider of high-quality security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and channel partners and our ability to attract new customers and channel partners. The successful promotion of our brand will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality features and solutions for our cloud platform, uninterrupted delivery of our cloud services and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry or financial analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our channel partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our channel partners’ services. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, we expand into new markets and more sales are generated through our channel partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected.\nTo increase the number of customers and increase the market acceptance of our platform, we will need to expand our sales and marketing operations, including our domestic and international sales force. Although we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective customers. Therefore, we continue \nto be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our cloud platform will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to expand and further invest in our sales and marketing operations and activities. There is significant competition for sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. We believe that selling a cloud-based security solution requires particularly talented sales personnel with the ability to communicate the transformative potential of our cloud platform. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining enough talented sales personnel in both the U.S. and international markets. \nNew hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. As a result, our new hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain enough qualified individuals in the future. As a result of our rapid growth, a large percentage of our sales and marketing team is new to our company and selling our solutions, and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned employees. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries, or expanding our existing presence, requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. The effectiveness of our sales and marketing has also varied over time and, together with the effectiveness of any partners or resellers we may engage, may vary in the future. Our business and operating results may be harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.\nThe timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our cloud platform, particularly with respect to large organizations. Our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and the value proposition of our cloud platform. Customers often view the subscription to our cloud platform as a significant decision as part of a strategic transformation initiative and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. Large enterprises and government entities in particular often undertake a significant evaluation process that further lengthens the sales cycle. In addition, the impact of macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition by reducing sales, lengthening sales cycles and lowering prices for our services. We have experienced and may experience in the future increased scrutiny and a longer approval process for initial purchases by new customers, as a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nOur sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, and together with our channel account teams, works with our channel partners on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. Platform purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue from a sale will be recognized.\nSales to larger customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller customers, which can act as a disincentive to our sales team to pursue these larger customers. These risks include:\n•competition from companies that traditionally target larger enterprises and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers;\n•increased purchasing power and leverage held by larger customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n•more stringent requirements in our support obligations; and\n•longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to purchase our solutions. \nThe failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions, which are typically one to three years. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods. Consequently, any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period. Any change, however, may affect our revenue in future periods. Additionally, subscriptions that are invoiced annually in advance or multi-year in advance contribute significantly to our short-term and long-term deferred revenue. Accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service and our business could suffer.\nOur customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our cloud platform. Any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could impact the performance of our platform and the availability of services to customers. If we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds. In addition, the limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the United States or other countries. To date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheet for such commitments. Our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer performance issues or downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers.\nOur ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support, including the quality of the support provided on our behalf by certain channel partners. Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not provide superior support to our customers, our ability to renew subscriptions, increase the number of users and sell additional services to customers may be adversely affected. We believe that successfully delivering our cloud solution requires a highly skilled level of customer support and engagement. We or our channel partners must assist our customers to deploy our cloud platform, resolve performance issues, address interoperability challenges with a customer’s existing network and security infrastructure and respond to security threats and cyberattacks. Many enterprises, particularly large organizations, have very complex networks and require high levels of focused support, including premium support offerings, to fully realize the benefits of our cloud platform. Any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and hurt our customer retention, particularly with respect to our large enterprise customers. \nAdditionally, if our channel partners do not provide support to the satisfaction of our customers, we may be required to provide this level of support to those customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources, including the possible use of AI support agents. We may not be able to hire or deploy such resources fast enough to keep up with demand, particularly if the sales of our platform exceed our internal forecasts. We may also not be successful in our efforts to fully onboard new hires and provide adequate training to our employees, many of whom continue to work remotely. To the extent that we or our channel partners are unsuccessful in hiring, training, retaining or deploying adequate support resources, our ability and the ability of our channel partners to provide adequate and timely support to our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction with our cloud platform could be adversely affected. We currently rely in part on contractors provided by third-party service providers internationally to provide support services to our customers, and we expect to expand our international customer service support team to other countries. Any failure to properly train or oversee such contractors could result in a poor customer experience and an adverse impact on our reputation and ability to renew subscriptions or engage new customers. Furthermore, as we sell our solutions internationally, our support organization faces additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could materially harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing and prospective customers and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Jay Chaudhry, our Chief Executive Officer and chairman of our board of directors, who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our business. We have added several new senior management employees in recent years, including our Chief Financial Officer. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves risk, especially nearly simultaneous changes involving so many leaders and employees, and any failure to transition effectively or to retain these new leaders could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, and in other locations where we operate, is often intense, especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications, security software and AI and ML solutions. In addition, the United States and other regions in which we operate have in the past and may again in the future experience acute workforce shortages for highly skilled workers, which in turn, can create hyper-competitive wage environments that may impact our ability to attract and retain employees. We have from time to time experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. For example, in recent years, recruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the ongoing cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. \nIf we fail to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs, or if we need to materially increase the value of the compensation packages necessary to attract and retain these employees, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. \nOur business depends, in part, on sales to the public sector and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of public sector organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with government organizations, and we believe the success and growth of our business will in part depend on adding public sector customers and expanding sales to existing government customers. However, demand from government organizations is often unpredictable, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue from the public sector. Sales to government entities are subject to substantial risks, including the following:\n•selling to government agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often involving significantly longer procurement cycles than commercial sales, and significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;\n•U.S. or other government requirements relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with the public sector affect how we and our channel partners do business with governmental agencies;\n•U.S. or other government certification requirements applicable to our cloud platform, including the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), are often difficult and costly to obtain and maintain and failure to do so will restrict our ability to sell to government customers;\n•government demand and payment for our services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and annual funding authorizations (including the impacts of possible government shutdowns and changes in governmental administrations) and government sales are inherently at risk of securing funding; \n•sales to the U.S. and other governments are subject to procurement regulations, which impose heightened compliance obligations on us and our channel partners;\n•governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and compliance with procurement regulations and any unfavorable investigation or audit could result in fines, civil or criminal liability, further investigations, damage to our reputation and debarment from further government business; \n•government customers procuring commercial items get the benefit of more favorable terms and conditions by operation of law, regardless of agreed upon contractual terms; and \n•changes in government policy positions, including tariffs and other trade regulations, or the threat of such changes; spending priorities or reductions in government employees or programs, which result in a reduction of government spending in general or on technology and cybersecurity products in particular.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future and could result in temporary suspension or permanent debarment from sales to government organizations. Any such penalties, disruptions or limitations in our or our channel partners' ability to do business with the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur international operations expose us to significant risks, and failure to manage those risks could materially and adversely impact our business.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from outside the United States. We derived approximately 49%, 50% and 50% of our revenue from our international customers in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. As of July 31, 2025, approximately 63% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets and our growth strategy includes continued expansion into target geographies, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. These international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks, including:\n•political, economic and social uncertainty or international conflict, such as the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East;\n•unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection, and longer collection periods;\n•reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n•greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices or enforcement policies, trade regulations including tariffs and tax laws and treaties;\n•greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, partners, distributors and resellers to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, anti-bribery laws, export and import control laws, trade and economic sanctions and applicable trade laws and regulations;\n•requirements to comply with foreign privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and information security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance;\n•increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n•difficulties in complying with regulations relating to AI and ML;\n•greater difficulty in identifying, attracting and retaining local qualified personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;\n•differing employment practices and labor relations issues;\n•difficulties in managing and staffing international offices and increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n•fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business, including the British Pound, Indian Rupee and Euro, and related impact on sales cycles; and\n•the impact of natural disasters and public health pandemics and epidemics on customers, partners, suppliers, employees, travel and the global economy.\nAs we continue to develop and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional \ninternational markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks could limit the future growth of our business.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur business strategy includes acquiring other complementary solutions, technologies or businesses. We have in the past acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. In order to expand our security offerings and features, we also may enter into relationships with other businesses, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we cannot assure you that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\nThese kinds of acquisitions or investments may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and services, personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired business choose not to work for us. We may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or using or continuing the development of the acquired technologies. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may:\n•issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n•use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n•incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n•incur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n•encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures;\n•experience delays in extending our internal control over financial reporting to new acquisitions or investments; \n•experience delays in our quarterly close process and related filings with the SEC; and\n•become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. \nThese challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage certain risks and challenges related to our India operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our significant presence in India provides important advantages for our business, such as direct access to a large pool of skilled professionals. However, it also creates certain risks that we must effectively manage. As of July 31, 2025, 37% of our global work force is based in India and is comprised mostly of R&D, finance and operations professionals. \nWage costs in India for skilled professionals are currently lower than in the United States for comparably skilled professionals. However, wages and benefit costs in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals. There is intense competition in India for skilled technical professionals, and we expect such competition to increase. As a result, we may be unable to retain our current employee base in India or hire additional new talent or do so cost-effectively. In addition, India has experienced natural disasters, civil unrest and terrorism and, in the past, has been and may again be involved in conflicts with neighboring countries, such as the recent conflict with Pakistan. If we are unable to effectively manage any of the foregoing risks related to our India operations, our development efforts and operations could be impaired, which could materially and negatively impact our growth and operating results.\nOur failure to raise additional capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new solutions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and Notes repayment requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, need to raise additional funds to fund our operating expenses, make capital purchases, acquire or invest in business or technology, and we may not be able to obtain those funds on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of our debt would have priority over the holders of our common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock, though we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We may also be required to take other actions, any of which could harm our business and operating results. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \nRisks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, Data Security and Privacy\nThe actual or perceived failure of our cloud platform to block malware or prevent a security breach or incident could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur cloud platform may fail to detect or prevent security breaches or incidents for any number of reasons. Our cloud platform is complex and may contain performance issues that are not detected until after its deployment. We also provide frequent solution updates and fundamental enhancements, which increase the possibility of errors, and our reporting, tracking, monitoring and quality assurance procedures may not be sufficient to ensure we detect any such defects in a timely manner. The performance of our cloud platform can be negatively impacted by our failure to enhance, expand or update our cloud platform, bugs, errors or defects in our software, improper classification of websites by our vendors who provide us with lists of malicious websites, improper deployment or configuration of our services and many other factors.\nIn addition, the techniques used by cyber threat actors, including state sponsored actors, to access or sabotage networks and other systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, there is a risk that a cyber threat could emerge that our services are unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are impacted. The growth in state sponsored cyber activity showcases the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and dramatically expands the global threat landscape. Moreover, as our services are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind cyber threats will focus on finding ways to defeat our services or to target our systems. If this happens, our cloud platform could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and create the perception that our cloud platform is not capable of providing superior security, which, in \nturn, could have a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions. Further, high profile security breaches or incidents, in particular those of cloud-based service providers, may cause our customers and potential customers to lose trust in cloud solutions generally, and with respect to security in particular, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers.\nIncreasingly, enterprises are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems, including traditional threat actors, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), social engineering attacks (such as deep fakes), targeted phishing attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, advanced attacks conducted or sponsored by nation-states, advanced persistent threat intrusions, ransomware and other malware, attacks on their vendors and supply chains, and theft or misuse of intellectual property or business or personal data, including by disgruntled or negligent, current or former employees or contractors. No security solution, including our cloud platform, can address all possible security threats, which are becoming increasingly frequent and sophisticated with the development of AI and ML, or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security breach or incident. Our customers typically rely on complex network and security infrastructures, which include products and services from multiple vendors, to secure their networks. If any of our customers becomes infected with malware or experiences a security breach or incident, they could be disappointed with our services, regardless of whether our services are intended to block the attack or would have blocked the attack if the customer had properly configured our cloud platform. Additionally, if any enterprises that are publicly known to use our services are the subject of a cyberattack that becomes publicized, our current or potential customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our services.\nFrom time to time, industry or financial analysts and research firms test our solutions against other security products. Our services may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons, including misconfiguration. To the extent potential customers, industry or financial analysts or testing firms believe that the occurrence of a failure to detect or prevent any particular threat is a flaw or indicates that our services do not provide significant value, our reputation and business could be materially harmed.\nAny real or perceived flaws in our cloud platform or any real, perceived or purported security breaches or other security incidents of our customers could result in:\n•a loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners; \n•delayed or lost sales and harm to our financial condition and results of operations; \n•a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance; \n•the expenditure of significant financial resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, remediate or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities and to address any applicable legal or contractual obligations relating to any actual, perceived or purported security breach or incident; \n•negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand; and \n•legal claims and demands (including for stolen assets or information, repair of system damages, and compensation to customers and business partners), litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations and other liability. \nAny of the above results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, with data security being a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make public statements in our policies, on our website, and elsewhere describing the security of our platform and the performance of our solutions. As a result, we may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices alleging these statements are not accurate, brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state, local or foreign regulators and private litigants.\nIssues in the development, use and execution of AI and ML, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may harm our business.\nWe are increasingly utilizing AI and ML capabilities, including, for example, those relating to generative AI and large language models, into our product offerings. The rapid evolution of AI and ML requires the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI and ML are implemented responsibly to benefit our business, while also minimizing any unintended or harmful impact. As with many developing technologies, AI and ML present risks and challenges, many of which may be unknown, that could affect their further development, adoption and use. These risks and challenges could undermine public confidence in AI and ML, which could slow or even halt its adoption and negatively affect our business. Further, a quickly evolving legal and regulatory environment may cause us to incur increased research and development costs, or divert resources from other development efforts, to address social and ethical issues related to AI and ML. In addition, as the regulatory landscape for AI and ML evolves, we must develop and maintain robust internal policies and standards that clarify functional roles and responsibilities for the responsible and compliant development and deployment of AI technologies. The use of AI technologies presents emerging ethical issues that could become controversial and failure, or perceived failure, to establish or enforce such policies and clear lines of accountability could increase our risk of noncompliance, operational errors or reputational harm. As a result of these and other challenges associated with our use, implementation and training of AI and ML, or misunderstandings or misrepresentations by third parties about the type of data that we use to train AI or ML, we may in the future be subject to legal liability, competitive harm, negative media coverage or regulatory action, including new proposed, and in certain cases enacted, rules and legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union, new applications of existing data protection, privacy, cybersecurity, information security, intellectual property and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. \nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our cloud platform, and our inability to obtain or maintain rights to the technology could harm our business.\nWe license software and other technology from third parties that we incorporate into or integrate with, our cloud platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our services or that our licensors' technology does not include flaws that could harm the performance of our cloud platform or malicious code that could expose our platform to cyberthreats. In addition, many licenses are non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them, or otherwise provide for a limited term. If we are unable to continue to license any of this technology for any reason, our ability to develop and sell our services containing such technology could be harmed. Similarly, if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties now or in the future, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. This could limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and services and increase our costs of production. As a result, our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed. Additionally, as part of our longer-term strategy to grow our business, we may consider opening our cloud platform to third-party developers and applications to further extend its functionality, but we cannot be certain that such efforts to grow our business will be successful.\nSome of our technology incorporates \"open source\" software, and we license some of our software through open source projects, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nOur solutions incorporate software licensed by third parties under open source licenses, including open source software included in software we receive from third-party commercial software vendors. Use of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, updates or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the wide \navailability of open source software used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities. In particular, some of the open source software we incorporate into our products may include LLMs. Using open source LLMs can present uncertainty regarding license terms and restrictions, potential exposure to intellectual property or privacy claims related to training data, increased risk of embedded bias or security vulnerabilities and challenges in compliance with evolving AI-specific regulations. Furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. and other courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or commercialize our solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. In addition, by the terms of some open source licenses, under certain conditions we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, including authorizing further modification and redistribution. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to such requirements by an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our services, each of which provide an advantage to our competitors or other entrants to the market, create security vulnerabilities in our solutions and could reduce or eliminate the value of our services. Further, if we are held to have breached or otherwise failed to comply with the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to release certain of our proprietary source code under open source licenses, pay monetary damages, seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our services on terms that are not economically feasible or be subject to injunctions that could require us to discontinue the sale of our services if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. Moreover, our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform may not be effective. Responding to any infringement or noncompliance claim by an open source vendor, regardless of its validity, or discovering open source software code in our platform could harm our business, operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\n•resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation;\n•diverting management’s time and attention from developing our business;\n•requiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;\n•causing delays in the deployment of our platform or service offerings to our customers;\n•requiring us to stop offering certain services on or features of our platform;\n•requiring us to redesign certain components of our platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology, which could require significant effort and expense;\n•requiring us to disclose our software source code and the detailed program commands for our software; and\n•requiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of our cloud platform and the systems we use to operate our business and provide services to our customers, and any disruption in the availability of these components could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network, replace defective equipment in our existing data centers or otherwise operate our business and provide services to our customers.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for several components of our cloud platform and the systems we use to operate our business and provide services to our customers, including sole or limited sourced hardware, software and SaaS services. Some of our suppliers also temporarily hold a portion of our assets for us. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us \nto risks, including reduced control over production costs, constraints based on the then-current availability, terms and pricing of these components and potential loss of assets. For example, we generally purchase equipment or the components of equipment on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply. We also rely on sole or limited sourced SaaS vendors to provide critical services that we use to operate our business. In addition, the technology industry has experienced component shortages, delivery delays, price increases and service interruptions in the past, and we may experience shortages, delays, materially increased costs or service interruptions in the future, including as a result of natural disasters, acts of war or international conflicts, epidemics or global pandemics, increased demand in the industry or if our suppliers do not have sufficient rights to supply the components in all jurisdictions in which we may host our services. While global economic conditions have not yet had a material impact on our supply chain, these conditions have increased our costs in the past and could result in disruptions and delays for components in the future. Additionally, changes to existing international trade agreements, tariffs, export controls or other trade measures and regulations that impact our sourcing partners or us could lead to increased costs to operate our business and to disruptions in our supply chain, which could limit our ability to support our customers. For instance, there is a risk that current geopolitical, diplomatic and other developments affecting the relationship between China and Taiwan may materially and negatively impact the availability of certain critical components that we use in our data centers, which we source from overseas. If our supply of certain components is disrupted or delayed, there can be no assurance that available alternatives can serve as adequate replacements for the existing components or that alternatives will be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, as it may take several months or longer to identify, qualify and engage a new supplier or integrator. Any disruption or delay in access to components may delay opening new data centers, delay increasing capacity or replacing defective equipment at existing data centers, cause other constraints on our operations that could damage our channel partner or customer relationships or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business.\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the networking and security industry frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they previously developed, have purchased or otherwise obtained. Many companies, including our competitors, may now, and in the future, have significantly larger and more mature patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret portfolios than we have, which they may use to assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us. In addition, intellectual property litigation may involve non-practicing entities or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Third parties have asserted in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us and these claims, even without merit, could harm our business, including by increasing our costs, reducing our revenue, creating customer concerns that result in delayed or reduced sales, distracting our management from the running of our business and requiring us to cease use of important intellectual property. In addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our services. Moreover, in a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of \ndiscovery required in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by the discovery process.\nAs the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Our insurance may not cover intellectual property rights infringement claims. Third parties have in the past and may in the future also assert infringement claims against our customers or channel partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such employees have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other U.S. federal courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Appeals Board, and their foreign counterparts, have made and may continue to make changes to the interpretation of patent laws in their respective jurisdictions. We cannot predict future changes to the interpretation of existing patent laws or whether U.S. or foreign legislative bodies will amend such laws in the future. Any changes may lead to uncertainties or increased costs and risks surrounding the outcome of third-party infringement claims brought against us and the actual or enhanced damages, including treble damages, that may be awarded in connection with any such current or future claims and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n We are unable to predict the likelihood of success in defending against future infringement claims. In the event that we fail to successfully defend ourselves against an infringement claim, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or otherwise require payment of legal fees, settlement payments, ongoing royalties or other costs or damages; or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from offering certain services or features; or we may be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, to use the relevant technology. If we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected services or features, effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we were to prevail, third-party infringement lawsuits could be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, deter channel partners from selling or licensing our services and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our services, which would also materially harm our business. In addition, any public announcements of the results of any proceedings in third-party infringement lawsuits could be negatively perceived by industry or financial analysts and investors and could cause our stock price to experience volatility or decline. Further, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe believe our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business, and our success and ability to compete depend in part upon protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and our patents, trademarks and copyrights may be held invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents in the United States and in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents \nagainst certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Moreover, we may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Additionally, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and to maintain issued patents. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, it could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, and even if we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, our intellectual property may be stolen, including by cybercrimes, and we may not be able to identify the perpetrators or prevent the exploitation of our intellectual property by our competitors or others. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, technology and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult, particularly outside of the United States. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s attention, either of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. The inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, we cannot assure you that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate any of our technology, or design around our patents.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced IT security spending may adversely impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur operations and performance depend in part on worldwide economic conditions and the impact these conditions have on levels of spending on IT networking and security solutions. Our business depends on the overall demand for these solutions and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to purchase our security services. A broad reduction in IT security spending would have a material impact to our business.\nThe United States and the global economy have recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. The existence of inflation in the U.S. and global economy, the pricing pressure created by rising inflation in prior periods and changes to trade regulations including tariffs may result in high interest rates and capital costs, high shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. Elevated inflation rates can affect our expenses, especially employee compensation. In addition, rising interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cash on hand and increase our borrowing costs. Inflation and related increases in interest rates could also increase our customers' operating costs, which could result in reduced IT budgets, less demand for our solutions, or delays in new orders, renewals or payments due to us.\nGovernments have and are implementing fiscal policy interventions in response to high levels of inflation, including raising interest rates or keeping them at elevated levels. Even if these interventions lower inflation to desirable levels, they may also reduce economic growth rates, create recessions and increase unemployment rates. This could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, if our customers were to reduce their IT budgets or workforces in response to deteriorating economic conditions, they may not purchase or renew subscriptions for our services or may renew for fewer users or less expensive services. These policy changes have provided a benefit to us as a \nresult of the increased interest income we earn on our cash and investments, but a reduction of interest rates in the future would reduce this income.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the ongoing effects of inflation, high interest rates, regional or global recessions and changing trade regulations including tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways, including by reducing sales, lengthening sales cycles and requiring us to lower prices for our services.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Regulatory, Accounting and Tax Matters\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and cybersecurity, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In addition, emerging tools and technologies we utilize in providing our products, like AI and ML, are subject to regulation under new laws as well as new applications of existing laws. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. These laws and regulations impose added costs on our business. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to:\n•investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions;\n•mandatory changes to our cloud platform;\n•disgorgement of profits, fines and damages;\n•civil and criminal penalties or injunctions;\n•claims for damages by our customers or channel partners;\n•termination of contracts; and \n•loss of intellectual property rights.\nIf any government sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a global employer, we are subject to various labor laws, including worker classification laws, that impact compliance obligations regarding working time, proper payment for time worked, time off regulations, as well as anti-retaliation, discrimination and harassment policies and compliance with employee representative rights. We take reasonable efforts to comply with applicable labor laws and regulations impacting our workforce, but failure to comply with such laws could result in government enforcement actions and penalties, may negatively impact business operations and may be harmful to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nThese laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners or customers, penalties, termination of contracts and loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property. \nIf we were not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements or regulations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security matters are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Our handling of personal data is subject to various data protection, cybersecurity, information security and other telecommunications regulations or requirements where we offer our solutions around the world. We also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other cybersecurity or information security or data protection-related organizations that require us to comply with rules pertaining to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and information security. Further, we may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations and other actual and asserted obligations, such as industry standards, relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could also impact our business.\nThe U.S. federal government, and various state and foreign governments, have adopted or proposed laws and regulations on the collection, distribution, use, storage, transfer and other processing of information relating to individuals. Such laws and regulations may, among other things, require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit customers to access, correct and delete information stored or maintained by companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their information and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ consent to use information for certain purposes. Numerous U.S. states have enacted, and others are expected to enact, privacy laws, and a federal privacy law is being considered. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the U.S. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling, storage, disclosure, transfer and other processing of information relating to individuals and fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Furthermore, cross-border data transfers face increasing restrictions and compliance requirements. Following the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield and ongoing challenges to Standard Contractual Clauses, data localization requirements and transfer restrictions continue to evolve. Various countries have implemented or are considering data residency requirements that could limit our ability to provide global services efficiently or require significant infrastructure investments. In addition, the number of emerging and existing data protection, privacy and security laws and regulations creates the risk that obligations may be interpreted inconsistently between jurisdictions, which may make it difficult for us to comply with our privacy, data protection and security obligations globally. \nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, information security and telecommunications services in the jurisdictions in which we operate or may operate, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Needing to address new obligations and changes in the interpretation of existing obligations could require us to modify our solutions, restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. New and evolving requirements may increase compliance costs, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability, may require additional contractual negotiations, and may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards or actual or asserted obligations, or any actual, perceived or purported security breach or other security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of information relating to individuals or other data, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions and other proceedings, private claims and litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and prospective customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to governmental import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions and other trade controls including tariffs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce's Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries and governments of these countries, as well as other persons and entities. For example, the U.S. and other countries have implemented economic and other sanctions, as well as increased export controls in response to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. These measures have continued to increase. These export controls and sanctions and any additional restrictions may impact our ability to operate in Russia and other affected regions. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide our services and software and operate our cloud platform or could limit our customers’ ability to access or use our services or software in those countries.\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our services and software from being provided in violation of such laws, our services and software may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines. We may also be materially and adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. \nIn addition, changes in our platform; export, sanctions and import laws and regulations or tariffs and other trade regulations could delay the introduction of our products and reduce the sale of subscriptions to our platform in international markets, prevent users in certain countries from accessing our services or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our services to certain countries, governments, persons or entities altogether. Any change or threatened change in export or import regulations, tariffs, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could decrease our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform or provide software to existing customers or potential new customers with international operations. Any decrease in our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform or provide software could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe vast majority of our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, a portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies, which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A weakening U.S. dollar could increase the cost of these foreign currency-denominated expenses in dollar terms. We are also exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies.\nWe have a foreign currency risk management program, in which we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which we designate as cash flow hedges. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The use of \nthese hedging activities may not be successful in effectively mitigating the potentially adverse impact on our financial statements due to unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates. \nIf we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Further, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates may result in poorer overall financial performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, capped call contracts and non-collateralized interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements may default, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. In times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the impaired liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such a default, we could incur significant losses, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe are expanding our international operations and staff to support our business in international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate the business flows and future growth into the international markets, and consider the functions, risks and assets of the various entities involved in the intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. For example, certain jurisdictions have recently introduced a digital services tax, which is generally a tax on gross revenue generated from users or customers located in those jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering enacting similar laws. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to the intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, or if there are changes in tax laws or the way existing tax laws are interpreted or applied, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.\nMany countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). Many countries have enacted or begun the process of enacting laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of July 31, 2025, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of approximately $1,057.0 million and $504.7 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. Beginning in 2025, $426.8 million of state net operating losses began to expire at different periods. The remaining $77.9 million of state net operating losses will carry forward indefinitely. As of July 31, 2025, we had foreign net operating loss carryforward of $87.7 million, all of which will be carried forward indefinitely. \nAs of July 31, 2025, we also had U.S. federal, California, and foreign research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of $192.8 million, $102.6 million, and $2.1 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring at different periods beginning in 2037. Our California research and development tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely. Foreign tax credits will begin to expire in the fiscal year ending 2033. Realization of these net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that a portion of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership by \"5% shareholders\" over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. As a result, in the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we experience one or more ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal taxable liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. Furthermore, our state carryforwards may be subject to similar and additional limitations. \nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales because we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our services in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of July 31, 2025, our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 41.4% of our common stock outstanding with Jay Chaudhry, our Chief Executive Officer and chairman of our board of directors, and his affiliates beneficially owning approximately 17.0% of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have significant control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be \ntaken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n•a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n•the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n•the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer or president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n•the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to affect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n•the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. \nThese provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n•actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;\n•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n•industry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n•volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock from time to time;\n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n•the sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n•issuances of shares of our common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes;\n•failure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n•litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights or our solutions, or third-party proprietary rights;\n•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n•actual or perceived privacy, data protection, or security incidents or breaches;\n•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and our responses thereto;\n•any major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to Mr. Chaudhry;\n•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, global pandemics or responses to these events. \nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, as well as any issuances of our common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2028 Notes or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. We may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and dilute your voting power. For instance, prior to April 15, 2028, our 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, or the 2028 Notes, are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions or upon the occurrence of certain events. After April 15, 2028, holders may convert all or any portion of the 2028 Notes at their option at any time. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2028 Notes and we elect to settle all or any portion of such conversions in shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, certain holders of the 2028 Notes may engage in short selling to hedge their position in the 2028 Notes. Any anticipated future issuances of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Notes could also depress the price of our common stock. \nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nIf industry or financial analysts issue inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, the stock prices of many companies in the technology industry have declined significantly after \nthose companies have failed to meet, or significantly exceed, the financial guidance publicly announced by the companies or the expectations of analysts. If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our common stock or publish unfavorable research about us. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our visibility in the financial markets could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n•any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n•any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n•any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nEach of these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nRisks Related to the 2028 Notes\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, which may impact our cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. \nOn July 3, 2025, we issued $1,725 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, which mature on July 15, 2028. Prior to April 15, 2028, the 2028 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions or upon the occurrence of certain events. During the quarter ended July 31, 2025, the conditions allowing holders of the 2028 Notes to convert were not met. After April 15, 2028, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2028 Notes at their option at any time. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2028 Notes when eligible, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2028 Notes being converted. \nAdditionally, holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase the 2028 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the \nfundamental change repurchase date for such 2028 Notes. If the 2028 Notes have not previously been converted or repurchased, we will be required to repay the 2028 Notes in cash at maturity. \nOur ability to make such payments or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2028 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments. We plan to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, market conditions, our liquidity profile and various financing alternatives (including the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities) for opportunities to enhance our capital structure.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2028 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions, or the Option Counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2028 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. \nThe Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2028 Notes (and are likely to do so during the observation period related to a conversion of the 2028 Notes, in connection with any fundamental change repurchase of the 2028 Notes and, to the extent we unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions, following any other repurchase of the 2028 Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2028 Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe Option Counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Option Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such Option Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an Option Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the Option Counterparties.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, acts of war, international conflicts, terrorism and security breaches or incidents.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or public health emergency, occurring at our headquarters, in India, where we have significant facilities, or where a key channel partner, vendor or data center is located could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect our \ncomponent suppliers or other third-party providers, including our network bandwidth and SaaS solution providers, this could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide services in a timely or cost-effective manner. \nIn addition, natural disasters, acts of war, international conflicts, such as the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, terrorism and other geopolitical unrest or health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic disease, or fear of such events, could cause disruptions in our or our customers’ businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. In addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may become more frequent and effective through the use of AI. As a result, our internal systems may be victimized by such attacks. Although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, security breaches and incidents and loss of critical data. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our platform to the satisfaction of our users may materially harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws in the United States and other countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. We leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our platform and conduct our business abroad. We and these third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with anti-bribery laws, our employees or agents may violate our policies and applicable law, and we could be ultimately held responsible for these violations. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage and other consequences. Any investigations, actions or sanctions could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq. The requirements of these rules and regulations will impose significant legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We have developed our disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other procedures to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is \nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.\nOur current controls and any new controls we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended and anticipate we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and provide significant management oversight. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. If our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements include those related to determination of revenue recognition, deferred revenue, deferred contract acquisition costs, capitalized internal-use software, valuation of acquired intangible assets, period of benefit generated from our deferred contract acquisition costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of common stock options and stock-based awards, \nuseful lives of property and equipment, useful lives of acquired intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, loss contingencies related to litigation, fair value of the 2028 Notes and the discount rate used for operating leases. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. Such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe rely on third parties for certain essential financial and operational services, and a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe rely on third parties to provide many essential financial and operational services to support our business. Many of these vendors are less established and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. Moreover, these vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. As a result, we depend upon these vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes. Any failure by these vendors to do so, or any disruption in our ability to access the internet, would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our operations.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially and adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become, involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",
