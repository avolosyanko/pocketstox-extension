      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS \nOverview \nUpstart is the leading artificial intelligence (“AI”) lending marketplace, connecting millions of consumers to more than 100 banks and credit unions that leverage Upstart’s AI models and cloud applications to deliver superior credit products. Founded in 2012, Upstart’s platform includes unsecured and secured credit products, such as personal loans, automotive retail and refinance loans, and home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). \nWe’re dedicated to improving access to credit for all. Money is a fundamental ingredient of life, and unless you are in the few percent of Americans with significant wealth, the price of borrowing affects you every day. Throughout history, affordable credit has been central to unlocking mobility and opportunity. The FICO score was invented in 1989 and remains the standard for determining who is approved for credit and at what interest rate. While FICO is rarely the only input in a lending decision, most lenders use simple rules-based systems that consider only a limited number of variables. Unfortunately, because these legacy credit systems fail to accurately identify and quantify risk, millions of creditworthy individuals are left out of the system, and millions more pay too much to borrow money.\nUpstart AI remakes the lending process. We leverage AI to more accurately quantify the true risk of a loan. Our AI models have been continuously upgraded, trained and refined for more than ten years. We apply AI models to income and identity fraud, acquisition targeting, loan stacking, time-delimited default and prepayment prediction, and servicing. \nWe believe the flywheel effects generated by our constantly improving AI models provide a significant competitive advantage. More training data generally leads to higher approval rates and lower interest rates with better returns to our bank and credit union partners, collectively our “lending partners.” Our AI also enables our lending partners to deliver an exceptional digital-first experience. They can respond instantly to a customer’s loan request 24/7 with no human intervention. In 2024, more than 91%1 of Upstart-powered loans were fully automated where borrowers were approved instantly. \nOur AI marketplace connects consumers with our lending partners. Consumers can access Upstart-powered loans via Upstart.com, through a lender-branded product on our lending partners’ own websites, and through auto dealerships that use our products. \nLoans issued through our marketplace are retained by our lending partners, purchased by our network of institutional investors, or funded by Upstart’s balance sheet. Investors may also invest in securities collateralized by Upstart-powered loans through our pass-through and securitization programs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, out of the total principal of loan originations facilitated on our marketplace in 2024, 65% were purchased by institutional investors, 25% were retained by our lending partners, and 10% were held on our balance sheet. In the year ended December 31, 2024, our top three lending partners collectively originated 82% of the loans facilitated through our marketplace and revenue from fees received from these lending partners accounted for 63% of our total revenue. Our goal is to continue expanding our lending partnerships to new participants and deepen our relationships with existing lending partners.\n1 Percentage of Loans Fully Automated, which is defined as the total number of loans in a given period originated end-to-end (from initial rate request to final funding for personal loans and small dollar loans, and from initial rate request to signing of the loan agreement for auto loans) with no human involvement required by the Company divided by the Transaction Volume, Number of Loans in the same period.\n7\n\n\nInstitutional investors play an important role in our lending marketplace by providing capital for higher risk loans that may not be economically feasible for traditional banks and credit unions to hold. We enter into nonexclusive agreements with our institutional investors who purchase whole loans and participate in our pass-through and asset-backed securitization programs. Beginning in 2023, to improve the loan funding capacity for our marketplace across business and macroeconomic cycles, we secured multiple committed capital and other co-investment arrangements with institutional investors which have delivered a significant amount of loan funding to the Upstart marketplace. We continue our work on further developing and securing committed capital and other co-investment arrangements for our marketplace. While these efforts have strengthened the amount and resiliency of our loan funding, we continue to secure additional capital to support the growth of our business and further diversify our sources of capital and institutional investor base to ensure long-term scalability.\n\nOur revenue is primarily comprised of fees paid by lending partners and institutional investors. We charge our lending partners platform and referral fees at origination and the agreements with our lending partners may contain minimum fee amounts. We also earn loan servicing revenue from contracts with lending partners and institutional investors. As a usage-based platform, we target positive unit economics on each transaction, leading to a cash efficient business model with high margins. We believe these are the key components to achieve both high growth rates and profitability over time. \nOur AI Lending Models \nOur AI models are central to our value proposition and unique position in the industry. They are central to the efficacy of the Upstart marketplace experience we provide to consumers and the value we deliver to lending partners and institutional investors. The key aspects of our AI models include:Variables and Training Data \nThe volume of data utilized by Upstart’s AI models has grown significantly over time. Our personal loan underwriting model included 23 variables at the end of 2014; as of December 31, 2024, it included over 2,500.2 These include variables related to credit experience, employment, educational history, bank account transactions, cost of living and loan application interactions. As of December 31, 2024, our personal loan underwriting model was trained on nearly 82 million repayment events, and it is only one of approximately 30 machine learning models that we use across our business.\nThe number of variables and volume of training data used in our models are co-dependent; the use of hundreds or thousands of variables is impractical without sophisticated machine learning algorithms to tease out the interactions among them, and sophisticated machine learning depends on large volumes of training data. Over time, we have been able to deploy and blend more sophisticated modeling techniques, leading to a more accurate system. This co-dependency presents a challenge to others who may aim to short-circuit the development of competitive models. While incumbent lenders may have vast quantities of historical repayment data, their training data lacks the hundreds of non-traditional variables that power our models. Modeling Techniques\nGrowth in our training data has enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated modeling techniques. For example, while earlier versions of our models were centered on logistic regression and Monte Carlo simulations, our more recent models incorporate neural networks, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and gradient boosting. We expect that our data science investments and continued growth of training data will unlock even more powerful techniques over time.\n2 “Variables,” often also called “features,” refers to raw variables and combined variables considered in our AI models. A “raw” variable is a non-combined, conceptually distinct unit of data, such as “applicant-reported savings.” A “combined” variable is data that has been transformed, combined, or otherwise engineered from a raw variable or set of raw variables, such as “applicant-reported savings” divided by “loan amount.”\nModel Applications\nWhile our first model focused on predicting the likelihood of loan default, we have since applied models throughout the process of credit origination. These models quantify and reduce risk in various ways, while also increasing automation and funnel conversion.\nThe currently active AI models within the Upstart platform—shared by and available to all Upstart’s lending partners—include:\n•Acquisition targeting—identifies consumers likely to qualify for and have need for a loan; \n•Loan stacking—identifies consumers likely to take out multiple loans in a short period of time; \n•Time-delimited prepayment prediction—quantifies the likelihood that a consumer will fully prepay a loan earlier than originally scheduled; \n•Income fraud—quantifies the risk of potential misrepresentation of borrower income; \n•Identity fraud—quantifies the risk that an applicant is misrepresenting their identity; \n•Time-delimited default prediction—quantifies the likelihood of default for each period of the loan term; and \n•Servicing—identifies borrowers to prioritize for servicing outreach, allowing for customized intervention and improved servicing efficiency.\nDespite their sophistication, our AI models are delivered to lending partners in the form of a simple cloud application that shields borrowers from the underlying complexity. Additionally, our platform allows lending partners to tailor lending applications based on their policies and business needs. Within the construct of each lender’s self-defined lending program, our platform enables the origination of conforming and compliant loans at a low per-loan cost.\nOur Ecosystem \nOur ecosystem includes consumers, banks, credit unions and auto dealers, as well as institutional investors who purchase Upstart-powered loans directly or invest in securities issued by our pass-through and securitization programs. This broad ecosystem allows participants to access and benefit from our products in a variety of ways, which leads to broader adoption of our AI lending solutions.Consumers\nOn the consumer side, we have built a mobile app and a mobile-responsive website application to aggregate demand on Upstart.com, where consumers are presented with offers from our lending partners. Consumers can quickly and easily inquire about a rate, evaluate and choose a loan offer, provide necessary information for verification and review required disclosures before final acceptance of the loan. A similar experience is also offered as a branded product on lending partners’ websites. We have also made significant investments in Upstart Auto Retail, a front-end software-as-a-service application that modernizes the auto sales process for both the consumer and the dealer. Similar to Upstart.com, we expect Upstart Auto Retail to become an important aggregator of consumer demand.\nConsumers on our platform are generally offered unsecured personal loans, secured auto loans, and HELOCs. Personal loans typically range from $200 to $50,000 in size, at APRs up to 35.99%, with terms typically ranging from three months to five years. Auto loans range from $3,000 to $60,000 in size, at APRs up to 29.99%, with terms ranging from two to seven years. HELOCs range from $26,000 to $250,000, at APRs up to 18.0%, with terms of 10 or 15 years. All loans feature a monthly repayment schedule and no prepayment penalty.\nValue Proposition to Consumers \n•Higher approval rates and lower interest rates—An internal study, conducted and published in 2024, compared our personal loan AI model to that of a traditional underwriting credit score-based model. The study demonstrated the ability of our AI model to expand credit access to borrowers. Results from the study showed that our AI model approves 101% more borrowers and yields 38% lower average APR for approved loans.\n•Superior digital experience—Whether consumers apply for a loan through Upstart.com or directly through a lending partner’s website, the application experience is streamlined into a single application process and the loan offers provided are firm. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 91% of Upstart-powered loans were fully automated, an increase from 87% in 2023. Automation improvements were due in large part to product, engineering and machine learning enhancements such as eliminating previously manual processes, increasing the accuracy of our verification and fraud detection models, and removing inefficient or unnecessary processes and procedures.\nLending Partners and Institutional Investors\nOn the loan funding side, we target a wide range of small, medium, and large lending partners with an appetite to invest in improved underwriting and digital originations. Because AI is a new and disruptive technology, and lending is a traditionally conservative industry, we have brought our technology to the market in a way that allows us to grow responsibly and improve our AI models, while allowing lenders to take a prudent approach to assessing and adopting our platform. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 100 lending partners. Our lending partners retain loans that align with their business and risk objectives. Because lenders vary with respect to program objectives, risk tolerance and funding capacity, program parameters can vary significantly across different lenders. Lending partners have access to an administrative interface for reporting and program management. We also perform fairness testing on our models to help satisfy lending partners’ regulatory obligations. \nOur lending partners control their programs when originating loans through our platform and do not solely rely on our models alone. Each lending partner sets and approves its own underwriting policy that establishes certain credit underwriting requirements determined by the lending partner. These “hard” requirements or criteria may include, without limitation, minimum credit scores, minimum and maximum loan amounts, and maximum debt to income ratio. Upstart applies the lenders’ hard criteria prior to feeding any information to its underwriting models. The majority of credit denials on the platform are due to the lending partners’ hard criteria from their underwriting policies. Borrower applications that meet a lender’s hard credit criteria are then assessed by a pricing model which takes into account the output of the Upstart risk scoring model in addition to additional pricing requirements set by lenders, such as target return objectives and maximum allowable APR limits. This process allows our lending partners to leverage our technology within the scope of their existing underwriting policies.\nLoan volumes exceeding lending partners’ funding capacity or risk tolerance can be flowed through our marketplace and sold to our network of institutional investors, which have a broader and more diverse appetite for risk. As a result, we can develop our business and our AI models faster than if we relied only on the funding capacity of our lending partners. The combination of lending partner and institutional investor funding provides our lending marketplace with competitive and diverse capital.\nOur network of institutional investors includes investors that buy whole loans originated via Upstart’s platform, as well as investors that buy securities, such as pass-through certificates. We are typically retained by participating institutional investors to service the loans we help originate. In the case of whole loan purchasers, we typically enter into loan purchase agreements and loan servicing agreements with such purchasers. Institutional investors may also purchase interests in loans originated via Upstart’s platform in the form of pass-through certificates. We have pass-through certificate programs sponsored by certain financial institutions under which institutional investors can purchase securities collateralized by Upstart-powered loans from an issuer trust. \nWhile there are minimal differences between whole loan sales and sales of pass-through certificates from Upstart’s perspective, both programs are offered to provide flexibility to institutional investors in our marketplace. Some institutional investors may prefer pass-through certificates, which may be more liquid and require less operational complexity, while other institutional investors may prefer whole loan purchases, which are generally more cost effective. Whole loans purchased after origination may later be included in our asset-backed securitization transactions whereby interests in these Upstart-powered loans are sold to other institutional investors. \nFor our asset-backed securitizations, we engage with investment banks to structure transactions under which we and/or certain of the purchasers of whole loans or pass-through certificates described in the preceding paragraphs sell pools of whole loans to a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity. The special purpose entities, through one or more intermediate transfers and entities, create and sell tranched asset-backed notes and subordinated certificates, in each case, backed by the collective pools of Upstart-powered loans sold into the investment structure. \nValue Proposition to Lending Partners and Institutional Investors \n•Competitive digital lending experience—We provide banks and credit unions with a cost effective way to compete with the technology budgets of their competitors. \n•Expanded customer base—We refer customers that apply for loans through Upstart.com to our lending partners, helping them grow both loan volumes and number of customers. \n•Upstart referral network—Once we aggregate consumer demand on our website, we pass those customers to our lending partners.\n•Flexible configurations—We built a configurable lending solution designed to meet the needs of our lending partners. Because our lending partners have complete authority and control over their lending programs, they predetermine many aspects of their loan offering, including interest rate and loan size ranges, target returns for various risk profiles, minimum credit score, maximum debt-to-income ratio, fee structures and disclosures. \n•Servicing—While most lending partners and institutional investors choose to have us service their loans (through a branded servicing portal), each has the option of directly servicing loans itself. Our servicing platform manages all communication with borrowers, credit reporting agencies, and when necessary, collections agencies.\n•Delivering returns—We focus on credit performance compared to the expectations set by us at the time of origination. An equal investment in all vintages of Upstart-powered core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2024 is currently expected to deliver returns in line with a blended target of 9.6%. At a more granular level, all quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in 2018 through the fourth quarter of 2020 are currently forecasted to meet or exceed the target returns set at the time of loan origination. The quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2024 are currently forecasted to underperform relative to their target returns. The core personal loans that originated in the second quarter of 2024 or later are currently forecasted to deliver returns in line with target yields. This reversion in performance was driven by a combination of factors including increased conservatism in underwriting and the relative stabilization of macroeconomic conditions, as reflected in the Upstart Macro Index (“UMI”).\n•New product offerings—While we continue to iterate and improve on our core Upstart-powered products, we have launched new credit products over the last several years to serve the auto and home lending markets and to provide a small dollar personal loan offering. Personal loans are one of the fastest-growing segments of credit in the U.S. and auto financing is the second largest segment of consumer lending. Our platform helps lenders provide a product their customers want, rather than letting customers seek loans from competitors. We continue to invest in expansion of our product offerings.\n•Access to capital markets—We have built a broad network of institutional investors who provide loan funding through purchases of whole loans, pass-through certificates and asset-backed securitizations. We have secured multiple committed capital and co-investment arrangements with institutional investors, which deliver a significant amount of loan funding to the Upstart marketplace. In these arrangements, we share some of the risk and upside in loan performance relative to our expectations. We continue our work on expanding our relationships with institutional investors to deliver capital to our marketplace. \n•Continuous engagement with rating agencies—Upstart-powered personal loans are analyzed by credit rating agencies and are subject to significant and constant scrutiny from experts. Credit ratings are often publicly available, which help institutional investors and lending partners gain confidence in Upstart-powered loans.\n•Insights into changes in the economy—In 2023, we introduced UMI, which estimates the impact of the macroeconomy on credit performance for Upstart-powered unsecured personal loans and helps our lending partners and institutional investors better understand and account for the effect that macroeconomic conditions have on our credit performance.\nOur Technology Infrastructure\nOur cloud-based software platform incorporates modern technologies and software development approaches to allow for rapid development of new features. \nCloud-Native Technologies \nWe run our technology platform as containerized services on the Amazon Web Services cloud. Our architecture is designed for high availability and horizontal scalability. Our primary development platforms are Ruby on Rails and Python, but our Kubernetes-based compute environment gives us the flexibility to run heterogeneous workloads with minimal operational overhead. We deploy new software regularly without platform downtime, allowing borrowers and lenders to immediately benefit from the latest updates to our platform. \nData Integrity and Security \nOur information security program governs how we safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our consumer and lending partner data. Our environment is continuously monitored with a suite of tools designed to detect and respond to security events in both internal and user-facing systems. We have a robust secure software development cycle and regularly engage with third parties to audit our security program and to perform regular penetration tests of our Web application and cloud environment. \nConfigurable Multi-Tenant Architecture\nOur multi-tenant architecture enables multiple lending partners to use the same version of our application while securely segmenting their data. Though all tenants are using the same version of our platform, our software is designed to be highly configurable to meet the needs of our diverse lending partners, allowing customizations to everything from the applicant user interface to the core rules governing credit decisioning. \nMachine Learning Platform\nIn order to support innovation in our underwriting, fraud detection and acquisition models, we have developed proprietary technologies to enable our machine learning team to develop, train, test and deploy new model updates with minimal engineering support. Our backend systems are designed to flexibly integrate with multiple third-party data sources to feed these models and support real-time decisioning.\nResponsive Web Design\nOur user interface is responsive to ensure applicants and borrowers have a smooth experience regardless of whether they are accessing our website from a desktop, mobile device or tablet. \nRobust Reporting and Integration Capabilities\nOur reporting application programming interfaces (“APIs”) provide institutional investors and lending partners the ability to access data through a programmatic interface. Our integration capabilities with lending partners include an ability to pre-fill applicant information via API and provide loan details in real-time to facilitate a seamless process from application to origination. Our lending partner reporting portal provides our lending partners with a centralized console to view real time performance metrics of their lending program, view and verify their credit policy and program configuration, and on-demand access to operational reports and documents.\nConsumer Marketing \nOur growth and marketing approach is driven by the strength of our product and the interest rates we offer. While many lenders see consumer choice as a detractor from sales volume, we benefit when consumers compare our offers to other lenders’ offers. Over time, in large part due to the rapid and continuing improvements to our models, our ability to offer lower rates than our competitors has improved and we have been able to extend new loan offers to applicants who were previously not eligible or were previously quoted a higher rate. \nOur growth and marketing initiatives are primarily focused on bringing potential borrowers to Upstart.com, where they can learn if they qualify for a loan from one of our lending partners and the terms of the loan offer in only a few minutes. Our customer acquisition channels combine a mix of online and offline, as well as paid and unpaid, channels. While we constantly experiment to expand and optimize our acquisition strategies, our largest channels include: \n•Marketing affiliates—A variety of online media partners, such as loan aggregators, send us traffic on a cost per origination basis. Many loan aggregators also incorporate application data to provide online prescreened offers, which leads to highly targeted and interested referrals. For example, a significant number of consumers that apply for and obtain a loan on Upstart.com learn about and access Upstart.com through the website of one of our partners, Credit Karma. \n•Direct mail—We apply our strengths in data science to target individuals who both qualify for and may have a need for an Upstart-powered loan. The ability to analyze an individual’s credit data to target and mail prescreened offers of credit gives this channel a meaningful data advantage over other channels. \n•Organic traffic—As our brand recognition and reputation grow, an increasing number of potential borrowers come directly to Upstart.com. \n•Email marketing—We have an automated email program that sends customized messages and reminders to potential borrowers once they have created accounts to encourage them to complete their loan application. \n•Online advertising—Search engines and social channels enable targeted outreach to potential borrowers with specific messages. In addition, we also advertise on streaming television services.\nOperations \nWe have developed sophisticated tools that our internal operations team uses to support the origination and servicing of credit. Our operations teams, including credit analysts, fraud specialists, customer support, payments specialists, and supporting services (like quality assurance and training) work to deliver a seamless user experience to consumers on behalf of our lending partners.\nLoan Origination Operations\nWhile verification is primarily and increasingly handled by our software and AI models, we also offer Upstart-designed tools to guide credit analysts and fraud specialists in cases where our software is not yet able to sufficiently verify borrower information. By providing a prescriptive and unique path for each applicant, our system helps our operations team provide a streamlined experience for as many borrowers as possible.\nThis team focuses on the minority of borrowers whose applications are not entirely automated or any applicant who has questions or issues throughout the application process, while expediting the approval process to the extent possible, and identifying and rejecting fraudulent applications. Our operations team works closely with our engineering and machine learning teams to further increase our levels of automation. \nMost prospective borrowers and applicants interact with Upstart via our online platform and help center, but we also make agent-based support readily available to all borrowers. For phone support, we partner with external call center vendors and have a team of dedicated Upstart agents with specialized training. \nServicing Operations \nUpstart-powered loans, with the exception of HELOCs, are serviced via our homegrown platform. For borrowers who miss payments, we focus on early intervention and attempt to reach them via emails, calls, texts, and mail to help bring their account current or offer hardship options in accordance with the creditor’s servicing policies. Borrowers on our platform are supported via a combination of internal payments specialists and third-party service providers. \nWe hold collections licenses in the majority of states and conduct first-party collections activities. We also partner with third-party agencies for collections, especially for accounts more than 30 days past due. Debt collection calls and collection performance are reviewed regularly by our quality assurance or vendor management teams. Our operations and compliance teams each also perform vendor onsite audits annually. \nCompetition \nConsumer lending is a vast and competitive market, and we compete in varying degrees with all other sources of unsecured and secured consumer credit, including banks, non-bank lenders (including retail-based lenders) and other financial technology lending platforms. Because personal loans often serve as a replacement for credit cards, we also compete with the convenience and ubiquity that credit cards represent. \nOn the lending partnership side, we compete with a variety of technology companies that aim to help lenders with the digital transformation of their business, particularly with respect to all-digital lending. This includes new products from legacy lending technology providers as well as newer companies focused entirely on lending software infrastructure for lenders. We may also face competition from lenders or companies that have not previously competed in the consumer lending market, including companies with large and experienced machine learning teams and access to vast amounts of consumer-related information that could be used in the development of their own credit risk models.\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors: \n•Constantly improving AI models; \n•Compelling loan offers to consumers that improve regularly; \n•Automated and user-friendly loan application process; \n•Cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture; \n•Combination of technology and customer acquisition for lending partners; \n•Robust and diverse lending marketplace; and \n•Brand recognition and trust. \nGovernment Regulation \n We and the loans made through our platform by our lending partners are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations and examination by various federal, state and local government authorities. While compliance with such requirements is at times complicated by our novel business model, we have resources and processes to help us comply with these rules and regulations. \nWe are currently, and expect in the future, to be subject to laws and regulations administered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). In addition to the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business, including with respect to marketing practices. Other state and federal agencies, including prudential bank regulators, state departments of financial institutions, and state attorneys general have the ability to regulate aspects of our business directly or through our lending partners. Further, we are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision and regulation by applicable agencies in each state in which we are licensed to broker, purchase, and or service loans. Regulatory oversight of our business may change over time. By way of example, in 2020, the California Consumer Financial Protection Law was enacted, which seeks to emulate the CFPB with respect to its enforcement and supervisory capabilities as well as require additional state registration for certain covered persons. We expect that regulatory examinations by both federal and state agencies will continue. \nBelow, we summarize several of the material federal and state lending, servicing and consumer protection related laws applicable to our business. Many states have laws and regulations that are similar to the federal consumer protection laws referred to below, but the degree and nature of such laws and regulations vary from state to state. For more information regarding the various federal and state laws and regulations to which we are subject or may become subject, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFederal Lending and Related Laws \nTruth in Lending Act \nThe Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, and Regulation Z, which implements it, require creditors to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information concerning certain terms and conditions of their loan and credit transactions, and to comply with certain lending practice requirements and restrictions. These requirements apply to loans facilitated or made through our platform and retail installment contracts purchased by Upstart from automotive dealerships. We also assist our lending partners with their compliance obligations, as part of the services we provide. For closed-end credit transactions, required TILA disclosures are provided to all borrowers on behalf of our lending partners, which include, among other items, the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the number of payments, the amount of the monthly payment, the presence and amount of certain fees, and the presence of certain contractual terms. For retail installment contracts, required disclosures can also include certain conditions related to Guaranteed Asset Protection waivers or other ancillary products. For HELOCs, required open-end disclosures are provided during the origination process and servicing requirements under TILA are fulfilled by a third party servicer that we oversee. TILA also regulates the advertising of credit and gives borrowers, among other things, certain rights regarding updated disclosures and the treatment of credit balances. \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract), religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or certain state laws. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, prohibits discrimination based on age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, or marital status, and restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants or engaging in certain loan-related practices, and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or \npursuing an application. These requirements apply to lending partners for loans facilitated through our platform, for automotive dealerships selling retail installment contracts, as well as to us as a service provider and as a loan originator for our HELOC product. We abide by policies and procedures implemented by our lending partners to comply with ECOA’s provisions prohibiting discouragement and discrimination. ECOA also requires creditors to provide applicants with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications, including disclosing to applicants who have been declined their rights and the reason for the denial. On behalf of our lending partners, we provide prospective borrowers who apply for a loan through our platform but are denied credit with an adverse action notice in compliance with applicable requirements. \nFair Credit Reporting Act \nThe federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, implemented by Regulation V, promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. FCRA requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report and requires that persons who report loan payment information to credit bureaus do so accurately and timely resolve disputes regarding reported information. FCRA also imposes disclosure requirements on creditors who take adverse action on credit applications based on information contained in a credit report. \nUnder FCRA, users of consumer reports must also have a process by which customers may inquire about credit information furnished to a consumer reporting agency. We, our lending partners and the automotive dealerships with whom we partner have a permissible purpose for obtaining credit reports on potential borrowers, and we also obtain explicit consent from borrowers to obtain such reports. As part of our loan servicing activities, we accurately report loan payment and delinquency information to appropriate consumer reporting agencies on behalf of our lending partners. We provide an adverse action notice to rejected applicants on behalf of each lending partner at the time the applicant is rejected that includes all the required disclosures. We also have processes in place to ensure that consumers are given “opt-out” opportunities, as required by the FCRA, regarding the sharing of their personal information. We have also implemented an identity theft prevention program, as required by FCRA and its implementing regulations. \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act \nThe federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, and Regulation F, its implementing regulation, provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of certain debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts. The FDCPA limits certain communications with third parties, imposes notice and debt validation requirements, and prohibits threatening, harassing or abusive conduct in the course of debt collection. We use our internal collection team, except for the HELOC product, and professional third-party collection agencies to service accounts, including collecting on accounts that may become delinquent. Any third-party debt collection agents we use are required to comply with the FDCPA and all other applicable laws in collecting delinquent accounts of borrowers. While our internal servicing team is not subject to the formal requirements of the FDCPA in most cases, the CFPB prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in debt collection, including first-pay debt collection, and therefore, we have established policies intended to substantially comply with the collection practice requirements under the FDCPA as an industry best practice. \nPrivacy and Data Security Laws \nWe collect and use a wide variety of information to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to the borrowers and lending partners on our platform. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, and protection of the information we acquire from our own services as well as from third-party sources, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States. The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and Regulation P, its implementing regulation, include limitations on financial institutions’ disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to non-affiliated third parties. In certain circumstances, GLBA requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by non-affiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and non-affiliated entities. Further, \nthe Federal Trade Commission’s Safeguards Rule requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive cybersecurity program containing safeguards that are appropriate for the size and complexity of our business. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information. We have a detailed privacy policy that addresses the GLBA and Safeguards Rule and is accessible from every page of our website. We work to maintain the security of consumers’ personal information, and we do not sell, rent or share such information with third parties for marketing purposes unless agreed to by the consumer or in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we take measures to safeguard the personal information of borrowers and investors and protect against unauthorized access to this information. \nConsumer Financial Protection Act \nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Projection Act, or CFPA, was signed into law. The CFPA is extensive and significant legislation that includes numerous consumer protection provisions. Among other things, the CFPA created the CFPB, which commenced operations in July 2011 and has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer financial laws, such as TILA, FCRA, and ECOA. The CFPB is also authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” or UDAAP, through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. The CFPB engages in consumer financial education, requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved customers and communities. The CFPB has regulatory and enforcement powers over most providers of consumer financial products and services through the laws it enforces, including us. It also has supervisory and examination powers over certain providers of consumer financial products and services, including large banks, payday lenders, “larger participants” in certain financial services markets defined by CFPB regulation, and non-bank entities the CFPB determines present a risk to consumers after notice and an opportunity to respond. In 2024, the CFPB for the first time exercised its right to assert supervisory authority over an entity the CFPB deemed a high risk to consumers.\nThe CFPB has imposed, and will continue to impose, restrictions on lending practices, including with respect to the terms of certain loans. We and our lending partners are subject to the CFPB’s enforcement authority. The CFPB may investigate our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. In addition, the CFPB may, in connection with its supervisory authority, also conduct on-site examinations of our HELOCs and our lending partners’ businesses on a periodic basis, subject to whether the applicable lending partner satisfies the assets threshold for CFPB supervision. If the CFPB were to conclude that our loan origination assistance or servicing activities, or any loans originated by our lending partners on our platform, violate applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to a formal or informal inquiry, investigation and/or enforcement action. We are not currently subject to any enforcement actions by the CFPB. \nFederal Trade Commission Act \nUnder Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, we and our lending partners are prohibited from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or UDAP. For nonbank financial institutions, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, is the primary regulator enforcing this prohibition, and in recent years the FTC has been focused on practices of financial technology companies. The FTC is also the primary federal regulator for automotive dealerships. Based on publicly available actions, the FTC’s primary focus has been with respect to financial technology company marketing and disclosure practices as it relates to lending products, and on junk fees. We maintain policies and procedures that require our marketing and loan application and servicing operations comply with UDAP standards. We also maintain a dealership diligence program to monitor the fees charged to consumers, including for ancillary products, for retail installment contracts we purchase from dealerships. \nFederal Trade Commissions’s Consumer Claims and Defenses Rule\nThe Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Claims and Defenses Rule, otherwise known as the Holder Rule, requires a seller to include a specific notice in every consumer credit contract informing consumers of their right to assert against the assignee of credit contracts, certain claims the consumer may have against the originator of a credit contract (such a dealer as the originating creditor in auto retail installment sales contracts). This rule \npreserves the consumer’s right to assert the same claims and defenses against anyone who purchases the contract, as they would have against the original creditor. Upstart is subject to the Holder Rule as a purchaser of retail installment contracts and therefore ensures all retail installment contracts that are purchased include such notice.\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act and NACHA Rules \nThe federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act, or EFTA, provides guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts. Under EFTA, and Regulation E that implements it, we must obtain consumer consents prior to receiving electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts, and loans offered by Upstart or through our lending partners may not condition an extension of credit on the borrower’s agreement to repay the loan through preauthorized (recurring) electronic fund transfers. In addition to compliance with federal laws, transfers performed by ACH electronic transfers are subject to detailed timing and notification rules and guidelines administered by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, or NACHA. All transfers of funds related to our operations conform to the EFTA, its regulations and NACHA guidelines. As part of our servicing activities, we obtain necessary electronic authorization from borrowers and investors for such transfers in compliance with such rules. \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \nThe federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or ESIGN, and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. ESIGN and UETA require businesses that want to use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions to get affirmative consent from consumers to receive or sign electronically any documents otherwise required by law to be “in writing”. When a consumer registers on our platform, we obtain consent to transact business electronically, for the consumer to receive electronic disclosures and for us to maintain electronic records in compliance with ESIGN and UETA requirements, and we maintain electronic signatures and records in a manner intended to support enforceability of relevant consumer agreements and consents. \nFederal Marketing Regulations \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and similar state laws, generally prohibits robocalls, including those calls made using an auto-dialer or prerecorded or artificial voice calls made to a wireless telephone without the prior express consent of the called party (or prior express written consent, if messages constitute telemarketing). In addition, the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule implements the FTC’s Do-Not-Call Registry and imposes numerous other requirements and limitations in connection with telemarketing. Our policies address the requirements of TCPA as well as FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule and other laws limiting telephone outreach. Furthermore, Upstart does not engage in prohibited activities under TCPA.\nThe Federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing, or CAN-SPAM, Act applies to commercial messages and makes it unlawful to send electronic mail messages that contain false or deceptive information, among other requirements. CAN-SPAM also requires the sender of emails set for a commercial purpose to provide a functioning mechanism that allows the recipient to opt-out of receiving future commercial e-mail messages from the sender of such messages. Our email communications with all consumers are formulated to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act. \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act \nUnder the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or SCRA, and similar state laws, there are limits on interest rates chargeable to military personnel and civil judicial proceedings against them, and there are limitations on our ability to collect on a loan to servicemembers on active duty originated prior to the servicemember entering active duty status and, in certain cases, for a period of time thereafter. The ability to repossess a vehicle is also limited under the SCRA. The SCRA requires creditors to adjust the interest rate of borrowers who qualify for and request relief. If a borrower with an outstanding loan qualifies for SCRA protection the interest rate on their loan (including \ncertain fees) will be reduced to 6% for the duration of the borrower’s active duty. During this period, any interest holder in the loan will not receive the difference between 6% and the loan’s original interest rate. \nMilitary Lending Act \nUnder the Military Lending Act, certain members of the armed forces serving on active duty and their dependents must be identified and be provided with certain protections when becoming obligated on a consumer credit transaction. These protections include: a limit on the Military Annual Percentage Rate (an all-in cost-of-credit measure which is the same as the APR for loans facilitated on our platform) of 36%, certain required disclosures before origination, a prohibition on charging prepayment penalties, a prohibition against repossessions of collateral without a court order, and a prohibition on arbitration agreements and certain other loan agreement terms. As part of the services we provide, we ensure compliance with the requirements of the Military Lending Act and state analogs that also provide protections for these consumers. \nBank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act, and U.S. Sanctions Laws \nUnder the Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or USA PATRIOT ACT, and certain U.S. sanctions laws, our lending partners are required to maintain anti-money laundering, customer due diligence and record-keeping policies and procedures, some of which we perform on behalf of our lending partners, and to avoid doing business with certain sanctioned persons or entities or certain types of sanctioned activity in specific countries. We have implemented an BSA/AML program, or AML program, designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity. Our AML program is designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate business in countries, or with persons or entities, included on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, or OFAC, and equivalent foreign authorities. Our AML compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. With respect to new borrowers, we apply the customer identification and verification program rules and screen names against the list of specially designated nationals maintained by OFAC, pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulation. \nBankruptcy Code \nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, a lender is prohibited by the automatic stay, reorganization plan and discharge provisions, among others, in seeking enforcement of debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection. The lender’s rights to repossess a vehicle subject to a loan in bankruptcy are also restricted. Our policies are designed to support compliance with the Bankruptcy Code for both secured and unsecured loans as we service both. Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and Regulation X, its implementing regulation, requires lenders and servicers of home loans to provide borrowers with pertinent and timely disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process. RESPA also prohibits specific practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations upon the use of escrow accounts. It further requires disclosures for mortgage escrow accounts at closing and annually thereafter, itemizing the charges to be paid by the borrower and what is paid out of the account by the servicer. Prior to referring a consumer to an affiliate, RESPA requires the person making each referral to provide each person to whom business is referred an Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement. Our policies are designed to support compliance with the provisions of RESPA that apply to our HELOC product.\nState Lending Regulations \nState Privacy Laws\nWe are also subject to state privacy and security laws and regulations that apply to certain personal information that we collect or otherwise process, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act and the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation. In addition, various federal, state and local legislatures and regulators have enacted or otherwise implemented data security breach notification requirements that are applicable to us.\nState Usury Limitations \nUpstart is not a lender other than for the purchase of retail installment contracts and for HELOCs originated by one of our subsidiaries. For these programs, transactions are governed by the state lending laws in which the transaction occurs. Personal loans originated on our platform are otherwise made by state- or federally chartered banks and credit unions. With respect to lending partners covered by Section 521 of the Depository Institution Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, or DIDMCA (for state-chartered, FDIC-insured lenders), or Section 85 of the National Bank Act, or NBA (for national banks), these lending partners are permitted to “export” interest rates and certain fees considered to be “interest” under federal law from the state where the lender is located for all loans originated by such lender, regardless of the usury limitations imposed by the state law of the borrower’s residence, unless, with respect to state-chartered banks, the borrower’s state has chosen to opt out of the exportation regime. Federal case law interpreting such provisions (including interpretations of the NBA under Tiffany v. National Bank of Missouri and Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Service Corporation) and relevant regulatory guidance (including FDIC advisory opinion 92-47) support this exportation right. There are comparable permissions for federally chartered credit unions under the Federal Credit Union Act. \nState Consumer Protection Laws\nMany states have consumer protection laws or laws that are analogous to the federal laws noted above, including TILA, TCPA and GLBA. The loans originated on our platform by our lending partners may be subject to state laws and regulations that impose requirements related to loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt collection, and unfair or deceptive business practices. The retail installment contracts we purchase and HELOCs are subject to state laws and regulations that impose requirements on contract disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt collection and repossession, and unfair or deceptive business practices. Our ongoing compliance program seeks to comply with these requirements. \nState Licensing/Registration \nWe hold licenses, registrations, and similar filings so that we can conduct business, including providing referral services and origination assistance to lenders on our platform and servicing and collecting loans, and purchasing retail installment contracts, and originating HELOCs, in all states and the District of Columbia where products are offered and our activities require such licensure, registration or filing. With respect to our securitization trusts, we have a national bank that serves as our owner trustee and is itself exempt from licensure. \nLicenses granted to Upstart by state regulatory agencies are subject to periodic renewal. In addition, as the product offerings of Upstart or our lending partners change, as states enact new licensing requirements or amend existing licensing laws or regulations, or as states regulators or courts adjust their interpretations of licensing statutes and regulations, we may be required to obtain additional licenses or face additional requirements under current licenses. To that end, we have a small number of applications submitted and pending to obtain additional licenses, particularly with respect to obtaining additional authorization to engage in home lending and the purchase of retail installment contracts. We are also typically required to complete an annual report (or its equivalent) to each state’s regulator for licenses we hold in that state. Those licenses also subject us to the supervisory and examination authority of state regulators. \nState licensing statutes impose a variety of requirements and restrictions, including: \n•record-keeping requirements; \n•collection and servicing practices; \n•requirements governing electronic payments, transactions, signatures and disclosures; \n•examination requirements; \n•surety bond and minimum net worth requirements; \n•financial reporting requirements; \n•notification requirements for changes in principal officers, stock ownership or corporate control; and\n•restrictions on advertising and other loan solicitation activity, as well as restrictions on loan referral or similar practices. \nFederal Securities Regulations \nSecurities Act \nUpstart and certain of our subsidiaries have relied on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for placement of asset-backed securities directly to investors or to investment bank initial purchasers, which have relied on Rule 144A and Regulation S exemptions from registration to place such asset-backed securities to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. investors, respectively. \nInvestment Advisers Act \nThe Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or IAA, contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment advisers” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that our business consists of providing a platform for consumer lending and loan financing for which investment adviser registration and regulation does not apply under applicable federal or state law, and do not believe that we or any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment adviser with either the SEC or any of the various states. \nBroker-Dealer Regulations under the Exchange Act \nWe are not currently registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act or any comparable state law. The SEC heavily regulates the manner in which broker-dealers are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in Upstart being characterized as a broker-dealer, based on guidance published by the SEC and its staff. \nABS Risk Retention Rules \nRegulation RR was jointly issued by a group of federal agencies under section 15G of the Exchange Act, as well as under the Federal Reserve Act, section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933; section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the International Banking Act of 1978. Its purpose is to require securitizers to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk of assets that the securitizer transfers or sells to an issuing entity and that collateralize asset-backed securities that are sold to a third party. We believe we have structured our organization such that we are in compliance with Regulation RR and will continue to conduct our business in a manner that allows us to remain in compliance with this regulation. \nCompliance \nWe review our policies and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us and our lending partners. We have built our systems and processes with controls in place in order to permit our policies and procedures to be followed on a consistent basis. For example, to ensure proper controls are in place to maintain compliance with the consumer protection related laws and regulations, we have developed a compliance management system consistent with the regulatory expectations published by governmental agencies. While no compliance program can assure that there will not be violations, or alleged violations, of applicable laws, we believe that our compliance management system is reasonably designed and managed to minimize compliance-related risks. \nIntellectual Property \nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trademarks, domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions, our information security infrastructure and restrictions on access to or use of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2024, we had four patents issued and four patent applications in the United States related to our proprietary risk model and data engineering. We may file additional patent applications or pursue additional patent protection in the future to the extent we believe it will be beneficial. \nWe have trademark rights in our name, our logo and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it will be beneficial. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business. We may be subject to third party claims from time to time with respect to our intellectual property. \nAdditionally, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Under such agreements, our employees, consultants and contractors are subject to invention assignment provisions designed to protect our proprietary information and ensure our ownership in intellectual property developed pursuant to such agreements. \nFor additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe have built a very special company culture at Upstart. Building the best place for top talent to do great work has been a priority for us from day one. We have received best place to work awards in both our San Mateo and Columbus locations. As our business continues recovering from the macro-economic challenges we encountered over the last couple of years, our employees remain engaged and inspired by our mission; retention of our top talent is as high as it has been since we went public in 2020.\n\nWe brought together a remarkable diversity of thinkers to build Upstart. Our co-founders and the members of our management team come from diverse backgrounds with varying ethnicities, education backgrounds, genders and ages. This diversity of thought ensures we tackle problems from all angles and arrive at the best solution for all stakeholders. \nRecruiting\nWe attract and recruit diverse, exceptionally talented, highly educated, experienced and motivated employees. We have an extremely rigorous recruiting and employee candidate screening process. For example, our machine learning team, responsible for the development and constant improvement of our AI models, is unlike any other that we are aware of in the consumer lending space. The majority of the members of this team have doctorate \ndegrees in statistics, mathematics, computer science, economics or physics and many have extensive past experience in quantitative finance.\nCulture\nThe Upstart culture is central to our talent advantage and we have carefully and thoughtfully built it as we have grown. Equity and inclusion underpin everything we do in the people programs we build. From our compensation practices to how we think about talent management and team development to the perks and benefits we invest in, each decision we make and every strategy we build is considered with the lens of ensuring we create a culture that inspires the best work from all employees, and fairly and equitably rewards results from everyone. \nUpstart employees are also passionate about building an environment that works for all. Over the last few years, we have invested heavily in growing our employee resource groups, and currently have nine employee led organizations designed to support employees in communities that matter to them. This includes our African American Employee Network, Catalyst (for our LGBTQ2IA+ community), Unidos, APU (for Asian American Upstarters), and most recently, a Veterans ERG, along with more than 20 clubs and special interest groups. \nDigital First Approach\nA few years ago, we shifted our talent location strategy to one that focused on “digital” work first. Employees in eligible roles (which comprise the majority of our full-time roles) can work from anywhere in the United States, including in one of our five offices in Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; New York, New York; or San Mateo, California. However, to ensure we continue to build relationships and capture the magic of those innovative, in-person “aha” moments, we also provide travel and onsite budgets to ensure teams can come together regularly. We believe the benefits of in-office work can be captured in just a few well-considered days together, so this flexible approach provides Upstart the best of all worlds: in-person collaboration and team building as well as access to diverse talent all over the country.\nEmployee Benefits \nIn addition to providing competitive benefits like fully paid health insurance, life insurance and disability, flexible time off for our salaried employees, and fully paid parental leave, we invest in benefits that will provide financial flexibility and financial wellness for our employees - we see this as central to our brand as an employer, and to attracting the types of employees that will be passionate about our mission to serve borrowers. We continue to provide flexible “wellness” and “productivity” budgets allowing our diverse population of employees to spend in ways that will be most useful for them. Inspired by our company mission, we also provide important traditional financial benefits like a 401(k) match (where we match 401(k) contributions up to a set dollar amount, ensuring equal access to these benefits dollars regardless of salary level), a generous Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and access to a financial planning and money management platform. We believe that these employee benefits, combined with competitive salaries and an equity program that grants restricted stock units to all full-time employees, have ensured that we remain a top employer in our industry.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 1,193 full-time employees. We also engage temporary employees, contractors and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nCorporate Information \nUpstart Network, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2012.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks and uncertainties described below should be carefully considered, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nThe material risks that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, those relating to the following:\n•Our business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.\n•If we are unable to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding to our marketplace from institutional investors or successfully manage risks associated with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•If we are unable to continue to improve our AI models or if our AI models contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n•If our AI models do not accurately reflect the impact of economic conditions on borrowers’ credit risk in a timely manner, the performance of Upstart-powered loans may be worse than anticipated and our AI models may be perceived as ineffective.\n•If we are unable to approve a significant number of borrowers for loans through our marketplace, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n•If our existing lending partners cease or limit their participation in our marketplace or if we are unable to attract new lending partners to our marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n•We have a relatively limited operating history, which may result in increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, and makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\n•If we are unable to manage the risks associated with the Upstart Macro Index (UMI), which we introduced in 2023 and which does not have a long history or proven track record, our credibility, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•We have incurred net losses, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.\n•If we are unable to manage risks associated with the loans on our balance sheet, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n•Our revenue growth rate and financial performance in the past may not be indicative of future performance. \n•Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and as a result may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n•Our loan funding arrangements with institutional investors, securitization programs and warehouse credit facilities expose us to certain risks, and if we fail to successfully manage such risks, it may result in the reduced supply of loan funding capital or require us to seek more costly or less efficient financing for our marketplace.\n•Our top three lending partners account for a significant portion of loan originations on our marketplace and our revenue.\n•Our reputation and brand are important to our success, and if we are unable to continue developing our reputation and brand, our ability to retain existing and attract new lending partners, our ability to attract borrowers to our marketplace, our ability to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding and our ability to maintain and improve our relationship with regulators of our industry could be adversely affected.\n•Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•If we are unable to manage the risks related to our loan servicing and collections obligations, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•Substantially all of our revenue is derived from a single loan product, and we are thus particularly susceptible to fluctuations in the unsecured personal loan market.\n•The sales and onboarding process of new lending partners could take longer than expected, leading to fluctuations or variability in expected revenues and results of operations.\n•We are continuing to introduce and develop new loan products and services, and if these products and services are not successful or we are unable to manage the related risks, our growth prospects, business, financial, condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•We rely on strategic relationships with loan aggregators to attract applicants to our marketplace, and if we cannot maintain effective relationships with loan aggregators or successfully replace their services, our business could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nOur business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.\nUncertainty, volatility and negative trends in general economic conditions historically have created a difficult operating environment for our industry. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, have impacted and will continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations by affecting the supply of capital to our marketplace from our lending partners and institutional investors, the demand by borrowers for Upstart-powered loans, and borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay their loans. These factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, inflation, personal savings rates, U.S. politics (including state and federal elections, changes in presidential and gubernatorial administrations and related impact to policy), fiscal and monetary policies, unemployment levels, disruptions in the banking sector, lower consumer confidence, reduced consumer discretionary spending, conditions in the housing market, immigration policies, gas prices, energy costs, government shutdowns, trade wars and delays in tax refunds, as well as events such as natural disasters, acts of war, geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, catastrophes and pandemics. If any of these factors negatively affect borrowers, lending partners or institutional investors, or if we are unable to mitigate the risks associated with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, the United States experienced historically high levels of inflation. In response, the government implemented policy interventions. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates eleven times in 2022 and 2023. While the goal was to curb inflation, these interventions may have had, and could continue to have, broad macroeconomic implications, including contributing to an economic downturn, higher unemployment rates or \ndisruptions to the banking sector. While the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in the second half of 2024 in response to indications of lower inflation levels, the timing of additional interest rate cuts, if any, is uncertain. \nThe current macroeconomic environment and resulting uncertainty and volatility have had, and could continue to have, several effects on our business and results of operations, including, among other things:\n•a decrease in loan origination volume; \n•a reduction in loan funding from lending partners and institutional investors;\n•a reduction in liquidity in the capital markets;\n•lower approval rates for, and acceptance of loan offers by, applicants;\n•increased utilization of our balance sheet to purchase Upstart-powered loans; \n•delays in the adoption of our AI lending marketplace by new lending partners;\n•increased delinquencies and default rates for Upstart-powered loans; and\n•reductions in workforce.\nThe current macroeconomic environment has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business by affecting the supply of capital to our marketplace from institutional investors and lending partners. For more information, see the risk factors titled “—If we are unable to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding to our marketplace from institutional investors, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected” and “—If our existing lending partners cease or limit their participation in our marketplace or if we are unable to attract new lending partners to our marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected”.\nWe offer consumer loans on our marketplace, and many consumers that come to our marketplace have poor, limited or no credit history. Such consumers have historically been, and may in the future be, disproportionately affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions. Inflation, higher interest rates, availability of government assistance programs, unemployment, bankruptcy, government interventions, such as stimulus measures, major medical expenses, divorce or death may affect borrowers’ ability or willingness to borrow or make payments on loans. Macroeconomic changes have in the past and may in the future negatively impact borrowers’ ability and willingness to borrow and make repayments. For more information, see the risk factors titled “—If we are unable to approve significant number of borrowers for loans through our marketplace, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.”\nDuring an economic down cycle, there is a greater risk that borrowers will not make payments on loans. Also, borrowers may not prioritize repayment of unsecured personal loans over loans that are secured by necessities, for example, mortgages, home equity loans or auto loans. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations, which may reduce the ability of borrowers to remain current on their obligations. These factors may lead to increased delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies declared by borrowers, resulting in more charge-offs and fewer recoveries, all of which have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on the credit performance of loans facilitated on our marketplace and our business. For example, the vintages of core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2024 are forecasted to underperform relative to the target returns set at the time of loan origination. When a borrower defaults on a loan, it increases our costs to service the loan. Because default rates have been higher than expected, it has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, demand by our lending partners to originate loans, and institutional investors to fund loans, facilitated through our marketplace. Any sustained decline in applicant approvability or acceptance of loan offers or loan origination volume, or any increase in delinquencies or defaults by borrowers beyond our expectation, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding to our marketplace from institutional investors or successfully manage risks associated with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on sourcing and maintaining diverse and resilient loan funding from institutional investors to our marketplace. The institutional investors provide loan funding to our marketplace by purchasing whole loans, pass-through certificates and asset-backed securities. Out of the total principal of loan originations facilitated on our marketplace during the year ended December 31, 2024, 65% were purchased by institutional investors. The availability and capacity of loan funding from institutional investors depend on many factors that are outside of our control, such as economic and market conditions, interest rates, liquidity in the capital markets and regulatory requirements or restrictions, which are subject to change. While we have experienced funding constraints since 2022 due to the macroeconomic environment, we believe the market sentiment from institutional investors has started to improve and we have since increased loan funding capacity. We cannot be sure that the existing funding sources will continue to be available, or any new funding source will become available, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Decreased funding from institutional investors has negatively impacted our business in the past, and may negatively impact us in the future. Any sustained decline in investor demand for Upstart-powered loans or securities secured by such loans for any reason, including due to adverse economic conditions or due to any increase in delinquencies, defaults or losses beyond our expectation, may adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our loan funding from institutional investors comes from committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. These arrangements may include terms that provide downside risk protection, subject to certain limits and conditions. In particular, we have agreed to compensate certain investors, subject to a limit, if credit performance on the loans under these arrangements deviates from our initial expectations and, subject to certain conditions, if we are unable to sell the minimum required volume of loans to our committed capital providers. As such, if the loans do not perform as expected due to unexpected shifts in borrower behaviors, ability to pay or otherwise, if we have a decrease in borrower demand for Upstart-powered loans, or if our models’ expectation for credit performance is inaccurate for any reason, our financial results could be adversely impacted. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum exposure to losses under these committed capital and other co-investment arrangements was approximately $459.3 million. This amount has grown from $98.5 million as of December 31, 2023, as we have entered into more committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. As the amount of our maximum exposure to losses under these arrangements grows and may continue to grow in the future, risks associated with committed capital and other co-investment arrangements could have a greater impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Committed capital and other co-investment arrangements have negatively impacted our financial results through unfavorable fair value adjustments and may continue to do so in the future. We may also experience declines in revenue and transaction volume if existing committed capital or other capital arrangements do not provide funding on the agreed upon terms or we fail to secure additional committed capital or other capital arrangements in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, the capital arrangements that we have recently entered into during a high interest rate environment, such as the committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, may become more costly if interest rates continue to fall and the terms of such arrangements remain in place. Despite our efforts, we may continue to experience funding constraints and cannot be certain if any measures we have taken, such as committed capital or other co-investment arrangements, or will take to address or mitigate the effects of funding constraints, will be sufficient or successful. In the event of funding constraints, we may not be able to maintain our current loan origination volume without incurring substantially higher funding costs, agreeing to terms that are not favorable to us or relying on our balance sheet to support funding, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain about the level of investor demand for securitizations. Events of default or breaches of financial, performance or other covenants, or worse than expected performance of certain pools of loans underpinning our asset-backed securitizations, debt facilities or other structured and unstructured transactions, have limited in the past and could limit our access to funding from institutional investors. For example, the loans originated in 2021 through 2023 that were included in our asset-backed securitizations have underperformed relative \nto their expected target returns at the time of origination, resulting in negative rating agency actions in several of our asset-based securitizations. \nIf we are unable to continue to improve our AI models or if our AI models contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract potential borrowers, and thus increase loan originations on our marketplace, depends in large part on our ability to effectively evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers and likelihood of default and, based on that evaluation, offer competitively priced loans. Our overall operating efficiency and margins further depend in part on our ability to maintain a high degree of automation in our application process and achieve incremental improvements in the degree of automation. If our AI models fail to adequately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers and the likelihood of default due to the design of our models or programming or any other errors or inaccuracies, and our AI models do not detect or account for such errors or inaccuracies, or any of the other components of our credit decisioning process fails, there could be higher than forecasted losses on Upstart-powered loans. Any of the foregoing could result in sub-optimally priced loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans, any of which may lead to lower demand by borrowers and reduce loan originations and our revenue. Moreover, in addition to reduced borrower demand, higher than expected losses on Upstart-powered loans could further harm our ability to attract lending partners and/or capital to our marketplace. Our lending partners and institutional investors may decide to limit their funding or reduce the number of loans or types of loans they originate or fund if they experience higher than expected losses due to underperformance of the loans. The underperformance of Upstart-powered loans as compared to the expectations set by our AI models can have a negative impact on our financial results, as while subject to certain limits, we are obligated in certain arrangements to provide downside risk protection to our capital partners and compensate them for any deviation in expected credit performance of the loans sold in connection with the committed capital and other co-investment arrangements. It may also hinder our ability to increase the size of, or enter into new, debt facilities or other financing arrangements.\nOur AI models also target, optimize or predict other aspects of the lending process, such as borrower acquisition, fraud detection, default timing, loan stacking and prepayment timing. Our continued improvements to such models have allowed us to facilitate loans inexpensively and virtually instantly, with a high degree of consumer satisfaction while maintaining loan performance. However, such applications of our AI models may prove to be less predictive than we expect, or than they have been in the past, for a variety of reasons, including inaccurate assumptions or other errors made in constructing such models, incorrect interpretations of the results of such models and failure to update model assumptions and parameters in a timely manner. It is also possible that the instant approval process on our marketplace makes us a target for certain borrowers who intend to accumulate as much debt as quickly as possible without regard for the viability of repayment. Additionally, such models may not be able to effectively account for matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control, such as macroeconomic conditions, credit market volatility and interest rate fluctuations, which often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables and factors. Material errors or inaccuracies in such AI models could lead us to make inaccurate or sub-optimal operational or strategic decisions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our AI models do not accurately reflect the impact of economic conditions on borrowers’ credit risk in a timely manner, the performance of Upstart-powered loans may be worse than anticipated and our AI models may be perceived as ineffective.\nThe performance of loans facilitated through our marketplace is significantly dependent on the effectiveness of our proprietary AI models used to evaluate a borrower’s credit profile and likelihood of default. Our AI models have not been extensively tested during different types of economic downturns or recessions. Even if credit decisions take into account macroeconomic conditions, there is no assurance that our AI models can accurately predict loan performance during periods of adverse economic conditions or quickly respond to changing economic conditions. If our AI models are unable to accurately reflect the credit risk of loans under such economic conditions, we, our lending partners and our institutional investors would experience greater than expected losses on such loans, which would harm our reputation and erode the trust we have built with our lending partners and \ninstitutional investors. We have experienced and may continue to experience high delinquency rates and underperformance of loans originated using our AI models in recent periods. For example, the quarterly vintages of core personal loans that originated in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2024 are forecasted to underperform relative to the target returns set at the time of loan origination. The fair value of the loans on our balance sheet has declined and may continue to decline. Our business, financial condition and results of operations can continue to be adversely affected if our AI models are not able to accurately and timely assess the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the performance and default rates of loans facilitated through our marketplace. \nIf we are unable to approve a significant number of borrowers for loans through our marketplace, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe vast majority of our revenue comes from platform and referral fees and servicing fees on loans facilitated through our marketplace. Growing our revenue from fees depends in significant part on our ability to increase the transaction volume of consumer loans on our marketplace. To serve more consumer demand for credit and increase transaction volume on our marketplace, we must have an adequate supply of capital from lending partners and institutional investors, we must drive sufficient demand from potential borrowers seeking loans, and the borrowers must satisfy the requirements for approval established by our models and our lending partners. \nWhile we continue to improve the accuracy of our AI models, which we believe is key to our long-term success, such improvements may not lead to more borrowers being approved on our platform. These improvements have led us in the past and may lead us in the future to reevaluate our credit decisioning process, including the risks associated with certain borrowers. Changes in borrower default patterns and increases in the numbers of borrowers who default have in the past and could in the future result in fewer borrowers being approved for loans on our platform. In addition, our lending partners' credit requirements and the target returns our institutional investors and lending partners demand in order to provide capital to our marketplace have, and could continue to, negatively impact our ability to extend loan offers with competitive terms or at all to certain borrowers on our marketplace. If we are not able to fill funding commitments by our institutional investors or lending partners, we risk jeopardizing our current or future supply of capital to our marketplace.\nIn the current macroeconomic environment with elevated costs of borrowing and risks associated with consumer credit, the pool of qualified borrowers has become smaller, and fewer applicants have received or accepted loan offers on our marketplace than they have in the past. Approving more borrowers can also be limited as we have historically held the maximum annual percentage rate of Upstart-powered loans to 35.99% or less due to regulatory reasons. Moreover, loan terms have become less borrower-friendly in the current environment with higher interest rates, and we have experienced an overall decrease in borrower demand. These factors have and may continue to negatively affect transaction volume on our marketplace and therefore our revenue. If we are not able to maintain or increase transaction volume on our marketplace, or attract and retain qualified borrowers, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. \nIf our existing lending partners cease or limit their participation in our marketplace or if we are unable to attract new lending partners to our marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in significant part on the participation of our lending partners in our marketplace. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 83% of our total revenue was generated from platform, referral and servicing fees that we receive from our lending partners. Our lending partners also provide loan funding to our marketplace by retaining a significant portion of the loans facilitated through our marketplace. Out of the total principal of loan originations facilitated on our marketplace during the year ended December 31, 2024, 25% were retained by our lending partners. If we are unable to keep existing lending partners or attract new lending partners to our marketplace, or if we are unable to maintain or increase the portion of loans retained by the lending partners, our financial performance could suffer.\nOur lending partners may suspend, limit or cease their participation in our marketplace for a number of reasons. While lending partners’ loan funding to our marketplace has started to improve, we have experienced a reduction of loan originations by lending partners in the past due to disruptions in the banking sector and adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our lending partners suspend, limit or cease their operations or terminate their relationships with us, the number of loans facilitated through our marketplace will decrease and our revenue will be adversely affected. Moreover, new lending partners may find our sales and onboarding process to be long and unpredictable. If we are unable to timely onboard our lending partners, or if our lending partners are not willing to work with us to complete an onboarding process, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe enter into a separate agreement with each of our lending partners. Our agreements with our lending partners are nonexclusive and may contain minimum fee amounts. Our lending partners could decide to stop working with us, ask to modify their agreement terms in a cost prohibitive manner when their agreement is up for renewal or enter into exclusive or more favorable relationships with our competitors. In addition, federal or state regulators may require that they terminate or otherwise limit their business with us, or impose regulatory pressure limiting their ability to do business with us. See the risk factors titled “—Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “—The CFPB has sometimes taken expansive views of its authority to regulate consumer financial services, creating uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other agency could impact our business” for more information. Moreover, we could in the future have disagreements or disputes with any of our lending partners, which could negatively impact or threaten our relationship with them. In our agreements with lending partners, we make certain representations and warranties and covenants concerning our compliance with specific policies of a lending partner, certain procedures and guidelines related to laws and regulations applicable to our lending partners, as well as the services to be provided by us. If those representations and warranties were not accurate when made or if we fail to perform a covenant, we may be liable for any resulting damages, including potentially any losses associated with impacted loans, and our reputation and ability to continue to attract new lending partners would be adversely affected. Additionally, our lending partners may engage in mergers, acquisitions or consolidations with each other, our competitors or with third parties, any of which could be disruptive to our existing and prospective relationships with our lending partners. If we fail to maintain or grow the number of lending partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a relatively limited operating history, which may result in increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, and makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\nWe were founded in 2012 and have been a publicly traded company for a limited number of years. Our limited operating history may make it difficult to make accurate predictions about our future performance. Assessing our business and future prospects may also be difficult because of the risks and difficulties we face. These risks and difficulties include our ability to:\n•successfully mitigate any adverse effects of economic conditions such as high interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, personal savings rates and other macroeconomic factors on our business;\n•improve the effectiveness and predictiveness of our AI models, including successfully adjusting our proprietary AI models, products and services in a timely manner in response to changing macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in the credit market;\n•maintain and increase the volume of loans facilitated through our AI lending marketplace;\n•successfully maintain diverse and resilient loan funding to our marketplace from institutional investors;\n•attract new lending partners to our marketplace and maintain existing lending partnerships;\n•successfully meet our borrower demand with competitive products and terms;\n•offer competitive interest rates to borrowers on our marketplace, while enabling our lending partners and institutional investors to achieve an adequate return over their cost of funds;\n•successfully build our brand and protect our reputation from negative publicity;\n•increase the effectiveness of our marketing strategies;\n•continue to expand the number of potential borrowers;\n•comply with and successfully adapt to complex and evolving regulatory environments;\n•protect against increasingly sophisticated fraudulent borrowing and online theft;\n•successfully compete with companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of providing online lending services to financial institutions or consumer financial services to borrowers;\n•enter into new markets and introduce new products and services;\n•effectively secure and maintain the confidentiality of the information received, accessed, stored, provided and used across our systems;\n•successfully obtain and maintain corporate funding and liquidity to support growth and for general corporate purposes;\n•attract, integrate and retain qualified employees; and\n•effectively manage and expand the capabilities of our operations teams, outsourcing relationships and other business operations.\nIf we are not able to timely and effectively address these risks and difficulties as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage the risks associated with the Upstart Macro Index (UMI), which we introduced in 2023 and which does not have a long history or proven track record, our credibility, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUMI is our effort to quantify the level of macroeconomic risks in terms of the losses or defaults within Upstart-powered unsecured personal loan portfolios, excluding small dollar loans. We introduced UMI in 2023 and it does not have a long history or track record. Since it is a relatively new initiative, UMI remains unproven and, therefore, may not perform as expected. We intend to continue our research and development efforts to improve UMI. In light of such efforts, we have revised our previously published UMI values, including to remove seasonal patterns, and may further change or revise the current or past UMI values in the future. Any significant changes or revisions could harm our reputation and credibility with our lending partners and institutional investors, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the correlation between UMI and the level of macroeconomic risks in terms of losses or defaults within Upstart-powered unsecured personal loan portfolios may not be as significant or meaningful as we expect. If the correlation between UMI and the level of macroeconomic risks is misaligned or skewed in a way that is unacceptable to our lending partners or institutional investors, or UMI fails to accurately or adequately quantify the level of macroeconomic risks, this lack of a meaningful correlation may result in distrust or disregard of UMI. This outcome could adversely affect our reputation and credibility with our lending partners and institutional investors and thus, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUMI is based on our analysis of the losses within Upstart-powered unsecured personal loan portfolios, excluding small dollar loans, and is specific to our borrower base. Because the composition of our borrower base changes over time and UMI is an aggregate computed across all Upstart-powered unsecured personal loans, except small dollar loans, UMI may not be the best indicator of the level of macroeconomic risks for a specific subset of loans or borrower segments. UMI is not intended to measure the macroeconomic risks in terms of losses of loan portfolios or assets that are not Upstart-powered loans, including loans held by other segments of the U.S. population. It is not designed to measure the current state of the overall economy or to measure or predict future macroeconomic conditions, trends or risks. It is also not designed to measure or predict Upstart’s future loan performance, results of operations or stock price. Investors, lending partners and analysts may improperly use or rely \non UMI for these or other unintended purposes, or otherwise misunderstand or misinterpret UMI. If UMI is misunderstood or misinterpreted in these ways, it could harm our reputation and credibility with our lending partners and institutional investors and impair our ability to retain and attract them to our lending marketplace. This could further reduce the number or types of loan products that our lending partners and institutional investors are willing to fund. Any failure to manage the foregoing risks could adversely affect our ability to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding to our marketplace, which in turn would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred net losses, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $128.6 million. We have expended, and intend to continue to expend, significant funds to develop and improve our proprietary AI models, attract additional borrowers to our marketplace, enhance the features and overall user experience on our platform, expand loan product offerings and otherwise continue to grow our business, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset these significant expenditures. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant losses for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this section, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, macroeconomic conditions and other unknown events. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses would prevent us from being profitable. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage risks associated with the loans on our balance sheet, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have held more Upstart-powered loans on our balance sheet in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. We have used, and may continue to use, our balance sheet to support our research and development activities for new loan products and borrower segments. In addition to research and development activities, we have used and may continue to use our balance sheet to purchase Upstart-powered loans from lending partners to address fluctuations in supply and demand in our marketplace and periodically sell these loans to institutional investors prior to their maturity. Out of the total principal of loan originations facilitated on our marketplace during the year ended December 31, 2024, 10% were held on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, we held $703.4 million of loans on our balance sheet, excluding loans held in consolidated securitization. We hold loans on our balance sheet at fair value and estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology. An increase in the market interest rates reduces the fair value of loans held on our balance sheet by increasing the discount rate used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flow methodology. Currently, we are in a high interest rate environment. The high interest rates have negatively affected the fair value of loans held on our balance sheet and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, for these loans and any future loans to be held on our balance sheet, we bear the credit risk in the event of borrower default. Our exposure to rising borrower default rates and their volatility has increased, and may continue to increase, as we hold more Upstart-powered loans on our balance sheet. The R&D loans make up a substantial portion of the loans held on our balance sheet and are generally more risky and more likely to default than the core personal loans. \nAt times, the default rates and charge-offs for these loans have been higher than expected for certain loan categories, and consequently, we had to make unfavorable fair value adjustments to the loans on our balance sheet. Unfavorable fair value adjustments have negatively impacted our revenue in the past, and if we experience higher than expected default rates or the loans otherwise fail to perform as expected, we would need to make unfavorable fair value adjustments in the future, which would negatively impact our revenue. It is also possible that we may recognize a loss if we sell the loans held on our balance sheet, such as the R&D loans, at an unfavorable price. Furthermore, a portion of our revenue is interest income derived from the loans held on our balance sheet, and if we increase the amount of loans held on our balance sheet, we become more dependent on interest income as a source of revenue and become more vulnerable to credit risk and borrower defaults associated with these loans. From a liquidity perspective, a growing amount of loans on our balance sheet increases our liquidity risk. We cannot be certain whether we will be able to sell loans currently on our balance sheet, or any future loans to be put on our balance sheet, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, it is possible that our ability to \nmeet our operational needs and obligations may be disrupted. Moreover, the use of our balance sheet diverts financial resources from other uses, such as improving our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \nOur revenue growth rate and financial performance in the past may not be indicative of future performance.\nWe grew rapidly in the past, and our historical revenue growth rate and financial performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our revenue for any previous quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as any indication of our revenue or revenue growth in the future. Our revenue may decline in the future for a number of reasons, which may include: adverse macroeconomic conditions, changing interest rates, slowing demand for or reduced funding through our lending marketplace, sales of loans held on our balance sheet at a loss, losses from our committed capital and co-investment arrangements with institutional capital partners, increasing competition, credit market volatility, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. \nWe believe our growth was driven in large part by our AI models and our continued improvements to our AI models. Future incremental improvements to our AI models may not lead to the same level of growth as they did in the past. In addition, we believe our past growth was driven in part by our ability to rapidly streamline and automate the loan application and origination process on our platform. We expect the Percentage of Loans Fully Automated to level off and remain relatively stable in the long term. However, the expansion of loan offerings on our platform beyond unsecured personal loans, such as auto financing and home equity lines of credit, may cause fluctuations of such percentage from period to period depending on the loan offering mix. As a result of these factors, our revenue may further decline, and our financial performance may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and as a result may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, net income (loss) and other key metrics, are likely to vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an accurate indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include but are not limited to:\n•general economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, recessions, interest rate changes, inflation, tightening of credit markets and disruptions in the banking sector;\n•our cost of borrowing money and access to loan funding sources;\n•our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictiveness of our AI models, including improvements that negatively impact transaction volume, such as lower approval rates;\n•our ability to attract new lending partners and institutional investors to our marketplace;\n•our ability to maintain relationships with existing lending partners and institutional investors;\n•our ability to maintain or increase loan volumes, and improve loan mix and the channels through which the loans, lending partners and loan funding are sourced;\n•our ability to maintain effective relationships with loan aggregators from which prospective borrowers access our website;\n•our ability to identify and prevent fraudulent activity and the impact of fraud prevention measures;\n•changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet;\n•the timing and success of new products and services;\n•the effectiveness of our direct marketing and other marketing channels;\n•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to maintaining and expanding our business, operations and infrastructure, including acquiring new and maintaining existing lending partners and institutional investors and attracting borrowers to our marketplace;\n•the number and extent of prepayments of loans facilitated on our platform;\n•the availability and integrity of our network, products and services or infrastructure, or actual or perceived security breaches or incidents experienced by us or third parties that we rely on to operate our business;\n•our involvement in litigation or regulatory enforcement efforts (or the threat thereof) or those that impact our industry generally;\n•the length of the onboarding process related to acquisitions of new lending partners;\n•changes in laws and regulations, or interpretations of such laws and regulations, that impact our business; and\n•changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or the development of competitive products by larger well-funded incumbents.\nIn addition, we typically experience seasonality in the demand for Upstart-powered loans, which is generally lower in the first quarter. This seasonal slowdown is primarily attributable to high loan demand around the holidays in the fourth quarter and the general increase in borrowers’ available cash flows in the first quarter, including cash received from tax refunds, which temporarily reduces borrowing needs. Such seasonality and other fluctuations in our quarterly results may also adversely affect and, increase the volatility of, the trading price of our common stock.\nOur loan funding arrangements with institutional investors, securitizations and warehouse credit facilities expose us to certain risks, and if we fail to successfully manage such risks, it may result in the reduced supply of loan funding capital or require us to seek more costly or less efficient financing for our marketplace.\nWe have facilitated securitizations, and may in the future facilitate additional securitizations, of Upstart-powered loans to allow our institutional investors, certain lending partners and/or ourselves to liquidate or finance such loans through the asset-backed securities markets or through other capital markets products. In asset-backed securities transactions, we sell and convey pools of loans to a special purpose entity, or SPE. We likewise fund certain loans on our balance sheet by selling loans to warehouse trust SPEs and drawing on the associated warehouse credit facilities. Each securitization SPE issues notes and/or certificates pursuant to the terms of indentures and trust agreements. In the case of the warehouse credit facilities, the warehouse trust SPE borrows money from banks pursuant to credit and security agreements. The securities issued by the SPEs in asset-backed securitization transactions and the lines of credit borrowed by the warehouse SPEs are each secured by the pool of loans owned by the applicable SPE. We, our institutional investors who have purchased whole loans or pass-through certificates, and/or our lending partners contribute loans to the SPE and in exchange, receive cash and/or securities representing debt and/or equity interests in such SPE. \nWhen we are the sole sponsor of securitizations, we are required under Regulation RR to retain at least five percent of the credit risk in such transactions for a specific period of time, depending on the type of asset that is securitized. We have in the past and may choose in the future to retain additional securities, such as notes or certificates, issued in asset-backed securitization transactions we sponsor or facilitate. The certificates represent residual equity interests in the SPEs and are subordinated to the notes and thus are exposed to greater credit risk. In 2023 and 2024, we acted as a sole retaining sponsor to asset-backed securitizations and, in one instance, retained not only the securities required for risk retention purposes under Regulation RR, but also additional residual equity interests, exposing us to greater credit risk. The securities we retain may lose value, including becoming worthless. In the future, we may retain securities issued as part of our securitizations beyond risk retention requirements again. In addition, other matters, such as capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding asset-backed securities or increasing competition from other issuers of asset-backed securities, could negatively impact our business by decreasing institutional investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the \nDodd-Frank Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, the so-called “Volcker Rule,” and states licensing requirement changes to include SPEs, may affect the type of securitizations that we are able to complete.\nIf it is not possible or economical for us to securitize loans in the future or for us to serve as risk retention holder in securitizations for the benefit of our investors who have purchased whole loans or pass-through certificates and/or our lending partners, we may need to seek alternative financing to provide loan funding to our marketplace and to meet our existing debt obligations. Such funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the cost of such loan funding mechanisms were to be higher than that of our securitizations it would negatively impact our results of operations. If we are unable to access such financing, our ability to originate loans and our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nThe servicing fees generated by our loan servicing activities for the loans sold to institutional investors and contributed to asset-based securitizations and pass-through certificate transactions also represent a material portion of our earnings. There is no assurance that our institutional investors will continue to purchase loans or securities (either through whole loan sales, asset-backed securities, pass-through certificate issuances or other direct or indirect purchase arrangements) or that they will continue to purchase loans in transactions that generate the same spreads and/or fees that we have historically obtained. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold loans that had been originated in an earlier, lower interest rate environment. We recognized losses on these sales which reduced our revenue. As we purchase and hold more loans on our balance sheet, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, including further reductions in revenue. Factors that may affect demand by institutional investors for Upstart-powered loans include:\n•competition in the whole loan sales markets where we compete with loan originators who can sell either larger loan portfolios or loans that have characteristics, pricing and terms that may be perceived to be more desirable to certain institutional investors than those offered in Upstart-powered loans that comprise our whole loan sales;\n•competition in the securitization markets where we compete with loan originators and other issuers who can securitize or sell pools of loans (which such pools may include Upstart-powered loans, on a commingled basis or otherwise) with characteristics, pricing and terms that may be perceived to be more desirable to certain institutional investors than those offered in Upstart-powered loans contributed to asset-based securitization transactions that we facilitate;\n•the extent to which servicing fees and other expenses may reduce overall net return on purchased pools of loans;\n•the actual or perceived credit performance of loan products offered through our marketplace;\n•economic conditions such as high interest rates, inflation, economic volatility and other macroeconomic factors;\n•risk appetite of our institutional investors;\n•the loan grade and term mix of the portfolios of loans offered for sale;\n•institutional investors’ sector and company investment diversification requirements and strategies;\n•higher yielding investment opportunities at a risk profile deemed similar to our sold loan portfolios;\n•borrower prepayment behavior within the underlying pools;\n•regulatory or investment practices related to maintaining net asset value, mark-to-market and similar metrics surrounding pools of purchased loans; and\n•the ability of our institutional investors to access funding and liquidity channels, including warehouse financing and securitization markets, on terms they find acceptable to deliver an appropriate return net of funding costs, as well as general economic conditions and market trends, such as increasing interest rates, that affect the appetite for loan financing investments.\nIn connection with our committed capital and other co-investment arrangements, we have agreed to compensate our loan buyers/co-investors, subject to a limit, if credit performance on the loans deviates from expectations. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum exposure to losses under these committed capital and other co-investment arrangements was approximately $459.3 million. See “Note 4. Beneficial Interests” for more information. Committed capital and other co-investment arrangements could negatively impact our financial results. We may also experience declines in revenue and loan volume if existing committed capital or other co-investment arrangements do not provide funding on the agreed upon terms or we fail to secure additional committed capital or other capital arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. \nWe are also subject to risk that arises from our derivative instruments, beneficial interests, warehouse facilities, and third-party custodians. These activities generally involve an exchange of obligations with unaffiliated lenders or other individuals or entities, referred to in such transactions as “counterparties”. If a counterparty were to default or otherwise fail to perform, we could potentially be exposed to loss if such counterparty were unable to meet its obligations to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur top three lending partners account for a significant portion of loan originations on our marketplace and our revenue.\nOur top three lending partners originate a significant portion of loans on our marketplace. In the year ended December 31, 2024, our top three lending partners collectively originated 82% of the Transaction Volume, Number of Loans and accounted for 63% of our total revenue. There are no minimum commitments for our lending partners to originate any volume of loans under our agreements. If our top three lending partners were to suspend, limit or cease their operations or otherwise terminate their relationship with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 100 lending partners participating on our marketplace, and we continue to expand our lending partnerships to new participants. If we are unable to continue to increase the participation by other lending partners on our marketplace, we will continue to be reliant on a small number of lending partners for a significant portion of loan originations and revenue, which could harm our business. \nOur reputation and brand are important to our success, and if we are unable to continue developing our reputation and brand, our ability to retain existing and attract new lending partners, our ability to attract borrowers to our marketplace, our ability to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding and our ability to maintain and improve our relationship with regulators of our industry could be adversely affected.\nWe believe maintaining a strong brand and trustworthy reputation is critical to our success and our ability to attract borrowers to our marketplace, attract new lending partners, maintain diverse and resilient loan funding and sustain good relations with regulators. Factors that affect our brand and reputation include: perceptions of AI, our industry and our company, including the quality and reliability of our AI lending marketplace; the accuracy of our AI models; characterizations of our company due to our novel business model; perceptions regarding the application of AI to consumer lending specifically and that algorithmic-based lending is inherently biased; perceptions of rate exportation and the bank partnership model; the reputation of the vehicle dealerships with which we partner; loan funding to our marketplace; changes to the Upstart marketplace; our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower complaints; collection practices; privacy and data security practices; litigation, such as class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits described in “Legal” section under “Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies”; regulatory activity; and the overall user experience of our marketplace. Negative publicity or negative public perception of these factors, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nFor example, consumer advocacy groups, state legislatures, politicians and certain government and media reports have advocated governmental action to prohibit or severely restrict consumer loan arrangements where banks contract with a third-party platform such as ours to provide origination assistance services to bank customers. Such criticism has frequently been levied in the context of high-interest “payday” loans, although other entities operating programs through which loans similar to Upstart-powered loans are originated have also faced criticism. In addition, some state legislatures are now challenging the right of state-chartered banks to export their home-state \nrates to other states by proposing, threatening to propose, or passing laws that opt out of the federal Depository Institution Deregulation Monetary Control Act, or DIDMCA. Opting out purportedly prevents out-of-state, state-chartered banks from exporting the rates from their home state for loans made to residents of the state that opted out. Iowa opted out of DIDMCA in the 1980s and in 2023, Colorado passed a law to opt out. The Colorado law is currently subject to an injunction that prevents enforcement, pending outcome of litigation regarding the effectiveness of such opt out. The high-interest loans that have been subject to more frequent criticism and challenge are fundamentally different from Upstart-powered consumer loans in many ways, including that Upstart-powered loans typically have lower interest rates and longer terms, and are not refinanced. In particular, interest rates of Upstart-powered consumer loans have always been and are currently less than 36% APR, as compared to the triple-digit interest rates of many payday or small dollar loans that have been subject to such criticism. However, states that are addressing their marketplace lending and rate exportation concerns through legislation may impact our marketplace if the state rate limit is below 36%. Where that happens, our state-chartered lending partners may need to scale back lending on our marketplace to comply with state laws or may terminate their participation in our marketplace, leading to a reduction in origination volume. These challenges to the marketplace lending model could also negatively impact demand for Upstart-powered loans, our ability to attract new lending partners, our ability to attract loan funding to our marketplace or reduce the number of potential borrowers to our marketplace. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny negative publicity or public perception of Upstart-powered loans or other similar consumer loans or the consumer lending services we provide may also result in us being subject to more restrictive laws and regulations and potential investigations and enforcement actions. For example, some unfair or deceptive practices by vehicle dealerships can be attributed to us as a purchaser of retail installment contracts under the FTC Holder Rule, which allows a vehicle purchaser to bring any claim it has against the dealership against the current holder of the retail installment contract. Borrowers may complain about our data sharing practices, even though such practices are described in our privacy policy and comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, regulators may decide they are no longer supportive of our AI lending marketplace if there is enough negative perception surrounding the use of AI or the bank partnership model. We may also become subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, or other challenges such as government enforcement or arbitration, against our lending partners or us for loans originated by our lending partners on our marketplace, loans we service or have serviced, loans we hold for sale or investment on our balance sheet, or retail installment contracts we have purchased. If there are changes in the laws or in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws affecting consumer loans similar to those offered on our marketplace, or our marketing and servicing of such loans, or if we become subject to such lawsuits, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAI and related technologies are subject to public debate and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Although policy prerogatives of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) may change with the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration, the CFPB previously indicated that AI was a regulatory hot topic for the agency, including the use of complex credit scoring models as part of the loan underwriting process. The agency previously took several steps to increase regulatory scrutiny of financial technology companies that rely on AI. In April 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the CFPB, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) released a joint statement on AI demonstrating their interest in monitoring the development and use of automated systems and enforcement of their respective laws and regulations. The Congressional Research Service released a report on April 3, 2024 on the use of AI and machine learning in financial services, noting that financial industry policymakers face competing pressures of providing beneficial technology and avoiding any consumer harm from such technology. In addition, recently, the SEC cautioned companies against “AI washing” and took enforcement actions against companies for their claims about the use of AI in their products and services. In June 2024, the Treasury Department also issued a request for information seeking public comments on the use of AI in the financial services sector and the opportunities and risks presented by developments and applications of AI within the sector. In August 2024, the CFPB also responded to a Department of Treasury Request For Information regarding the use of AI in financial services, reinforcing their expectation that companies using emerging technologies including AI comply with existing consumer protection laws and regulations. States have also started to regulate the use of AI, with Colorado passing the first comprehensive AI bill in June 2024. That same month, Colorado passed its AI Act, creating duties for developers of AI and persons using AI to use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination arising from the use of \"high-risk AI systems”. California attempted to pass a \nsimilar law, but was not successful. Other states have begun proposing and passing legislation addressing the use of AI and automated decision making, and we expect the number of states with similar legislation to grow. Any negative publicity or negative public perception of AI could negatively impact demand for our AI lending marketplace, hinder our ability to attract new lending partners or slow the rate at which lending partners adopt our AI lending marketplace. From time to time, certain advocacy groups have made claims that unlawful or unethical discriminatory effects may result from the use of AI technology by various companies, including ours. Such claims, whether or not accurate, and whether or not concerning us or our AI lending marketplace, may harm our ability to attract prospective borrowers to our marketplace, retain existing and attract new lending partners and achieve regulatory acceptance of our business.\nIn 2020, we entered into an agreement with the NAACP Legal Defense Education Fund (the “LDF”), and the Student Borrower Protection Center (the “SBPC”), to participate in fair lending reviews of our AI underwriting models by an independent third-party firm, Relman Colfax LLC (“Relman”). The fair lending testing was designed to determine if our AI underwriting models have caused or resulted in a disparate impact on any protected class, and if so, whether there are any alternative, less discriminatory practices that could be employed without sacrificing the models’ predictiveness. In March 2024, following a number of quantitative assessments and prior reports, Relman published a final report that summarized developments during the monitorship as well as industry fair lending recommendations. The Relman final report marked the conclusion of our agreement with the LDF and the SBPC and the fair lending reviews by Relman. If the conclusion of the Relman monitorship or any of the final report’s findings are viewed negatively for any reason, our brand and reputation and the overall market acceptance of, and trust in, our AI lending marketplace could suffer, and we could be subject to increased regulatory and litigation risk. In addition, the publication of information arising from our agreement with the LDF and the SBPC, including the reports published by Relman, could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny for us or our lending partners.\nWe have been subject to other governmental inquiries on this topic. See the risk factor titled “—We have been in the past and may in the future be subject to federal and state regulatory inquiries regarding our business” for more information. The CFPB issued a final rule in June 2024 that will require us and other non-bank entities to report any public regulatory or court orders related to violations of consumer protection laws in a registry that will be available to the public, which can impact our public perception and reputation. Negative public perception, actions by advocacy groups or legislative and regulatory interest groups could lead to lobbying for and enactment of more restrictive laws and regulations that impact the use of AI technology in general, AI technology as applied to lending operations generally or as used in our applications more specifically. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHarm to our reputation can also arise from many other sources, including inaccurate or unfavorable statements made by securities analysts or others, failure by us or our lending partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, loan underperformance, inadequate protection of borrower information and compliance failures and claims, and employee or former employee misconduct, misconduct by outsourced service providers or other counterparties, as further described below. If we are unable to protect our reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations at a federal, state and local level, that are aimed at providing consumer protections in the financial services industry. This body of laws and regulations applicable to our business is complex, evolving and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to the lack of specificity regarding the application of AI and related technologies to the already highly regulated consumer lending industry or to changing sentiments about the bank partnership model. As a result, the application of such laws and regulations in practice may change or develop over time as more products are offered on our marketplace, and through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nNew laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and the emergence of AI and related technologies. Recent financial, political and other events, including disruptions in the banking sector, may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on financial technology companies. As we expand our business into new markets, introduce new financial products and services, and as we continue to improve and evolve our AI models, additional regulatory requirements will apply. In some cases, state licenses are required based on our business operations and regulatory bodies could reject our applications for licenses or deny renewals, delay or impede our ability to operate, charge us fees or levy fines or penalties, commence investigations or inquiries into our business practices, or otherwise disrupt our ability to operate our AI lending marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also face additional regulatory scrutiny or supervision at a federal level. For example, in February 2024 and again in December 2024, the CFPB exercised a previously dormant provision of Dodd Frank to establish supervisory authority over non-bank entities based on its belief such entities posed risk to consumers. If the CFPB decides to subject us to its supervisory process, it could significantly increase the level of regulatory scrutiny of our business practices. \nFederal and state regulators have also focused on eliminating or regulating “junk fees”, which are often not well defined. The CFPB has identified the fees associated with the sale of ancillary products in connection with financing the purchase of an auto as having the potential to be unfair or deceptive. More recently, the FTC finalized a rule on junk fees and narrowed the scope of the industries covered to exclude financial services. However, the increased focus on fees in the financial services space by federal and state regulators will likely continue. Should any of the fees charged to borrowers on loans obtained through our marketplace be deemed unfair or deceptive, such fees may be subject to refund or deemed uncollectable.\nThe CFPB has the ability to regulate and investigate our business activity and has increased their activity and scrutiny in the financial services industry in recent years. The CFPB has issued several rules, interpretive statements and guidance documents that could impact our business practices including, but not limited to, a September 2023 circular on compliance obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) for companies that rely on complex algorithms when making credit decisions, a June 2023 rule requiring registration of nonbank entities that receive a final order or judgment, and a circular that criticized the use of boilerplate language in consumer agreements where such language would be unlawful if enforced against the particular consumer agreeing to the contract. It has also issued several supervisory highlights focusing on various aspects of consumer lending, such as credit reporting, servicing and repossession activities in the auto lending space. The CFPB previously issued an interpretive rule expanding states’ authority to enforce requirements of federal consumer financial laws. In October 2024 the CFPB finalized its Opening Banking Rule to provide consumers greater rights over their personal financial data. In December 2024, the CFPB proposed a rule that makes significant revisions to Regulation V, which implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and imposes new obligations and limitations on entities that collect, sell or share consumer information with third parties. However, in January 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration issued an executive order to halt all activity on the CFPB’s pending and proposed rules, including the proposed changes to Regulation V. Due to the changing nature of the regulatory environment and uncertainty about the priorities and direction of the CFPB under the new U.S. presidential administration, we cannot be certain how the regulatory environment may impact our business.\nState regulators have also increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on financial technology companies and the bank partnership model. Massachusetts recently used its unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) law to find that a fintech company that partnered with a federally insured, state-chartered bank to offer loans in the state was the “true lender” of the loans, and required the fintech company to permanently cease all business in Massachusetts. A recent alert from the Ohio banking regulator announced a change in the regulator’s opinion that the small loan license is now required for fintech companies to broker loans to their bank partners. Increased scrutiny of bank partnership arrangements continues, as states codify laws to determine who is the true lender for certain loans with the goal of regulating either the non-bank partner or limiting the rate that can be charged and/or collected. Moreover, the OCC, FDIC, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued joint guidance indicating they intend to use their supervisory authority through examinations to review bank third-party relationships with financial technology companies to identify business practices that could pose a risk of potential consumer harm. Should the agencies review our program and identify any such risks or issue consent \norders against any of our lending partners, it could impact the viability of the bank partnership model or require additional actions by us and the lending partner to mitigate risks identified. \nWhile we have been proactively working with the federal government and state regulatory bodies to ensure that our AI lending marketplace and other services are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we can provide no assurance that we will not be subject to any regulatory actions. For example, the CFPB issued Upstart the no-action letters, which provided that the CFPB, after a detailed review of Upstart’s fair lending program, did not recommend any supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for a violation of the ECOA. However, in June 2022, at our request, the no-action letter was terminated so that we can keep our models accurate and updated during a period of significant economic change. As a result, we can provide no assurance that the CFPB or any other federal or state regulator will not take supervisory or enforcement action against us in the future. \nWe have been subject to governmental inquiries as well. See the risk factor titled “—We have been in the past and may in the future be subject to federal and state regulatory inquiries regarding our business” for more information. Any government investigations or inquiries, whether or not accurate or warranted, or whether concerning us or one of our competitors, could negatively affect our brand and reputation and the overall market acceptance of and trust in our AI lending marketplace. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage the risks related to our loan servicing and collections obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our loan servicing and collection efforts. In the year ended December 31, 2024, 21% of our revenue from fees, net was generated from loan servicing fees. The vast majority of Upstart-powered loans are not secured by any collateral, and none are guaranteed or insured by any third party or backed by any governmental authority. As a result, we are limited in our ability to collect on such loans on behalf of our lending partners and institutional investors if a borrower is unwilling or unable to repay them. Where the loan is secured by an automobile, for our auto product, or home, for our HELOC product, we could still be limited in our ability to collect on the loan if we cannot secure the automobile or home. The ability to collect on the loans is largely dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and consequently, collections can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, unemployment, divorce, death, illness, bankruptcy or the economic or social factors beyond personal circumstances of a borrower. In addition, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. It is possible that a higher percentage of consumers will seek protection under bankruptcy or debtor relief laws as a result of the current inflationary environment, the possibility of a recession and market volatility. Federal, state, or other restrictions could impair our ability to collect amounts owed and due on the loans facilitated through our marketplace, reduce income received from the loans facilitated through our marketplace, or negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe began conducting first-party collection activities for our lending partners in the fourth quarter of 2022 for loans facilitated through our marketplace. We do not have extensive experience conducting first-party or in-house collection activities, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively manage risks associated with such activities. In addition to first-party collection activities, we partner with third-parties, including collection agencies, to collect on loans we service for our lending partners. In late 2024, we partnered with a third party to begin, for the first time, pursuing litigation as a strategy to collect from certain delinquent borrowers who demonstrate an ability but not a willingness to repay. If Upstart or the third-parties with whom we work on collections do not perform as expected or if we or these third parties act unprofessionally or otherwise cause harm to borrowers of Upstart-powered loans, our brand and reputation could be harmed and our ability to attract potential borrowers to our marketplace could be negatively impacted. For example, during periods of increased delinquencies caused by economic downturns or otherwise, it is important that we and collection agencies we use are proactive and consistent in contacting a borrower to bring a delinquent balance current and ultimately avoid the loan becoming charged off. If we or the third parties we work with are unable to maintain a high quality of service, or fulfill the servicing and collection obligations due to resource constraints, it could result in increased delinquencies and charge-offs on the loans, which could decrease fees payable to us, cause our lending partners to decrease their \ndemand for Upstart-powered loans, erode trust in our lending marketplace or increase the costs of loan funding for our marketplace. If we fail to successfully address any of the foregoing risks associated with our collection activities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are the loan servicer for most loans facilitated through our marketplace, including the loans that are sold as part of whole loan sales, contributed to asset-backed securitizations and pass-through certificate transactions, and pledged in connection with warehouse credit facilities. Loan servicing is a highly manual process and an intensely regulated activity. Errors in our servicing activities, including payment collection and charge-off processes, or failures to comply with our servicing obligations, have in the past and could in the future affect our internal and external reporting of the loans that we service, adversely affect our business and reputation and expose us to liability to borrowers, lending partners or institutional investors. In addition, we charge our loan holders a fixed percentage servicing fee based on the outstanding balance of loans serviced. If we fail to efficiently service or collect on such loans and the costs incurred exceed the servicing fee charged, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, the laws and regulations governing these activities, including licensing obligations and requirements, are subject to change. For institutional investors that are statutory trusts, there is now additional risk based on a court decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where the CFPB recently obtained a favorable decision that it has enforcement authority over these trusts when the trusts engage in providing financial products or services, such as using third parties to collect on delinquent debts. Overall, if we are unable to comply with such laws and regulations governing servicing activities, we could lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, become subject to greater scrutiny by regulatory agencies or become subject to sanctions or litigation, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to perform our servicing obligations or make our marketplace available to borrowers in particular states. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile auto loans issued through our lending marketplace or retail installment contracts we purchase from automobile dealerships are secured by collateral, auto loans are inherently risky, as they are secured by assets that may be difficult to locate and can depreciate rapidly. We generally begin the repossession process for auto loans that become 60 days past due. We have engaged a third-party auto repossession vendor to handle all repossession activity. Following a repossession, if a borrower fails to redeem their vehicle or reinstate their loan agreement, whichever is required by law, the repossessed vehicle is sold at an auction and the proceeds are applied to the unpaid balance of the loan and related expenses. If the proceeds do not cover the unpaid balance of the loan and any related expenses permitted to be charged, and we are unable to recover the deficiency balance from the borrower, where permitted, the deficiency would be charged-off. Further, if a vehicle cannot be located, repossession and sale of the vehicle would not be possible and the outstanding loan balance may not be recovered. A significant number of delinquencies and charge-offs could decrease fees collectable by us, cause our lending partners to reduce loan originations, erode trust in our lending marketplace and lead to an increase in the costs of loan funding for our marketplace.\nAdditionally, if such repossession vendors do not perform consistent with agreements entered into with us, or if vendors act unprofessionally or otherwise cause harm to borrowers of Upstart-powered loans, our brand and reputation could be harmed and our ability to attract potential borrowers to our marketplace could be negatively impacted. We may also become subject to regulatory scrutiny and potential litigation based on the conduct of our repossession vendors.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from a single loan product, and we are thus particularly susceptible to fluctuations in the unsecured personal loan market. \nThe vast majority of loan originations currently facilitated through our marketplace are unsecured personal loans. While the market for unsecured personal loans has grown rapidly in recent years, it is unclear to what extent such market will continue to grow, if at all. A wide variety of factors could impact the market for unsecured personal loans, including macroeconomic conditions, competition, regulatory developments and other developments in the credit market. Our success will depend in part on the continued growth of the unsecured personal loan market, and if such market does not grow or grows more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n In order to preserve and expand our relationships with lending partners and institutional investors, it may become important for us to be able to offer a wider variety of products than we currently provide. We are also susceptible to competitors that may intentionally underprice their loan products, even if such pricing practices lead to losses. Such practices by competitors would negatively affect the overall demand for loans facilitated through our marketplace.\nFurther, because personal loans are unsecured, there is a risk that borrowers will not prioritize repayment of such loans, particularly in any economic down-cycle. To the extent borrowers have or incur other indebtedness that is secured, such as a mortgage, a home equity line of credit or an auto loan, borrowers may choose to repay those obligations before repaying their unsecured Upstart-powered personal loans. In addition, borrowers may not view Upstart-powered loans, originated through an online lending marketplace, as having the same significance as other credit obligations arising under more traditional circumstances, such as loans directly from banks or other commercial financial institutions. Any of the foregoing could lead to higher default rates and decreased demand by our lending partners and institutional investors to fund loans facilitated through our marketplace, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also more susceptible to the risks of changing and increased regulations and other legal and regulatory actions targeted towards the unsecured personal loan market. If we are unable to manage the risks associated with the unsecured personal loan product, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe sales and onboarding process of new lending partners could take longer than expected, leading to fluctuations or variability in expected revenues and results of operations.\nOur sales and onboarding process with new lending partners can be long, vary widely and generally takes approximately two to twelve months. As a result, revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. Prospective lending partners are often cautious in making decisions to implement our platform and related services because of the risk management alignment and regulatory uncertainties related to their use of our AI models, including their oversight, model governance and fair lending compliance obligations associated with using such models. In addition, prospective lending partners undertake an extensive diligence review of our platform, compliance and servicing activities before choosing to partner with us. Further, the implementation of our AI models often involve shifts by the lending partner to a new software platform or changes in their operational procedures, which may involve significant time and expense to implement. Delays in onboarding new lending partners can also arise while prospective lending partners complete their internal procedures to approve expenditures and test and accept our applications. Consequently, we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which new lending partners will begin using our platform and the volume of fees we will receive, which can lead to fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are continuing to introduce and develop new loan products and services offerings, and if these products are not successful or we are unable to manage the related risks, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have introduced auto loan, small dollar loan, and home equity lines of credit products and are continuing to invest in developing these products and other new loan products and service offerings. New initiatives are inherently risky, as each involves unproven business strategies, new regulatory requirements and new financial products and services with which we, and in some cases our lending partners, have limited or no prior development or operating experience.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to develop, commercially market and achieve market acceptance of any new products and services. In addition, our investment of resources to develop new products and services may either be insufficient or result in expenses that are excessive in light of revenue actually derived from these new products and services. It is also possible that such investment of resources may need to be delayed or deferred, as was the case with respect to the small business loan product when we decided to suspend its development in January \n2023 due to the adverse macroeconomic conditions affecting our business at that time. We may also have difficulty with securing adequate loan funding, either from lending partners or from institutional investors, for new loan products and services, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop and grow these new offerings and services will be impaired. If the profile of borrowers using any new products and services is different from that of those currently served by the existing loan products offered through our marketplace, our AI models may not be able to accurately evaluate the credit risk of such borrowers, and we may not be able to obtain loan funding for new products and services on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, it is possible that a new product in its development stage has a higher level of delinquencies or defaults than a more established product as our AI models calibrate to a potentially different set of data. Failure to accurately predict demand or growth with respect to our new products and services could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business, and there is always risk that new products and services will be unprofitable, will increase our costs, decrease operating margins or take longer than anticipated to achieve target margins. In addition, any new products or services may raise new and potentially complex regulatory compliance obligations, which would increase our costs and may cause us to change our business in unexpected ways. Further, our development efforts with respect to these initiatives could distract management from current operations and will divert capital and other resources from our existing business. If we are unable to effectively manage the foregoing risks, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees, former employees, vendors, or service providers could harm our reputation and subject us to significant legal liability.\nWe operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our borrowers and lending partners is of critical importance. Our business depends on our employees, vendors, and service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, including transactions that involve significant dollar amounts and loan transactions that involve the use and disclosure of sensitive personal and business information. We are thus exposed to the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees, vendors, and other service providers that could adversely affect our business, including employees, vendors, or service providers taking, converting, or misusing funds, documents, or data, or failing to follow applicable laws and regulations or our internal policies or protocol when interacting with consumers and borrowers. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct or errors by employees, vendors, or service providers, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. There have been numerous highly-publicized cases of fraud and other misconduct by financial services industry employees. We have experienced employee misconduct and may continue to do so in the future. Depending on the severity, any illegal, improper, or suspicious activity or other misconduct by our employees, vendors or service providers could result in serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, relationships with lending partners and borrowers, and our ability to attract new lending partners or borrowers. We could also be subject to civil or criminal liability as a result of actions by our employees, vendors or service providers. Any of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, inability to attract future borrowers or lending partners, reputational damage, regulatory intervention, and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.\nIf we do not compete effectively in our target markets, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe consumer lending market is highly competitive and increasingly dynamic as emerging technologies continue to enter the marketplace. With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants, competition may persist and intensify in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our operations or business.\nOur inability to compete effectively could result in reduced loan volumes, reduced average size of loans facilitated on our marketplace, reduced fees, increased marketing and borrower acquisition costs or the failure of the Upstart marketplace to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nConsumer lending is a vast and competitive market, and we compete to varying degrees with all other sources of consumer credit. This can include banks, non-bank lenders, retail-based lenders and other financial technology lending platforms. Because personal loans often serve as a replacement for credit cards, we also compete with the convenience and ubiquity that credit cards and buy now, pay later products represent. Many of our competitors operate with different business models, such as lending-as-a-service, have different funding sources, have different cost structures or regulatory obligations, or participate selectively in different market segments. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, economic, technological and other developments, including utilizing new data sources or credit models. We may also face competition from banks or companies that have not previously competed in the consumer lending market, including companies with access to vast amounts of consumer-related information that could be used in the development of their own credit risk models. Our current or potential competitors may be better at developing new products due to their large and experienced data science and engineering teams, who are able to respond more quickly to new technologies. Many of our current or potential competitors have significantly more resources, such as financial, technical and marketing resources, than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their platforms and distribution channels. \nWe face competition in a variety of areas. Our competitors may have longer operating histories, lower commercial financing costs or costs of capital, more extensive borrower bases, more diversified products and borrower bases, operational efficiencies, a better user experience, more versatile or extensive technology platforms, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty, broader borrower and partner relationships, more extensive and/or a more diversified loan funding institutional investor bases, greater capacity to fund loans through their balance sheets, and more extensive product and service offerings . Furthermore, our existing and potential competitors may decide to modify their pricing and business models to compete more directly with us. Our ability to compete will also be affected by our ability to provide our lending partners with a commensurate or more extensive suite of loan products than those offered by our competitors. In addition, current or potential competitors, including financial technology lending platforms and existing or potential lending partners, may also acquire or form strategic alliances with one another, which could result in our competitors being able to offer more competitive loan terms due to their access to lower-cost capital. Such acquisitions or strategic alliances among our competitors or potential competitors could also make our competitors more adaptable to a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. To stay competitive, we may need to increase our regulatory compliance expenditures or our ability to compete may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is driven by constant innovation. We utilize AI and machine learning, which is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments, our ability to operate profitably could suffer. There can be no assurance that research, data accumulation and development by other companies will not result in AI models that are superior to our AI models or result in products superior to those we develop or that any technologies, products or services we develop will be preferred to any existing or newly-developed technologies, products or services. If we are unable to compete with such companies or fail to meet the need for innovation in our industry, the use of our technology could stagnate or substantially decline, or our AI lending marketplace could fail to maintain or achieve more widespread market acceptance, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit, and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in U.S. consumer credit. As a result, we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to U.S. consumer credit than a more diversified company. For example, our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the U.S. economy and consumer spending and consumer credit, such as rising interest rates and changes in monetary policy. We are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit. Our business concentration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.\nIf we are unable to manage the risks associated with fraudulent activity, our brand and reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFraud is prevalent in the financial services industry and is likely to increase as perpetrators become more sophisticated. High profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation. We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with borrowers and third parties handling borrower information and, in limited situations, we cover certain fraud losses of our lending partners and institutional investors. For example, in the third quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, we experienced temporary increases in fraudulent activity. Fraud rates could also increase in a down-cycle economy. We have experienced employee misconduct in the past and continue to be subject to risk of fraudulent activity associated with our own employees. We use several identity and fraud detection tools, including tools provided by third-party vendors and our proprietary AI models, to predict and otherwise validate or authenticate applicant-reported data and data derived from third-party sources. If such efforts are insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud, the level of fraud-related losses of Upstart-powered loans could increase, which would decrease confidence in our AI lending marketplace and have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results. It is also possible that fraud perpetrators target our marketplace because of the high degree of automation in our credit decision process where borrowers can be approved instantly. In addition, our lending partners, institutional investors or we may not be able to recover amounts disbursed on loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, which could erode the trust in our brand and negatively impact our ability to attract new lending partners and institutional investors to our marketplace.\n In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our brand and reputation. Further, if there is any increase in fraudulent activity that increases the need for human intervention in screening loan application data, the level of automation on our platform could decline and negatively affect our unit economics. If we are unable to manage these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain and motivate our personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success significantly depends on the continued service of our senior management team and other highly skilled personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization.\nCompetition is high for skilled personnel, including engineering and data analytics personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located. While we have transitioned to a Digital First work model which allows us to recruit nationwide, we have experienced, and expect to continue to face, some difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel, especially as we pursue our growth strategy. We may not be able to hire or retain such personnel at compensation or flexibility levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure and policies. We periodically review our compensation levels to ensure they remain competitive and have increased them when we believe market conditions warrant it. However, we may need to further increase our existing compensation levels in response to competition, rising inflation or labor shortages, which would increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In particular, candidates making employment decisions, specifically in high-technology industries, often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. The recent significant volatility in the price of our stock may have adversely contributed to, and in the future may affect, our ability to attract or retain highly skilled technical, financial and marketing personnel.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements. While we are in the process of training their replacements, the quality of our services and our ability to serve our lending partners, institutional investors and borrowers whose loans we service may suffer, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we have reduced our workforce in the past and may further reduce our workforce in the future to lower our operating costs and streamline operations. These reductions in our workforce may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain personnel who are critical to our business. It may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in our workforce, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage the fluctuations in our business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth in the past placed significant demands on our management, processes and operational, technological and financial resources. Economic headwinds in recent years led to us announcing reductions in our workforce which were intended to help us achieve a more cost-efficient organization. These fluctuations in the momentum of our business challenge our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees and technologies into our existing business. Our success as a business continues to require us to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees and invest strategically to refine our operational, technological and financial infrastructure. See also the risk factor titled “—We depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain and motivate our personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.” As part of that effort and from time to time, we rely on temporary independent contractor programs to scale our operations team. Failure to effectively implement and manage such programs could result in misclassification or other employment related claims or inquiries by governmental agencies. Continued fluctuations in the momentum of our business will strain our ability to develop and improve our operational policies and procedures, AI models and technology, disclosure controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting, management oversight, loan funding and relationships with borrowers, lending partners and institutional investors. For example, there are certain aspects of our information technology and our operations, such as servicing activities, that have required, and still require, manual processes which are prone to errors and that we have not yet fully automated with new technologies. Some of the foregoing factors, like the manual processes, have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nSecurity breaches, improper access to our or borrowers’ data, or other security incidents may harm our reputation, adversely affect our results of operations and expose us to liability.\nWe are increasingly dependent on data, information systems, services and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, transmit and store large amounts of sensitive information, including personal information, credit information and other sensitive data of borrowers and potential borrowers. It is critical that we do so in a manner designed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such sensitive information. We also have arrangements in place with certain of our third-party vendors that require us to share consumer information in order for the vendor to provide its services. We have outsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may have access to our computer networks and sensitive or confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties may in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to other parties. As a result, our information technology systems, including the functions of third parties that are involved or have access to those systems, are large and complex, with many points of entry and access. \nWhile all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the size, complexity, accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems that house sensitive information make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious, internal and external attacks. Any vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, lending partners, institutional investors, or by malicious threat actors. While we continuously mature our security controls to address the evolving threat landscape, such measures will not provide absolute security, and remediation efforts may not be successful. Cybersecurity attacks in the financial services industry are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” nation states and others. These risks may be heightened in connection with geopolitical conflicts. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, cyber attacks could result in compromising the integrity or availability of our information systems, products and services or infrastructure to operate our business and the confidentiality of our and borrowers’ data. Such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means. The prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents. Further, our Digital First working environment could increase the risks of security breaches and incidents as more of our employees are accessing our services and infrastructure remotely, reducing physical and social security controls on employee monitoring. \nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the borrowers, lending partners, institutional investors, vendors and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely on to facilitate or enable our business activities. Security breaches and attacks on our information systems and infrastructure or those of our business partners may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience of our products and services, cause our customers, borrowers or business partners to lose confidence and trust in us, or harm our transaction volume, revenue or future growth prospects. Significant disruptions to information technology systems or other security incidents within our company, our lending partners and dealerships, or third parties that we or they do business with could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss, misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive consumer or employee information, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. When security breaches, incidents or attacks impact information systems of third parties, we may not always have control over security measures or responses to such events. For example, a mid-2024 cyber attack on CDK Global, a third-party vendor that provides customer relationship management and deal management services solutions to dealerships, temporarily disrupted dealership operations nationwide. While we promptly implemented workaround solutions to support our dealer partners and thus the business impact to our company was minimal, the dealers were impacted in their ability to make sales and provide auto loans. Our use of AI technology may create additional cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks, including risks of security breaches and incidents. Further, AI technology may be used in connection with certain types of cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security breaches and incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we, our business partners or any third parties that we rely on to operate our business may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal information. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity following a breach, which may cause borrowers and potential borrowers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures for our products and enterprise. Any security breach or incident, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and ability to attract new borrowers to our marketplace.\nLike other financial and technology services firms, we have been and continue to be the subject of actual or attempted unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse of information, computer viruses or malware, and cyber-attacks that could obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, distributed denial of service attacks, data breaches and other infiltration, exfiltration or other similar events. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information or other \nsensitive information that we or our vendors maintain, including our own proprietary business information and sensitive information such as personal information regarding borrowers or any security compromises in our industry or industries that we rely on to conduct our business, whether actual or perceived, or information technology system disruptions could interrupt our business or operations, harm our reputation, erode borrower confidence, negatively affect our ability to attract new borrowers, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nSecurity incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. There can be no assurance that our security measures intended to protect our services and infrastructure will successfully prevent service interruptions or security incidents. We cannot provide any assurance that security vulnerabilities will not arise in the future as we continue to expand the features and functionalities of our platform and introduce new loan products on our platform, and we expect to continue investing substantially to protect against security vulnerabilities and incidents.\nWe maintain errors, omissions, and cyber liability insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages. However, we cannot be certain that our coverage will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim, or that any insurer will be adequately covered by reinsurance or other risk mitigants or that any insurer will offer to renew policies at an affordable rate or offer such coverage at all in the future. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur proprietary AI models rely in part on the use of loan applicant and borrower data and other third-party data, and if we lose the ability to use such data, or if such data contain inaccuracies, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our proprietary AI models, which are statistical models built using a variety of data-sets. Our AI models rely on a wide variety of data sources, including data collected from applicants and borrowers, credit bureau data, and our credit experience gained through monitoring the payment performance of borrowers over time. The CFPB recently issued a final rule on “open banking” and protection of personal financial data rights that would give consumers certain rights in deciding how financial institutions and companies like us can use and transfer consumer personal financial data, and also includes additional restrictions and requirements on companies that use such data. The CFPB also issued a proposed rule on Regulation V, which implements the FCRA, which, if not withdrawn, could limit our use of data. If we are unable to access and use data collected from applicants and borrowers, data received from credit bureaus, repayment data collected as part of our loan servicing activities, or any other data for our AI models, or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate potential borrowers, detect fraud and verify applicant data would be compromised. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact the accuracy of our pricing, the degree of automation in our loan application process and the volume of loans facilitated on our marketplace. In addition, if we were required to share unique data we collect from applicants and borrowers with third parties, that could lessen Upstart’s competitive advantage.\nThird-party data sources on which we rely include the consumer reporting agencies regulated by the CFPB and other alternative data sources. Such data is electronically obtained from third parties and used, for example, in our AI models to price applicants and in our fraud models to verify the accuracy of applicant-reported information. Data from national credit bureaus and other consumer reporting agencies, as well as other information that we receive from third parties about an applicant or borrower, may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the applicant or borrower’s creditworthiness for a variety of reasons, including inaccurate reporting by creditors to the credit bureaus, errors, staleness or incompleteness. Loan applicants’ credit scores may not reflect such applicants’ actual creditworthiness because the credit scores or data underlying those credit scores may be outdated, incomplete or inaccurate. Although regulatory protections, such as ECOA and the FCRA, are in place to afford consumers the right to dispute inaccuracies and despite the fact that we use numerous third-party data sources and multiple credit \nfactors within our proprietary models, which helps mitigate this risk, it does not eliminate the risk of an inaccurate individual report.\nFurther, although we attempt to verify the income, employment and education information provided by applicants, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of applicant information. Our fraud models rely in part on data we receive from a number of third-party verification vendors, data collected from applicants, and our experience gained through monitoring the performance of borrowers over time. Information provided by applicants may be incomplete, inaccurate or intentionally false. Applicants may also misrepresent their intentions for the use of loan proceeds. We do not verify or confirm any statements by applicants as to how loan proceeds are to be used after loan funding, although borrowers agree that they will use the funds for household or personal use. If an applicant supplied false, misleading or inaccurate information and our fraud detection processes do not flag the application, repayments on the corresponding loan may be lower, in some cases significantly lower, than expected, leading to losses for the lending partner or institutional investor.\nIn addition, if any data used to train and improve our AI models is inaccurate or otherwise unreliable, or access to third-party data is limited or becomes unavailable to us, our ability to continue to improve our AI models would be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing could result in sub-optimally and inefficiently priced loans, incorrect approvals or denials of loans, or higher than expected loan losses, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to attract new borrowers, lending partners and institutional investors to our marketplace or increase the number of Upstart-powered loans and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with asset-backed securitizations, pass-through certificate transactions, warehouse credit facilities and whole loan sales, we make representations and warranties concerning the loans transferred, and if such representations and warranties are not accurate when made, we could be required to repurchase the applicable loans.\nIn our asset-backed securitizations, pass-through certificate transactions, warehouse credit facilities, whole loan sale arrangements and other commercial transactions, we make numerous representations and warranties concerning the characteristics of the Upstart-powered loans sold and transferred in connection with such transactions, including representations and warranties that the loans meet the eligibility requirements of those facilities and of institutional investors. If those representations and warranties were not accurate when made and are not timely cured or incurable, we may be required to repurchase the underlying loans. Failure to repurchase such loans could constitute a default or termination event under the agreements governing our various arrangements or transactions and could require us to indemnify certain financing parties. Through December 31, 2024, the number of repurchased Upstart-powered loans as a result of inaccurate representations and warranties represents less than 1% of all Upstart-powered loans. While only a small number of Upstart-powered loans have been historically repurchased by us, there can be no assurance that we would have adequate cash or other qualifying assets available to make such repurchases if and when required. Such repurchases could be limited in scope, relating to small pools of loans, or significant in scope, across multiple pools of loans. If we were required to make such repurchases and if we do not have adequate liquidity to fund such repurchases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, a high volume of repurchases due to a breach of such representations and warranties could have an adverse impact on our reputation as a loan seller and servicer.\nBorrowers may prepay a loan at any time without penalty, which could reduce our servicing fees and deter our lending partners and institutional investors from investing in loans facilitated through our lending marketplace.\nA borrower may decide to prepay all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount on a loan at any time without penalty. If the entire outstanding unpaid principal amount of a loan is prepaid, we would not receive a servicing fee, or we would receive significantly less servicing fees for such prepaid loan. Our AI models are designed to predict prepayment rates, but prepayment may occur for a variety of reasons. If a significant volume of prepayments occur that our AI models do not accurately predict, the amount of our revenue from servicing fees would decline and returns targeted by our lending partners and institutional investors would be adversely affected, \nwhich would harm our business and results or operations and our ability to attract new lending partners and institutional investors.\nOur marketing efforts and brand promotion activities may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our AI lending marketplace is important to our ability to grow our business, attract new lending partners, increase the number of potential borrowers on our marketplace and attract institutional investors to our marketplace. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in the consumer lending industry expands. For example, because some of our lending partners have adopted our lending partner-branded version of our AI lending marketplace through their own websites, potential borrowers may not be aware they are experiencing our AI lending marketplace, which may hinder recognition of our brand. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of marketing efforts and the overall user experience of our lending partners and potential borrowers on the Upstart marketplace. The marketing channels that we employ may also become more crowded and saturated by other lending platforms, which may decrease the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and increase borrower acquisition costs. Also, the methodologies, policies and regulations applicable to marketing channels may change. For example, the the CFPB has proposed a rule that limits how data brokers can share consumer information and that prohibits secondary use of data, including for targeted marketing. Similarly, internet search engines could revise their methodologies, which could adversely affect borrower volume from organic ranking and paid search. Search engines may also implement policies that restrict the ability of companies such as us to advertise their services and products, which could prevent us from appearing in a favorable location or any location in the organic rankings or paid search results when certain search terms are used by the consumer.\nOur brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues. If we fail to successfully build trust in our AI lending marketplace and the performance and predictability of Upstart-powered loans, we may lose existing lending partners and institutional investors to our competitors or be unable to attract new lending partners and institutional investors, which in turn would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if our marketing efforts result in increased revenue, we may be unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in loan volume, which could result in a higher borrower acquisition cost per account. Any increases due to greater marketing expenditures, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future become, subject to lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties , other claims, examinations, investigations, enforcement actions, legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, all of which may affect our results of operations. These claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could involve, and in some cases have involved, labor and employment, discrimination and harassment, commercial disputes, intellectual property rights (including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other proprietary rights), class actions, general contract, tort, defamation, data privacy rights, antitrust, common law fraud, government regulation, alleged federal and state securities and “blue sky” law violations or other investor claims, and other matters. For example, we are a defendant in a number of securities class action and other related lawsuits. See the “Legal” section under “Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies” and the risk factor titled “—The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment” for more information.\nIn addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our business and the application of certain laws and regulations, participants in our industry are regularly named as defendants in litigation alleging violations of federal and state laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws . The CFPB recently issued a final rule that would require non-bank entities like us to report any public orders related to violations of consumer protection laws in a registry that will be made available to the general public, potentially increasing litigation and regulatory scrutiny. \nSee the risk factor titled “—If loans facilitated through our marketplace for one or more lending partners were subject to successful challenge that the lending partner was not the “true lender,” such loans may be \nunenforceable, subject to rescission or otherwise impaired, we or other program participants may be subject to penalties, and/or our commercial relationships may suffer, each which would adversely affect our business and results of operations” for more information.\nSee also the risk factors titled “—If loans originated by our lending partners were found to violate the laws of one or more states, whether at origination or after sale by the lending partner, loans facilitated through our marketplace may be unenforceable or otherwise impaired, we or other program participants may be subject to, among other things, fines and penalties, and/or our commercial relationships may suffer, each of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations” and “—We have been in the past and may in the future be subject to federal and state regulatory inquiries regarding our business” for more information. \nIf we were subject to such litigation or enforcement, then any unfavorable results of pending or future legal proceedings may result in contractual damages, usury related claims, fines, penalties, injunctions, the unenforceability, rescission or other impairment of loans originated through our marketplace or other censure that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe long-term impact of operating with a Digital First workforce on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.\nSince our announcement of a Digital First work model in June 2021, remote work with less time in the office has been the primary experience for most of our employees. Our workforce is currently distributed across the U.S., and we expect this to continue. Although we anticipate that this Digital First model will have a long-term positive impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, there is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business from this model, including cost savings, operational efficiencies, or productivity.\nOur Digital First model could lead to a negative long-term impact on our operations, the execution of our business plans and sales and marketing efforts, our company culture, or the productivity and retention of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our past business practices. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event were to occur that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in increased exposure to consumer privacy and data security incidents, or fraudulent activity. Furthermore, our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements related to a remote workforce may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. If we are unable to successfully address the foregoing risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may evaluate and potentially consummate acquisitions or investments in complementary business and technologies, which could require significant management attention, consume our financial resources, disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of, or investments in, complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. For example, in 2021, we completed the acquisition of Prodigy, a provider of automotive retail software. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. In the future, we may acquire assets or businesses. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n•utilization of our financial resources for acquisitions or investments that may fail to realize the anticipated benefits;\n•inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n•coordination of technology, product development and sales and marketing functions and integration of administrative systems;\n•transition of the acquired company’s borrowers to our systems;\n•retention of employees from the acquired company;\n•regulatory risks, including maintaining good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business;\n•attracting financing;\n•cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies;\n•potential write-offs of loans or intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period;\n•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n•assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property or increase our risk for liability; and\n•litigation, claims or other liabilities in connection with the acquired company.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, or cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition.\nStrategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake and that we do not control may from time to time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals. As a result, business decisions or other actions or omissions of controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, or otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\nOur business is subject to the risks of natural disasters and other catastrophic events, many of which are becoming more acute and frequent due to climate change, and to interruption by human-induced problems.\nSignificant natural disasters or other catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, blizzards, or floods (many of which are becoming more acute and frequent as a result of climate change), or interruptions by strikes, crime, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, internal or external system failures, telecommunications failures, a failure of banking or other financial institutions, power outages or increased risk of cybersecurity breaches due to a swift transition to remote work brought about by a catastrophic event, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular are unclear; however, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Either of our headquarters may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Our headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region that is prone to seismic activity and has experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events and at an increasing rate. Examples include but are not limited to drought and water scarcity, warmer temperatures, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shut-offs associated with wildfire prevention. The increasing intensity of drought throughout California and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages. Our office in Columbus, Ohio is a region at higher risk for extreme winter weather, including blizzards. Although we maintain a disaster response plan and insurance, such events could disrupt our business, the business of our lending partners or third-party suppliers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain and resume operations. We may not maintain sufficient business interruption or property insurance to compensate us for potentially significant losses, including potential harm to our business that may result from interruptions in our ability to provide our financial products and services.\nIn addition, acts of war and other armed conflicts, disruptions in global trade, travel restrictions and quarantines, terrorism and other civil, political and geopolitical conflicts, could cause disruptions in our business and lead to interruptions, delays or loss of critical data. Any of the foregoing risks may be further increased if our business continuity plans prove to be inadequate and there can be no assurance that both personnel and non-mission critical applications can be fully operational after a declared disaster within a defined recovery time. If our personnel, systems or data centers are impacted, we may suffer interruptions and delays in our business operations. In addition, to the extent these events impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other data points that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and assumptions which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our financial results include: (i) fair value determinations; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) consolidation of VIEs; and (iv) the evaluation for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. The judgments and assumptions used in accounting conclusions related to committed capital and other co-investment arrangements are especially complex. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, or changes to existing standards, and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, alter our operational policies and implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or we may be required to restate our published financial statements. Such changes to existing standards or changes in their interpretation may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and profit and loss, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit and loss target, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs, and significant management oversight. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.\nWeaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting have been discovered in the past and may be discovered in the future. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to identify or prevent future material weaknesses or deficiencies. The nature of our business is such that our financial statements involve a number of complex accounting policies, many of which involve significant elements of judgment, including determinations regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities, determinations regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities (including loans, line of credit receivable, notes receivable, payable to securitization note holders and residual certificate holders, servicing assets and liabilities, and trailing fee liabilities) and the appropriate classification of various items within our financial statements. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our significant accounting policies. The inherent complexity of these accounting matters and the nature and variety of transactions in which we are involved require that we have sufficient qualified accounting personnel with an appropriate level of experience and controls in our financial reporting process commensurate with the complexity of our business. While we believe we have sufficient internal accounting personnel and external resources and appropriate controls to address the demands of our business, we expect that the growth and development of our business will place significant additional demands on our accounting resources. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As a public company, we are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that we will maintain internal control over financial reporting sufficient to enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nSome of our estimates, including our key metrics in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nCertain estimates and forecasts included in this report, including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this report relating to the size and expected growth of our target market may prove to be inaccurate. It is impossible to offer every loan product, term or feature that every customer wants or that any given lending partner is necessarily capable of supporting, and our competitors may develop and offer loan products, terms or features that we do not offer. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted in this report, we may be unable to address these markets successfully and our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons outside of our control, including competition in our industry. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our key metrics to improve their accuracy. For example, in the third quarter of 2021, we adjusted our process for calculating Conversion Rate to account for an increase in fraudulent applications. Our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. If investors or analysts do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe maintain cash deposits in excess of federally insured limits. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank failures, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe regularly maintain domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured banks that exceed the FDIC insurance limits. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may lead to liquidity constraints. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed and was taken into receivership by the FDIC. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. treasury, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT\nIt may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur ability to operate our platform depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate our AI models or AI lending marketplace and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark laws and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and our information security infrastructure to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. While we have, as of December 31, 2024, four patents granted and four patent applications pending in the United States related to our proprietary risk model and data engineering, we have limited patent protection and our patent applications may not be successful. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nOur proprietary technology, including our AI models, may actually or may be alleged to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. If we are unsuccessful, such claims or litigation could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, or we could in some circumstances be required to make changes to our business to avoid such infringement, which would negatively impact our financial performance. We may also be obligated to indemnify parties, cease using the technology or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nMoreover, it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as ours. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending against such claims is time-consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. In addition, although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs, such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. In other cases, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nFurthermore, our technology may become obsolete or inadequate, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop, obtain or use new technologies to adapt our models and systems to compete with other technologies as they develop. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, or if our technology becomes obsolete or inadequate, our ability to maintain our model and systems, facilitate loans or perform our servicing obligations on the loans could be adversely affected.\nAny significant disruption in our AI lending platform could prevent us from processing loan applicants and servicing loans, reduce the effectiveness of our AI models and result in a loss of lending partners, institutional investors, applicants or borrowers.\nIn the event of a system outage or other event resulting in data loss or corruption, our ability to process loan applications, service loans or otherwise facilitate loans through our marketplace would be adversely affected. We also rely on facilities, components, and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities, cloud storage services and national consumer reporting agencies to process loan applications, service loans and otherwise facilitate loans through our marketplace. We host our AI lending platform using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a \nlapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to AWS data centers, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in the event we must secure alternative cloud infrastructure services. For a large portion of borrowers’ data used in our AI lending marketplace, we obtain borrowers’ data from national consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, and rely on their services in order to process loan applications for our lending partners. Any interference or disruption of our technology and underlying infrastructure or our use of third-party services could adversely affect our relationships with our lending partners and institutional investors, and the overall user experience of our marketplace. Depending on the type and severity of any such disruption, we could be exposed to litigation and regulatory risk. For example, a cybersecurity incident could result in the exposure of consumer data triggering remedial measures, notification requirements, as well as litigation and regulatory exposure. Also, as our business grows, we may be required to expand and improve the capacity, capability and reliability of our infrastructure. If we are not able to effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and infrastructure to reliably support our business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage or other event resulting in data loss or corruption. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees’ attention, subject us to liability and cause borrowers to abandon our business, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if our software contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage high volumes of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in failure to accurately predict a loan applicant’s creditworthiness, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, approval of sub-optimally priced loans, incorrectly displayed interest rates to applicants or borrowers, or incorrectly charged interest to borrowers or fees to lending partners or institutional investors, failure to present or properly display regulatory disclosures to applicants for an extended period of time, failure to detect fraudulent activity on our platform, a negative experience for consumers or lending partners, delayed introductions of new features or enhancements, or failure to protect borrower data or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, loss of consumers or lending partners, increased regulatory scrutiny, fines or penalties, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, updates made to our software to remediate any errors discovered may prove to be ineffective, resulting in repeated issues and further harm to our business. \nSome aspects of our business processes include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nWe incorporate open source software into processes supporting our business. Such open source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of our systems and negatively affects our business operations.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make source code available at no cost for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use.\nWe may face claims from third parties demanding the release or license of, such modifications or derivative works (which could include our proprietary source code or AI models) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. If portions of our proprietary AI models are determined to be subject to an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our model or change our business activities, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and potentially our intellectual property rights. If we were required to publicly disclose any portion of our proprietary models, it is possible we could lose the benefit of trade secret protection for our models.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open source software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business.\nThe use of generative AI technologies by our employees or contractors could expose us to unexpected liability.\nOur employees and contractors use generative AI technologies in connection with their performance of services and, as with many developing technologies, generative AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. While we have policies and processes in place to protect against it, we face the risk of security threats from employee or contractor errors (such as unauthorized use of third party generative AI technologies in job functions, our products, or in the operation of our business) or malfeasance in connection with generative AI technologies. Even authorized use of generative AI technologies by our employees or contractors may generate content, including software code, that appears facially correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed or contains security vulnerabilities. Our customers, employees, or others may rely on or use such factually incorrect or flawed content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. Further, security vulnerabilities introduced by generative AI technologies into our software could expose us to cybersecurity risks. Questions surrounding license rights and liability for infringement in AI technology generally, and generative AI technology specifically, have not been fully addressed by competent legal tribunals or applicable laws or regulations. The use or adoption of third-party AI technology, including generative AI technology, into our products and services and our internal business operations may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement, other intellectual property-related causes of action, or other potential reputational harms.\nWhile we have policies governing our personnel’s use of third party generative AI technologies, we cannot guarantee that the policies will be adhered to by all of our employees and contractors and we cannot guarantee that the policies will protect us from all potential liability relating to our adoption of generative AI technologies.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe rely on strategic relationships with loan aggregators to attract applicants to our marketplace, and if we cannot maintain effective relationships with loan aggregators or successfully replace their services, our business could be adversely affected.\nA significant number of consumers that apply for a loan on Upstart.com learn about and access Upstart.com through the websites of loan aggregators, typically with hyperlinks from such loan aggregators’ websites to landing pages on our website. While we are continuing to expand our direct acquisition channels, we anticipate that we will continue to depend in significant part on relationships with loan aggregators to maintain and grow our business. For example, a significant amount of our loan originations was derived from traffic from Credit Karma, one of the loan aggregators with whom we partner. The loan aggregators, including Credit Karma, are not required to display offers from our lending partners on their websites nor are they prohibited from working with our competitors or adding our competitors to their platforms. If traffic from Credit Karma or other loan aggregators decreases in the future for any reason or if the loan aggregators implement policies that would adversely impact our business, our loan originations and results of operations would be adversely affected. There is also no assurance that Credit Karma or other loan aggregators will continue to partner with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to loan aggregators to favor their products or services or in reducing the volume of loans facilitated through our marketplace. Loan aggregators may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, and we may have disagreements or disputes with them, which could adversely affect our brand and reputation. If we cannot successfully enter into and maintain effective strategic relationships with loan aggregators, our business could be adversely affected.\nSuch loan aggregators also face litigation and regulatory scrutiny for their part in the consumer lending ecosystem, and as a result, their business models may require fundamental change or may not be sustainable in the future. For example, loan aggregators are increasingly required to be licensed as loan brokers or lead generators in many states, subjecting them to increased regulatory supervision and more stringent business requirements. While we require loan aggregators to make certain disclosures in connection with our lending partners’ offers and restrict how loan aggregators may display such loan offers, loan aggregators may nevertheless alter or even remove these required disclosures without notifying us, which may result in liability to us. Further, we do not have control over any content on loan aggregator websites unrelated to our product, and it is possible that our brand and reputation may be adversely affected by being associated with such content. An unsatisfied borrower could also seek to bring claims against us based on the content presented on a loan aggregator’s website. Such claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could distract management’s attention from the operation of the business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our relationships with third-party vendors. In some cases, third-party vendors are one of a limited number of sources. For example, we rely on national consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, for a large portion of the data used in our AI models. In addition, we rely on third-party verification technologies and services that are critical to our ability to maintain a high level of automation on our platform. In addition, because we are not a bank, we cannot belong to or directly access the ACH payment network. As a result, we rely on one or more banks with access to the ACH payment network to process collections on Upstart-powered loans. Many of our vendor agreements are terminable by either party without penalty and with little notice. If any of our third-party vendors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in an acceptable time frame. We also rely on other software and services supplied by vendors, such as communications, analytics and software-as-a-service platforms, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners, including any \npublicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform containing that technology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive loan products or service offerings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our platform and service offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure by our third-party vendors or our failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or other contractual requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have significant vendors that provide us with a number of services to support our platform. If any third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or comply with their contractual requirements, including failure to maintain adequate systems addressing privacy and data protection and security, we could be subject to service outages, regulatory enforcement actions, consumer demands and lawsuits and suffer economic and reputational damage to our business. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service or failure to provide contracted services, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe CFPB and each of the prudential bank regulators that supervise our lending partners have issued guidance stating that institutions under their supervision may be held responsible for the actions of the companies with which they contract. In addition, several state regulators have issued rules that impact how non-banks protect data that is shared by or with third parties, and eight federal regulators recently issued a proposed rule to establish joint standards for collection of information reported to those agencies, including proposed standards for data transmission to the agencies. As a service provider to supervised entities and when subject to state laws on similar topics, we must ensure we have implemented an adequate vendor management program and would have to comply with any data transmission requirements to which our lending partners are subject related to loans our bank partners originated through our marketplace. We or our lending partners could be adversely impacted to the extent we fail to implement a vendor management system that is satisfactory to the CFPB and other regulators or our vendors fail to comply with the legal requirements applicable to the particular products or services being offered. Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.\nThe CFPB and other regulators have also issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, including, for example, the June 2023 interagency guidance on third party risk management and the supplement guidance released for community banks issued in March 2024. Such guidance increases the scope of management involvement in connection with using third-party vendors. Moreover, if regulators conclude that we or our lending partners have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we or our lending partners could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf loans originated by our lending partners were found to violate the laws of one or more states, whether at origination or after sale by the lending partner, loans facilitated through our marketplace may be unenforceable or otherwise impaired, we or our lending partners or institutional investors may be subject to, among other things, fines and penalties, and/or our commercial relationships may suffer, each of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWhen establishing the interest rates and structures (and the amounts and structures of certain fees constituting interest under federal and state banking laws, such as origination fees, late fees and non-sufficient funds fees) that are charged to borrowers on loans originated through our marketplace, our lending partners rely on authority under federal law to export the interest rate requirements of each lending partner’s home state. Further, we, our securitization vehicles and our institutional investors that purchase Upstart-powered loans originated by our lending partners rely on the ability, as subsequent holders of the loans, to continue charging the interest rates and fee structures and enforce other contractual terms agreed to between the lending partners and the borrowers, as permitted under federal banking laws. The current maximum annual percentage rate of the loans facilitated through our marketplace is 35.99% and in some cases, the maximum rate is lower based on regulatory or legislative action in a particular state. In other states, the interest rates and fee structures of certain Upstart-powered loans exceed the maximum interest rate or may not align with the fee structure permitted for consumer loans applicable to non-bank lenders to borrowers residing in, or that have nexus to, such states. In 2024, several states introduced legislation to opt out of the federal law that allows for the exportation of interest rates by state-chartered banks, which, if passed, would arguably prevent out-of-state banks from exporting their higher interest rates into the states that opted out. Iowa opted out of rate exportation many years ago and more recently, Colorado passed legislation to opt out, although the law is the subject of litigation and is not currently enforceable. \nUsury, fee, and disclosure related claims involving Upstart-powered loans may be raised in multiple ways. We or the participants in our marketplace, including lending partners and institutional investors, may face litigation, government enforcement or other challenges, for example, based on claims that our lending partners did not establish loan terms that were permissible in the state they were located or did not correctly identify the home state in which they were located for purposes of interest exportation authority under federal law. Alternatively, we or our institutional investors may face litigation, government enforcement or other challenge, for example, based on claims that rates and fees were lawful at origination and through any period during which the lending partner retained the loan and interests therein, but following the sale of loans, we or other purchasers of the loans, including our institutional investors, are not permitted to enforce the loans pursuant to their contracted-for terms, or that while certain disclosures were not required at origination because the loans were originated by banks, they may be required following the sale of such loans.\nIn Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC, 786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S.Ct. 2505 (June 27, 2016), for example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the non-bank purchaser of defaulted credit card debt could not rely on preemption standards under the National Bank Act applicable to the originator of such debt in defense of usury claims. The Madden case addressed circumstances under which a defaulted extension of credit under a consumer credit card account was assigned, following default, to a non-bank debt buyer that then attempted to collect the loan and to continue charging interest at the contracted-for rate. The debtor filed a suit claiming, among other claims, that the rate charged by the non-bank collection entity exceeded the usury rates allowable for such entities under New York usury law. Reversing a lower court decision, the Second Circuit held that preemption standards under the National Bank Act applicable to the bank that issued the credit card were not available to the non-bank debt buyer as a defense to usury claims. Following denial of a petition for rehearing by the Second Circuit, the defendant sought review by the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on June 27, 2016, and therefore, the Second Circuit’s decision remains binding on federal courts in the Second Circuit (which include all federal courts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont). Upon remand to the District Court for consideration of additional issues, the parties settled the matter in 2019.\nThe scope and validity of the Second Circuit’s Madden decision remain subject to challenge and clarification, including outside of the Second Circuit. For example, the Colorado Administrator of the Colorado Uniform Consumer Credit Code, or the UCCC, reached a settlement with respect to complaints against two online lending platforms whose operations share certain commonalities with ours, including with respect to the role of lending partners originating loans and non-bank purchasers of such loans. The complaints included, among other claims, allegations, grounded in the Second Circuit’s Madden decision, that the rates and fees for certain loans could not be enforced lawfully by non-bank purchasers of bank-originated loans. Under the settlement, the banks and non-bank purchasers committed to, among other things, limit the annual percentage rates, or APR, on loans to Colorado consumers to 36% and take other actions to ensure that the banks were in fact the true lenders. The non-bank purchasers also agreed to obtain and maintain a Colorado lending license. In Colorado, this settlement created a helpful model for what constitutes an acceptable bank partnership model; however, Colorado passed legislation to opt out of the federal law that allows state-chartered banks to export their rates, with such law scheduled to become effective July 1, 2024 but was later subject to an injunction pending the outcome of a legal challenge of the law. Regardless, the settlement may also invite other states to initiate their own actions, and set their own regulatory standards through enforcement.\nIn addition, in June 2019, private plaintiffs filed class action complaints against multiple traditional credit card securitization programs, including, Petersen, et al. v. Chase Card Funding, LLC, et al., (No. 1:19-cv-00741-LJV-JJM (W.D.N.Y. June 6, 2019)) and Cohen, et al. v. Capital One Funding, LLC et al., (No. 19-03479 (E.D.N.Y. June 12, 2019)). In Petersen, the plaintiffs sought class action status against certain defendants affiliated with a national bank that have acted as special purpose entities in securitization transactions sponsored by the bank. The complaint alleged that the defendants’ acquisition, collection and enforcement of the bank’s credit card receivables violated New York’s civil usury law and that, as in Madden, the defendants, as non-bank entities, are not entitled to the benefit of federal preemption of state usury law. The complaint sought a judgment declaring the receivables unenforceable, monetary damages and other legal and equitable remedies, such as disgorgement of all sums paid in excess of the usury limit. The Cohen case involved a materially similar claim against another national bank. In September 2020, both District Courts dismissed the Peterson and Cohen finding that the usury claims were expressly preempted by the National Bank Act and that a subsequent sale, assignment or transfer of a valid loan (e.g. credit card receivables) did not affect legally permissible interest charged on such loans. The plaintiffs in both cases filed, but ultimately dropped, their appeals of the decision to the second circuit.\nAs noted above, federal prudential regulators have also taken actions to address the Madden decision. The OCC and FDIC each issued rules in 2020 clarifying that, when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, interest permissible before the transfer continues to be permissible after the transfer. Both rules were subject to legal challenge, with several states challenging permissible interest rates post-loan transfer on the grounds that the OCC and FDIC exceeded their authority when promulgating those rules. While the court ruled in favor of the OCC and FDIC holding that the agencies did not exceed their statutory authorities when promulgating their “valid when made” rules, there is risk that the OCC and FDIC rules continue to be challenged or are repealed in the future through legislation. \nThere are factual distinctions between our program and the circumstances addressed in the Second Circuit’s Madden decision, as well as the circumstances in the Colorado UCCC settlement, credit card securitization litigation, and similar cases. As noted above, there are also bases on which the Madden decision’s validity might be subject to challenge or the Madden decision may be addressed by federal regulation or legislation. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that a Madden-like claim will not be brought against us, our lending partners or our institutional investors. \nBy the end of 2024, at least twelve (12) states had or proposed to enact true lender laws. Also known as anti-evasion laws, true lender laws are statutory tests, providing that a non-bank entity is a “lender” subject to certain requirements of the state consumer lending license laws if the entity, among other things: (i) has the predominant economic interest in a loan; (ii) brokers, arranges, or facilitates a loan with a greater rate of interest than is permitted by the state’s lending laws; (iii) brokers, arranges or facilitates a loan and and has the right to purchase the loan; or (iv) based on the totality of the circumstances, appears to be the lender (e.g. operates or controls the credit program). Washington most recently passed a true lender law that became effective June 6, 2024. More states may also \ninstitute similar statutory “true lender” tests, which may increase the risk of true lender litigation in certain jurisdictions. More true lender tests may also result in increased usury and licensing risk or an unwillingness by our lending partners or investors to originate or purchase loans in states with these laws. Other states may take different paths to promulgate similar “true lender” restrictions, and if not through a legislative path, impacted parties may have little to no advance notice of new restrictions and compliance obligations (e.g. Massachusetts recently concluded a non-bank entity was the true lender using the state’s unfair and deceptive practices statute)..\nIf a borrower or any state agency were to successfully bring a claim against us, our lending partners, our securitization vehicles and/or the trustees of such vehicles or our institutional investors that we are the true lender and therefore, violated for a state usury law or fee limitation or state licensing requirement or restriction, we, our lending partners, securitization vehicles and/or trustees or institutional investors may face various commercial and legal repercussions, including that such parties would not receive the total amount of interest expected, and in some cases, may not receive any interest or principal, may hold loans that are void, voidable, rescindable, or otherwise impaired or may be subject to monetary, injunctive or criminal penalties. Were such repercussions to apply to us, we may suffer direct monetary loss or may be a less attractive candidate for lending partners, securitization trustees or institutional investors to enter into or renew relationships; and were such repercussions to apply to our lending partners or institutional investors, such parties could be discouraged from using our marketplace. We may also be subject to payment of damages in situations where we agreed to provide indemnification, as well as fines and penalties assessed by state and federal regulatory agencies.\nIf loans facilitated through our marketplace for one or more lending partners were subject to successful challenge that the lending partner was not the “true lender,” such loans may be unenforceable, subject to rescission or otherwise impaired, we or other program participants may be subject to penalties, and/or our commercial relationships may suffer, each which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLoans originated though Upstart’s marketplace are originated in reliance on the fact that our lending partners are the “true lenders” for such loans. Their true lender status determines various loan program details, and Upstart-powered loans may involve interest rates and structures (including certain fees and fees structures) permissible at origination because the loan terms and lending practices are set by duly chartered and insured banks or credit unions. Because the loans facilitated by our marketplace are originated by our lending partners, many state consumer financial regulatory requirements, including usury restrictions (other than the restrictions of the state in which a lending partner originating the loans is located) and many licensing requirements and substantive requirements under state consumer credit laws, are inapplicable to the loans, based on principles of federal preemption or express exemptions provided in relevant state laws .\nCertain recent litigation and regulatory enforcement has challenged, or is currently challenging, the characterization of bank partners as the “true lender” of loans in connection with programs involving origination and/or servicing relationships between a bank partner and non-bank lending platform or program manager. As noted above, the Colorado Administrator has entered into a settlement agreement with certain banks and non-banks that addresses this true lender issue, such settlement to end in 2025 or under the change to Colorado law to prohibit rate exportation to the state. Other states could also bring lawsuits based on these types of bank-partnership relationships. For example, in June 2020, the Washington, D.C. Attorney General filed a lawsuit against online lender Elevate for allegedly deceptively marketing high-cost loans with interest rates above the District’s usury cap of 24%. The usury claim is based on an allegation that Elevate, and not its partner bank, is the true lender of these loans, and was therefore in violation of the state’s usury laws. This case ultimately settled, with Elevate agreeing to charge rates only up to 24%, instead of rates over 100%, and to refund consumers who were charged rates over what is allowed under Washington, DC law. Similarly, in June 2021, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the online lender Marlette Funding LLC, alleging that the company, doing business as Best Egg, was the true lender of usurious loans originated though a partnership with Cross River Bank, with a rate of interest in excess of the 6% rate permitted to be charged in Pennsylvania by unlicensed non-banks. Furthermore, in April 2022, Opportunity Financial, LLC (“OppFi”) filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to challenge the Department’s application of California usury caps to loans originated on OppFi’s online platform. OppFi argued that the Department was applying a “true lender” test to several loans to California residents that \nexceeded the applicable California usury limit for small dollar loans, even though such test does not exist in California law. While OppFi received a favorable decision in October 2023 that denied California’s motion for preliminary injunction, in California and other states where OppFi faced legal challenges, the case has not yet been resolved and there is an ongoing risk that government agencies and private plaintiffs will seek to challenge these types of relationships that are similar to our business model. Finally, in June 2024, the Massachusetts Attorney General entered into a settlement with a fintech company it believed to be the true lender of loans originated using the bank partnership model, relying on the state’s UDAAP authority to reach such a conclusion, rather than a state licensing or true lender law.\nWe note that the OCC issued on October 27, 2020, a final rule to address the “true lender” issue for lending transactions involving a national bank. For certain purposes related to federal banking law, including the ability of a national bank to “export” interest-related requirements from the state from which they lend, the rule would treat a national bank as the “true lender” if it is named as the lender in the loan agreement or funds the loan. However, the rule was subsequently challenged by the Attorneys General from seven states and ultimately repealed by Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act on June 30, 2021. Although supported by the FDIC, no similar rule applicable to state-chartered banks was issued by the FDIC, and thus there is no clear federal standard.\nWhile we have taken steps to comply with the safe harbor in the Colorado settlement and other laws, regulations and guidance, we, lending partners, institutional investors, securitization vehicles and other similarly situated parties could become subject to challenges like those presented above, by private actions or by state or federal regulators, and, if so, we could face penalties and/or Upstart-powered loans may be void, voidable or otherwise impaired in a manner that may have adverse effects on our operations (directly, or as a result of adverse impact on our relationships with our lending partners, institutional investors or other commercial counterparties). There have been no formal proceedings against us or indication of any proceedings against us to date, but there can be no assurance that the Colorado Administrator or any other regulator will not make assertions similar to those made in its present actions with respect to the loans facilitated by our marketplace in the future. \nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the 2026 Notes (as defined below) and 2029 Notes (as defined below) are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the past resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a counterparty to a capped call transaction becomes subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under the relevant capped call transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase to the extent there is an increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations by a counterparty, we may suffer adverse consequences or experience more dilution with respect to our common stock than anticipated. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any of the counterparties.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nLitigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including class action lawsuits and other litigation. Generally, this litigation arises from the dissatisfaction of a consumer with the products or services offered on our marketplace; some of this litigation, however, has arisen from other matters, including claims of violation of laws related to credit reporting, statements made regarding our business and prospects, collections, and do-not-call requests or restrictions. All such legal actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. In addition, certain actions may include claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Our involvement in any such matter also could cause significant harm to our or our lending partners’ reputations, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor. If resolved against us, legal actions could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business.\nIn addition, a number of participants in the consumer financial services industry have been the subject of putative class action lawsuits, state attorney general actions and other state regulatory actions or federal regulatory enforcement actions alleging noncompliance with various laws and regulations relating to originating, servicing and collecting consumer loans and providing consumer financial services and products, including actions relating to alleged unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, violations of state licensing and lending laws, including state usury and disclosure laws and actions alleging discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other prohibited bases. The current regulatory environment, increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement have resulted in us undertaking significant time-consuming and expensive operational and compliance efforts to operate in accordance with relevant laws, which may delay or preclude our or our lending partners’ ability to provide certain new products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not, in the future, affect how we conduct our business and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, legal proceedings brought under state or federal consumer protection statutes may result in a separate fine assessed for each violation or substantial damages from class action lawsuits, potentially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities or that may be covered by our insurance.\nSome of the agreements used in the course of our business include arbitration clauses that permit either party to request arbitration. If our arbitration agreements were to become unenforceable for any reason, we could experience an increase to our consumer litigation costs and exposure to potentially damaging class action lawsuits, with a potential material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe contest our liability and the amount of damages, as appropriate, in each pending matter. The outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and result in financial remediation to impacted borrowers. These self-identified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant, depending on the issue and the number of borrowers impacted, and could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional risk.\nWe are subject to or facilitate compliance with a variety of federal, state, and local laws, including those related to consumer protection and lending requirements.\nWe must comply with regulatory regimes or facilitate compliance with regulatory regimes on behalf of our lending partners that are independently subject to federal and/or state oversight by bank regulators, including those applicable to our referral and marketing services, consumer credit transactions, loan servicing and collection activities and the purchase and sale of whole loans and other related transactions. It is possible that regulators in the current or future presidential administrations could promulgate rulemakings and bring enforcement actions that materially impact our business and the business of our lending partners. These regulators may augment requirements that apply to loans facilitated by our marketplace, or impose new programs and restrictions, and could otherwise revise or create new regulatory requirements that apply to us (or our lending partners), impacting our business, operations, and profitability.\nFederal and certain state laws regulate financial products and services, including requirements that apply to the origination, servicing and collection of loans originated on our marketplace, and the purchase and sale of whole loans or asset-backed securitizations. In particular, the laws, regulations and rules we or our lending partners are subject to include:\n•state lending laws and regulations that require certain parties to hold licenses or other government approvals or filings in connection with specified lending activities, and impose requirements related to brokering loans, loan disclosures and terms, fees and interest rates, credit discrimination, credit reporting, servicemember relief, debt collection, repossession, unfair or deceptive business practices and consumer protection, as well as other state laws relating to privacy, information security, conduct in connection with data breaches and money transmission;\n•the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions, require creditors to comply with certain lending practice restrictions, limit the ability of a creditor to impose certain loan terms;\n•the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, and similar state fair lending laws, which prohibit creditors from discouraging or discriminating against credit applicants on a prohibited basis, including race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act;\n•the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V promulgated thereunder, which impose certain obligations on users of consumer reports and those that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies, including obligations relating to obtaining consumer reports, marketing using consumer reports, taking adverse action on the basis of information from consumer reports, addressing risks of identity theft and fraud and protecting the privacy and security of consumer reports and consumer report information, including the CFPB’s recent proposed amendments to Regulation V that could add additional requirements thereunder if not withdrawn;\n•Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service, and analogous state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;\n•the Credit Practices Rule which (i) prohibits lenders from using certain contract provisions that the Federal Trade Commission has found to be unfair to consumers; and (ii) prohibits certain activity relating to the assessment of late charges;\n•the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and Regulation F promulgated thereunder, and similar state debt collection laws, which provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors (and some limitation on creditors collecting their own debts) in connection with the collection of consumer debts;\n•the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, and similar state privacy laws, which include limitations on financial institutions’ disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy notices and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and unaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal borrower information, and other state privacy laws and regulations;\n•the Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection;\n•the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and similar state laws, which allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations, requires creditors to reduce the interest rate to 6% on loans to military members under certain circumstances, and imposes restrictions on enforcement of loans to servicemembers, so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties;\n•the Military Lending Act, which requires those who lend to “covered borrowers”, including members of the military and their dependents, to only offer Military APRs (a specific measure of all-in-cost-of-credit) under 36%, prohibits arbitration clauses in loan agreements, and prohibits certain other loan agreement terms and lending practices in connection with loans to military servicemembers, among other requirements, and for which violations may result in penalties including voiding of the loan agreement;\n•the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which provide guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts, including a prohibition on a creditor requiring a consumer to repay a credit agreement in preauthorized (recurring) electronic fund transfers and disclosure and authorization requirements in connection with such transfers;\n•the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which impose various consumer consent requirements and other restrictions in connection with telemarketing activity and other communication with consumers by phone, fax or text message, and which provide guidelines designed to safeguard consumer privacy in connection with such communications;\n•the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and similar state laws, which impose various restrictions on commercial marketing conducted use of email, telephone, fax or text message;\n•the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures and which require creditors and loan servicers to obtain a consumer’s consent to electronically receive disclosures required under federal and state laws and regulations that would otherwise be provided in a physical writing;\n•the Right to Financial Privacy Act and similar state laws enacted to provide financial institution customers a reasonable amount of privacy from government scrutiny of their financial records;\n•the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, which relate to compliance with anti-money laundering, borrower due diligence and record-keeping policies and procedures;\n•the regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Treasury Department related to the administration and enforcement of sanctions against foreign jurisdictions and persons that threaten U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, primarily to prevent targeted jurisdictions and persons from accessing the U.S. financial system;\n•federal and state securities laws, including, among others, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the IAA, and the Investment Company Act, rules and regulations adopted under those laws, and similar state laws and regulations, which govern how we offer, sell and transact in our loan financing products; and\n•other state-specific and local laws and regulations.\nWe may not always have been, and may not always be, in compliance with these and other applicable laws, regulations and rules. And while compliance with these requirements is a business priority for us, it is also costly, time-consuming and limits our operational flexibility. Additionally, Congress, the states and regulatory agencies, as well as local municipalities, could further regulate the consumer financial services industry in ways that make it more difficult or costly for us to offer our AI lending marketplace and related services or facilitate the origination of loans for our lending partners. These laws also are subject to changes that could severely limit the operations of our business model. Further, changes in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions also could impact the manner in which we conduct our business. The regulatory environment in which financial institutions operate has become increasingly complex, and following the financial crisis that began in 2008, supervisory efforts to apply relevant laws, regulations and policies have become more intense. Additionally, states are increasingly introducing and, in some cases, passing laws that restrict interest rates and APRs on loans similar to the loans made on our marketplace, which could end rate exportation in their states by out-of-state, state-chartered banks. Colorado was the first state to enact such legislation since Iowa, and other states have proposed similar legislation. Further, in late 2020, California created the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (“DFPI”), a “mini-CFPB,” through expansion of regulation of financial service providers under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law. This increases the state’s authority and oversight of bank partnership relationships and strengthens state consumer protection authority to police debt collections and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. Voter referendums also have introduced and, in some cases, passed, restrictions on interest rates and/or APRs. If such legislation or bills were to be propagated with rates and/or APRs under 36%, or if state or federal regulators seek to restrict regulated financial institutions such as our lending partners from engaging in business with Upstart in certain ways, our lending partners’ ability to originate loans in certain states could be greatly reduced, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWhere applicable, we seek to comply with state broker, small loan, automobile lender, finance lender, servicing, collection, money transmitter and similar statutes. Nevertheless, if we are found to not comply with applicable laws, we could lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, become subject to greater scrutiny by other state regulatory agencies, face other sanctions or be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to facilitate loans, perform our servicing obligations or make our marketplace available to consumers in particular states, which may harm our business. Further, failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and operations may, among other things, limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on Upstart-powered loans. In addition, non-compliance could subject us to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, rescission rights held by investors in securities offerings and civil and criminal liability, all of which would harm our business.\nInternet-based loan origination processes may give rise to greater risks than paper-based processes and may not always be allowed under state law.\nWe use the internet to obtain application information and distribute certain legally required notices to applicants and borrowers, and to obtain electronically signed loan documents in lieu of paper documents with actual borrower signatures. These processes may entail greater risks than would paper-based loan origination processes, including risks regarding the sufficiency of notice for compliance with consumer protection laws, risks that borrowers may challenge the authenticity of loan documents, and risks that despite internal controls, unauthorized changes are made to the electronic loan documents. In addition, our software could contain “bugs” that result in incorrect calculations or disclosures or other non-compliance with federal or state laws or regulations. If any of those factors were to cause any loans, or any of the terms of the loans, to be unenforceable against the borrowers, or impair our ability to service loans, the performance of the underlying loan documents could be adversely affected.\nFor auto loans issued through our auto lending marketplace, certain state laws may not allow for electronic lien and title transfer, which would require us to use a paper-based title process to secure title to the underlying collateral. Because it is highly manual and outside of our usual practices and titling rules can vary by state, we may be prone to errors or delays in placing titles or otherwise encounter greater difficulty complying with the proper \nprocedures. If we fail to effectively follow such procedures we may, among other things, be limited in our ability to secure the collateral associated with loans issued through our auto lending marketplace.\nIf we are found to be operating without having obtained necessary state or local licenses, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain states have adopted laws regulating and requiring licensing by parties that engage in certain activities regarding consumer finance transactions, including facilitating and assisting such transactions or in connection with collecting, servicing and/or purchasing or selling consumer loans. While we believe we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary licenses, the application of some consumer finance licensing laws to our AI lending marketplace and the related activities we perform, as well as to our lending partners, is unclear. In addition, state licensing requirements and state regulators’ interpretation of such requirements may evolve over time, including, in particular, recent trends toward increased licensing requirements and regulation of parties engaged in loan solicitation, student loan servicing activities and debt collection. If we or one of our lending partners were found to be in violation of applicable state licensing requirements by a court or a state, federal, or local enforcement agency, we could be subject to fines, damages, injunctive relief (including required modification or discontinuation of our business in certain areas), criminal penalties and other penalties or consequences, and the loans originated by our lending partners on our marketplace could be rendered void or unenforceable in whole or in part, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe CFPB has sometimes taken expansive views of its authority to regulate consumer financial services, creating uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other agency could impact our business.\nThe CFPB, which commenced operations in July 2011, has broad authority to create and modify regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, such as the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, ECOA and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, among other regulations, and to enforce compliance with those laws. The CFPB has broad enforcement authority over all providers of financial products and services. The CFPB also has supervisory authority over banks, thrifts and credit unions with assets over $10 billion and certain participants in the consumer financial services market, including short-term, small dollar lenders, non-bank mortgage originators and servicers, and larger participants in other areas of financial services, including some of our lending partners and Upstart Mortgage LLC. The CFPB is also authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement and supervisory activity, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products offered through our marketplace, and recently finalized a rule establishing a public registry for final orders issued against non-banks subject to CFPB enforcement actions. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. The CFPB may also request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities and conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.\nIn May 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that the CFPB’s funding structure is constitutional, and although more recent actions have been filed that challenge the CFPB’s authority on other grounds, the Supreme Court’s decision ended uncertainty about the future of the CFPB and how its strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our business and our results of operations going forward. In the aftermath, the CFPB increased hiring in its Enforcement Division and created a Repeat Offender Unit. In February 2024, the CFPB published a decision and order in a supervisory designation proceeding against a non-bank installment lender that, for the first time, officially established the CFPB’s supervisory authority over a non-bank entity not otherwise subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority due to the risk the non-bank lender posed to consumers. The CFPB opined that risk does not need to be based on a violation of law. The CFPB exercised this previously dormant authority for the second time in December 2024, establishing supervisory authority over a technology company offering a peer-to-peer payment product. If the CFPB decides to subject us to its supervisory process, it could significantly increase the level of regulatory scrutiny of our business practices. However, as of the filing of this Annual Report Form 10-K, given that the priorities and direction of the CFPB and other federal \nagencies under the new U.S. presidential administration are unclear, we we cannot be certain how the regulatory environment may impact our business. See the risk factor titled “—Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations” for more information.\nIn addition, evolving views regarding the use of alternative variables and machine learning in assessing credit risk could result in the CFPB taking actions that result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected financial products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them. See the risk factor titled “—Our reputation and brand are important to our success, and if we are unable to continue developing our reputation and brand, our ability to retain existing and attract new bank partners, our ability to attract borrowers to our marketplace, our ability to maintain diverse and resilient loan funding and our ability to maintain and improve our relationship with regulators of our industry could be adversely affected” for more information. The CFPB could also implement rules that restrict our effectiveness in servicing our financial products and services.\nAlthough we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs, future actions by the CFPB (or other regulators) against us, our lending partners or our competitors could discourage the use of our services or those of our lending partners, which could result in reputational harm, a loss of lending partners, borrowers or institutional investors, or discourage the use of our or their services and adversely affect our business, especially now that actions resulting in orders will be subject to publication on the CFPB’s public registry. If the CFPB changes regulations that were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act, or modifies through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us, the industry or other regulators, our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially. This is particularly true with respect to the application of ECOA and Regulation B to credit risk models that rely upon alternative variables and machine learning, an area of law where regulatory guidance is currently uncertain and still evolving, and for which there are not well-established regulatory norms for establishing compliance. \nThe former presidential administration appointed consumer-oriented regulators at federal agencies such as the CFPB, the FTC, the OCC and the FDIC. While we expect the government to continue its focus on enforcement of federal consumer protection laws, it remains to be seen how the new presidential administration will address consumer protection under new leadership. It is possible that these regulators could promulgate rulemakings and bring enforcement actions that materially impact our business and the business of our lending partners. If future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer certain of our products or that require us to make significant changes to our business practices, and if we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns, these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the CFPB, or another regulator, were to issue a consent decree or other similar order against us or our lending partners, this could also directly or indirectly affect our results of operations.\nOur compliance and operational costs and litigation exposure could increase if and when the CFPB or another agency amends or finalizes any proposed regulations, including the regulations discussed above or if the CFPB or other regulators enact new regulations, change regulations that were previously adopted, modify, through supervision or enforcement, past regulatory guidance, or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted.\nWe have been in the past and may in the future be subject to federal and state regulatory inquiries regarding our business.\nWe have, from time to time in the normal course of our business, received, and may in the future receive or be subject to, inquiries or investigations by state and federal regulatory agencies and bodies such as the CFPB, the FTC, state Attorneys General, the SEC, state financial regulatory agencies and other state or federal agencies or bodies regarding the Upstart marketplace, including the marketing of loans for lenders, underwriting and pricing of consumer loans for our lending partners, our fair lending compliance program and licensing and registration requirements. While we expect to address inquiries or investigations and engage in open dialogue with regulators, we cannot guarantee that a federal or state regulator will not take supervisory or enforcement action against us in the \nfuture. Since the no-action letter with the CFPB was terminated in June 2022, we no longer enjoy the protection of the no-action letter which had provided that the CFPB would not take supervisory or enforcement action against us for a violation of ECOA. We intend to continue to pursue a transparent and cooperative relationship with the CFPB, which could involve sharing information about our models and other aspects of our business. It is also possible the CFPB may take supervisory or enforcement action against us in the future.\nWe have also received inquiries from state regulatory agencies regarding requirements to obtain licenses from or register with those states, including in states where we have determined that we are not required to obtain such a license or be registered with the state, and we expect to continue to receive such inquiries. Any such inquiries or investigations could involve substantial time and expense to analyze and respond to, could divert management’s attention and other resources from running our business, and could lead to public enforcement actions or lawsuits and fines, penalties, injunctive relief, and the need to obtain additional licenses that we do not currently possess. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to additional investigations and enforcement actions from other agencies or litigants, and further divert management attention and resources from the operation of our business. Formal enforcement actions are generally made public, which also carries reputational risk. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the initiation of a regulatory investigation of Upstart or even the perception that such an investigation could occur, even in the absence of any finding by a regulator that we have violated any state or federal law. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions arising out of any state or federal inquiries we receive could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFor non-bank financial institutions, the FTC is also a primary regulator, and in recent years the FTC has been focused on practices of financial technology companies. Based on publicly available actions, the FTC’s primary focus has been with respect to financial technology company marketing and disclosure practices. For instance, in October 2018 the FTC took action against student loan refinance lender SoFi, claiming that the company made prominent false statements regarding the average savings a consumer would realize over the lifetime of the loan if they refinanced with SoFi. In addition, SoFi allegedly exaggerated claims of anticipated borrower savings by excluding certain customer populations from the analysis. In addition, in July 2021 the FTC settled litigation with LendingClub regarding, among other things, the adequacy of its disclosures of an origination fee associated with the product. Moreover, the FTC recently issued a staff report on digital “dark patterns,” sophisticated design practices that can trick or manipulate consumers into buying products or services or giving up their private information, that, among other things, highlighted marketing and disclosure practices by some financial technology companies that the FTC claimed were deceptive because of their use of dark patterns. Based upon prior enforcement actions, staff reports, and statements by FTC officials, we believe this scrutiny of financial technology company marketing and disclosure practices will continue in the near future. While we maintain policies and procedures that require our marketing and loan application and servicing operations comply with UDAP standards, we may not be successful in our efforts to achieve compliance either due to internal or external factors, such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information could give rise to liabilities as a result of existing or new governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, transmit and store large volumes of personal information and other sensitive data, which may potentially include biometric data as defined by state law, from applicants and borrowers. Each lending partner can access information about their respective borrowers and declined applicants via daily loan reports and other reporting tools that are provided via the platform. For loan institutional investors, while we generally limit access to personal information, we do share some personal information about borrowers with certain institutional investors. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and sensitive data including those specific to biometric data. Specifically, cybersecurity and data privacy issues, particularly with respect to personal information, are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted. For example, the GLBA includes limitations on financial institutions’ disclosure of nonpublic personal information \nabout a consumer to non-affiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by non-affiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy notices and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and unaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal borrower information. Privacy requirements under the GLBA are enforced by the CFPB, as well as the FTC, and under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, we and our lending partners are prohibited from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or UDAP. For example, both the FTC and CFPB have relied on UDAP/UDAAP principles to increase enforcement of “dark patterns”, the definition of which varies but has been defined as “design features used to deceive, steer, or manipulate users into behavior that is profitable for an online service, but often harmful to users or contrary to their intent.” We are and our lending partners are also prohibited from sharing consumer information without proper notification and consent. For example, lawsuits were recently filed against TD Bank and Capital One for alleged privacy violations under GLBA and similar state privacy laws and unfair and deceptive practices under UDAAP, for the alleged sharing of nonpublic personal information (“NPI”) with Meta without (1) properly disclosing in the bank’s privacy policy or elsewhere that NPI was shared with Meta; and (2) allowing customers to opt out of having their NPI shared with Meta.\nAt the state level, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, requires, among other things, that covered companies provide disclosures to California residents and afford such persons new abilities to opt-out of certain sales or retention of their personal information by us. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain unclear. In addition, California voters approved Proposition 24 in the November 2020 election to create the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which amends and purports to strengthen the CCPA and created a state agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to enforce privacy laws. The CPRA amendments create obligations relating to consumer data as of January 1, 2023 (with a one-year lookback), and enforcement beginning March 29, 2024. Following the enactment of the CCPA, certain states, including but not limited to Texas, Virginia, Colorado, Maryland, Oregon and Utah, have enacted, and other states are proposing to enact, laws and regulations that impose obligations similar to the CCPA or that otherwise involve significant obligations and restrictions. While many of these laws include exemptions for information covered by the GLBA, and we therefore may be exempt from all or most obligations under many of these state privacy laws, some states may not provide for such exemptions, and such exemptions may not fully exempt us from compliance with state laws. \nMany privacy and data security laws, such as the CCPA, apply to biometric data. Some states also have passed or are considering legislation that is biometric-specific. For instance, in Illinois, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA, specifically governs the collection, possession, and disclosure of biometric information or biometric identifiers. There has been a corresponding increase in litigation related specifically to state biometric privacy laws. Whether information we receive from borrowers is subject to state laws expressly governing biometric data depends on how such laws define “biometric data” or other similar terms of art.\nCompliance with current and future borrower privacy data protection and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technical or operating costs. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA, BIPA, or other privacy and data security state laws on our business or operations, but it may require us to further modify our data infrastructure and data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to continue to comply. Further, any actual or perceived violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices, data infrastructure or operational structure, address legal claims and regulatory investigations and proceedings and sustain monetary penalties and/or other harms to our business. We could also be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or change our business practices or privacy policies.\nAs the regulatory framework for AI and machine learning technology evolves, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe regulatory framework for AI and machine learning technology is evolving and remains uncertain. For example, in April 2023, the FTC, DOJ, EEOC and CFPB released a joint statement on potential “threats” posed by AI, such as contributing to discriminatory outcomes. Additionally, the CFPB published statements in May 2022 and September 2023 on the applicability of ECOA to AI and machine learning underwriting models when generating adverse action notices. Several federal agencies including the CFPB and Treasury Department have issued requests for information to investigate the impacts of AI on the provision of financial goods and services. \nThere is also a significant amount of proposed legislation at the state and federal levels addressing the use and development of AI and on AI governance and oversight. For example, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (the “CAIA”), the first comprehensive state AI regulation, will go into effect in February 2026. Among other things, the CAIA imposes a duty of reasonable care on developers and deployers to avoid “algorithmic discrimination” in high-risk AI systems, and sets forth various disclosure, risk assessment, and governance requirements.\nHowever, the language of the primary fair lending regulation (i.e. ECOA) remains unaltered. Therefore, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the operation of our marketplace and the way in which we use AI and machine learning technology, including with respect to fair lending laws. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nIf we are required to register under the Investment Company Act, our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. In general, an “investment company” is a company that holds itself out as an investment company or holds more than 40% of the total value of its assets (minus cash and government securities) in “investment securities.” We believe we are not an investment company. Our business involves developing and operating an online lending marketplace that provides our lending partners with access to technology, including proprietary AI models, and related services, so lending partners can assess the credit risk of potential borrowers and offer loans online, and our revenue derives primarily from fees based on the platform and referral services provided to our lending partners and loan servicing. We do not hold ourselves out as an investment company. We understand, however, that the loans held on our balance sheet could be viewed by the SEC or its staff as “securities,” which could in turn cause the SEC or its staff to view Upstart Holdings, Inc., Upstart Network, Inc., or an affiliate as an “investment company” subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. We believe that we have never been an investment company because, among other reasons, we are primarily engaged in the business of providing an AI-based lending marketplace, and therefore can reasonably rely on exemptions from investment company status.\nIf we are not able to rely on exemptions from investment company status, we could be deemed an investment company and may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements, restricting our activities in a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, among other things, we could be subject to investment company governance requirements; restricted as to future borrowings and in our transactions with affiliates; and be more limited in available corporate financing alternatives and compensation arrangements. If we were ever deemed to be in non-compliance with the Investment Company Act, we could also be subject to various penalties, including administrative or judicial proceedings that might result in censure, fine, civil penalties, cease-and-desist orders or other adverse consequences, as well as private rights of action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we are required to register under the Investment Advisers Act, our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe IAA contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment advisers” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We do not believe that we or our affiliates are required to register as an investment adviser with either the SEC or any of the various states, because our business consists of providing a marketplace for consumer lending and loan financing for which investment adviser registration and regulation does not apply under applicable federal or state law. However, one of our affiliates, Upstart Network, Inc., has notice filed as an exempt reporting adviser with the state of California based on its limited activities advising a fund.\nWhile we believe our current practices do not require us or any of our other affiliates or subsidiaries to register or notice file as an investment adviser, or require us to extend regulations related to Upstart Network, Inc.’s status as an exempt reporting adviser to our other operations, if a regulator were to disagree with our analysis with respect to any portion of our business, we or a subsidiary may be required to register or notice file as an investment adviser and to comply with applicable law. Registering as an investment adviser could adversely affect our method of operation and revenues. For example, the IAA requires that an investment adviser act in a fiduciary capacity for its clients. Among other things, this fiduciary obligation requires that an investment adviser manage a client’s portfolio in the best interests of the client, have a reasonable basis for its recommendations, fully disclose to its client any material conflicts of interest that may affect its conduct and seek best execution for transactions undertaken on behalf of its client. The IAA also limits the ways in which a company can market its services and offerings. It could be difficult for us to comply with these obligations without meaningful changes to our business operations, and there is no guarantee that we could do so successfully. If we were ever deemed to be in non-compliance with applicable investment adviser regulations, we could also be subject to various penalties, including administrative or judicial proceedings that might result in censure, fine, civil penalties, cease-and-desist orders or other adverse consequences, as well as private rights of action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our transactions involving institutional investors who provide loan funding to our marketplace are found to have been conducted in violation of the Securities Act or similar state law, or we have generally violated any applicable law, our ability to obtain financing for loans facilitated through our marketplace could be materially adversely affected, and we could be subject to private or regulatory actions.\nCertain transactions involving institutional investors or related to acquisitions may rely or have relied on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided for in Regulation D or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. If any of these transactions were found to not be in compliance with the requirements necessary to qualify for these exemptions from Securities Act registration, or otherwise found to be in violation of the federal or state securities laws, our business could be materially adversely affected. The SEC or state securities regulators could bring enforcement actions against us, or we could be subject to private litigation risks as a result of any violation of the federal or state securities laws, which could result in civil penalties, injunctions and cease and desist orders from further violations, as well as monetary penalties of disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, rescission of securities sales, or civil penalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we are found to be in violation of state or federal law generally, we also may be limited in our ability to conduct future transactions. For example, we could in the future become ineligible to sell securities under Regulation D if we become subject to “bad actor” disqualification pursuant to Rule 506(d) of Regulation D. Under Rule 506(d), issuers are ineligible “bad actors” if they or certain related persons, including directors and certain affiliates, are subject to disqualifying events, including certain cease-and-desist orders obtained by the SEC. If we were subject to this or other “bad actor” provisions of the securities laws, we may not be able to continue sales of whole loans, fractional interests in loans, or asset-backed securities, or we could be subject to significant additional expense associated with making our offerings, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to register with the SEC or under state securities laws as a broker-dealer, our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are not currently registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act or any comparable state law. The SEC heavily regulates the manner in which broker-dealers are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in our being characterized as a broker-dealer, based on guidance published by the SEC and its staff. Among other reasons, this is because we do not believe we take any compensation that would be viewed as being based on any transactions in securities in any of our business lines. To the extent that the SEC or its staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our business operations accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could inhibit our ability to conduct our business operations. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing our broker-dealer status or that SEC guidance will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we are deemed to be a broker-dealer, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to private litigation and potential rescission of certain investments investors in our loan financing products have made, which would harm our operations as well.\nSimilarly, we do not believe that our sales of whole loans and asset-backed securities will subject us to broker-dealer registration in any state in which we operate, primarily because we do not accept compensation that we believe could be viewed as transaction-based. However, if we were deemed to be a broker-dealer under a state’s securities laws, we could face civil penalties, or costly registration requirements, that could adversely affect our business.\nAnti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing, anti-corruption and economic sanctions laws could have adverse consequences for us.\nWe maintain a compliance program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act and U.S. economic sanctions laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing and engaging in transactions involving sanctioned countries, persons and entities. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform borrower due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. During 2020, we failed to file timely reports of suspicious transactions as required with appropriate regulatory agencies. We remediated the failure to file and have added additional resources to support our compliance with these reporting requirements. We are also subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, and the U.S. Travel Act, which prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making, or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector in order to influence official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. We have implemented an anti-corruption policy to ensure compliance with these anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. No assurance is given that our programs and controls will be effective to ensure compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing and anti-corruption laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties, contractual liability to our lending partners or institutional investors, and reputational harm, all of which could harm our business.\nOur securitizations are subject to regulation under federal law, and failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business.\nOur loan securitizations and sales of asset-backed securities are subject to regulation under federal law, and banks and other regulated financial institutions acquiring and holding asset-based securities, including asset-backed securities sponsored by us, are subject to capital and leverage requirements. These requirements, which are costly to comply with, could decrease investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions. For example, the Credit Risk Retention rule, codified as Regulation RR under the Exchange Act, was jointly adopted by the SEC, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2014. Regulation RR generally requires the sponsor of asset-backed securities to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the securities, and generally prohibits the sponsor or its affiliate from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise selling or transferring the retained credit risk for a specified period of time, depending on the type of asset that is securitized. Some aspects of these risk retention rules have not been the subject of significant separate guidance. We believe, but cannot be certain, that we have conducted our business, and will continue to conduct our business, in such a way that we are compliant with these risk retention rules. However, if we have failed to comply, or should fall out of compliance with these rules, it could adversely affect our source of funding and our business.\nWe may also face regulatory risks related to compliance with Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” which prohibits banking entities from acquiring an ownership interest in entities that are investment companies for purposes of the Investment Company Act, or would be investment companies but for Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, which are generally known as “private funds.” This means that in order for a banking entity regulated under the Volcker Rule to purchase certain asset-backed securities issued by our affiliates, such affiliates may need to rely on another exemption or exception from being deemed “investment companies” if they wish to continue selling to banking entities. Currently, those affiliates generally rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which provides an exclusion to the definition of an investment company for issuers that pool income-producing assets and issue securities backed by those assets. However, if a regulator or other third party were to find or assert that our analysis under Rule 3a-7 (or, where applicable, some other exemption or exemption) is incorrect, banks that have purchased asset-backed securities may be able to rescind those sales, which would adversely affect our business. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we have conducted our business, and will continue to conduct our business, in such a way that enables our applicable banking entity investors to be compliant with the Volcker Rule.\nRISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS\nWe rely on borrowings under our warehouse credit facilities to fund certain aspects of our operations, and any inability to meet our obligations as they come due or to comply with various covenants or representations contained in our warehouse credit facilities could harm our business.\nWe, through our warehouse trust special purpose entities, have entered into warehouse credit facilities to partially finance the purchase of certain loans from certain lending partners that originate loans through our marketplace, which credit facilities are secured by the purchased loans. \nUnder our warehouse credit facilities, we may borrow up to an aggregate of $475.0 million to purchase unsecured personal loans, $100.0 million to purchase small dollar loans, and up to $50.0 million to purchase auto loans. Our warehouse credit facilities mature between December 2025 and June 2028, by which time the outstanding principal, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, are due and payable. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount borrowed under our warehouse credit facilities was $195.6 million, and $457.6 million of the aggregate outstanding principal of loans and restricted cash pledged as collateral.\nOur warehouse credit facilities impose operating and financial covenants on the applicable warehouse trust special purpose entity, and under certain events of default, the applicable lender could require that all or a portion of our outstanding borrowings become immediately due and payable or terminate their respective agreement with us. \nWe have in the past, and may in the future, fail to comply with certain operating or financial covenants in our warehouse credit facilities, requiring a waiver from our lenders. If we are unable to repay our obligations at maturity or in the event of default, the applicable borrowing warehouse trust special purpose entity may have to liquidate the loans held as collateral at an inopportune time or price or, if the lender liquidated the loans, such warehouse trust would have to pay any amount by which the original purchase price exceeded their sale price. An event of default would negatively impact our ability to purchase loans from our marketplace and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our costs or which might not be available when needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to limit our loan funding, which could have an adverse effect on our lending partners’ ability or willingness to originate new loans or our ability to use leverage for the loans we hold, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCorporate and asset-backed debt ratings could adversely affect our ability to support loan funding for our marketplace at attractive rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur unsecured senior corporate debt currently has no rating. Asset-backed securities sponsored or co-sponsored by us are currently rated by a limited number of credit rating agencies. Structured finance ratings reflect these rating agencies’ opinions of our receivables credit performance and ability of the receivables cash flows to pay interest on a timely basis and repay the principal of such asset-backed securitizations, as well as our ability to service the receivables and comply with other obligations under such programs, such as the obligation to repurchase loans subject to breaches of loan-level representations and warranties. Such ratings also reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of other service providers in such transactions, such as trustees, back-up servicers, charged-off loan purchasers and others.\nOur asset-backed securities have been subject to downgrades in the past, and any future downgrade or non-publication of ratings may increase the interest rates that are required to attract investment in such asset-backed securities, adversely impacting our ability to provide liquidity or financing to our lending partners and institutional investors. Our lack of parent debt rating and any further downgrades to the ratings of our asset-backed securities could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future, including through equity, equity-linked, or debt financings, to support business growth and those funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new loan products, enhance our AI models, supplement loan funding, improve our operating infrastructure, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, or make strategic investments. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, equity-linked or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. For example, if we elect to deliver shares of our common stock to settle the conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share) of our outstanding Notes (as defined below), it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders’ equity holdings. Further, debt financing, if available, may involve protective provisions or covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may pursue alternate transactions or be unable to pursue certain business opportunities and our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired and our business may be harmed.\nIn August 2021, we issued $661.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). In September 2024, we issued $431.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and in November 2024, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes” and together with the 2026 Notes \nand 2029 Notes, the “Notes”). Concurrently with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, we used $302.4 million of the proceeds to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2026 Notes in individually negotiated transactions, and additionally repurchased a portion of the outstanding 2026 Notes during the third quarter of 2024 through open market purchases.\nHolders of the Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture) with respect to such series of Notes before the applicable maturity date, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of such series to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Additionally, upon conversion of the Notes, as applicable, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes of each series in cash at their respective maturities unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the respective times we are required to make repurchases of the Notes of each series, pay cash for the Notes being converted, or at their respective maturities. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes of each series or to pay cash upon conversion of any such Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness at the time. Our failure to repurchase the Notes of a series at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable Indenture, or to pay any cash payable upon future conversions of the Notes of a series as required by the applicable Indenture would constitute a default under such Indenture. A default under the applicable Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes of each series, pay cash with respect to the Notes being converted, or at the respective maturities of the Notes.\nProvisions in the Indentures governing our 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\nIf a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date for a series of Notes, holders of the applicable series of Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the applicable Indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date of the applicable series of Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes of such series in connection with such make-whole fundamental change in the manner specified in the applicable Indenture. Furthermore, the Indentures prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the Indentures could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to you.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAXES\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations, which may have a material impact on our result of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance has been recorded to recognize only deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized in the United States federal, state and local tax jurisdictions. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. Certain of our deferred tax assets may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe may also be limited in the portion of NOLs that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act made broad and complex changes to U.S. tax law, including changes to the uses and limitations of NOLs. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its \nability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, including future offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be limited under similar provisions of state and local law. \nWe continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the future. Future adjustments in our valuation allowance may be required, which may have a material impact on our quarterly and annual operating results. \nChanges in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States under federal, state and local jurisdictions in which we operate. The governing tax laws and applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction and are subject to interpretation and macroeconomic, political or other factors. For example, the results of U.S. presidential and congressional elections may lead to tax law changes. We may be subject to examination in the future by federal, state and local authorities on income, employment, sales and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Various tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authorities were to successfully challenge one or more of our tax positions, the results could adversely affect our financial condition. Further, the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be impacted by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions, or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, enacted on August 16, 2022, imposes a one-percent non-deductible excise tax on repurchases of stock that are made by U.S. publicly traded corporations on or after January 1, 2023, which may affect our share repurchase program. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires research and experimental expenditures attributable to research conducted within the United States to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the United States must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. Accordingly, the determination of our overall provision for income and other taxes is inherently uncertain as it requires significant judgment around complex transactions and calculations. As a result, fluctuations in our ultimate tax obligations may differ materially from amounts recorded in our financial statements and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the periods for which such determination is made. \nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, digital services tax, digital advertising tax, business tax, gross receipts tax, and other similar tax to platform and financial technology businesses is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business. In addition, proposed or newly enacted laws regarding indirect tax could increase our compliance obligation. Any failure by us to prepare for and to comply with the reporting and record-keeping obligations could result in penalties and other sanctions, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have faced, and may face in the future, various indirect tax audits in various U.S. jurisdictions. Tax authorities may raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. Although we have reserved for potential payments of \npast tax liabilities on our financial statements, a successful assertion by one or more tax authorities could result in substantial tax liabilities in excess of such reserves as well as penalties and interest, and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future years in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include:\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n•volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of financial technology stocks;\n•general economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, recessions, changes in interest and inflation rates, tightening of credit markets and disruptions in the banking sector;\n•a reduction in the availability of loan funding and liquidity from lending partners and institutional investors;\n•quarterly fluctuations in demand for the loans we facilitate through our marketplace;\n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other financial technology companies and technology companies that offer services to financial institutions;\n•sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders, including sales to cover tax withholding obligations upon vesting of RSUs issued to our employees;\n•issuance of shares of our common stock, whether in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of the outstanding Notes;\n•failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\n•the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n•actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n•fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n•actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n•litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n•compliance with government policies or regulations;\n•the issuance of any cease-and-desist orders from regulatory agencies that we are subject to;\n•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n•market perception of the accuracy of our AI models;\n•actual or perceived data security breaches or other data security incidents;\n•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\n•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n•recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, political unrest, natural disasters, pandemics or responses to these events.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies’ securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, in May 2022, June 2022 and July 2022, we and certain of our officers were sued in purported class action lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our business, operations, and prospects. This litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also affect the trading price of our stock, increase volatility of our stock and diminish our cash reserves.\nAlthough our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The timing and number of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, and general business and market conditions. The program could affect the trading price of our stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. Our Board of Directors will review the program periodically and may authorize adjustments of its terms if appropriate. Any announcement of a suspension or termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.\nThe capped call transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of each of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes may affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of each of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions as counterparties. These capped call transactions are expected generally to offset the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the applicable series of Notes and/or reduce any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Notes, as the case may be, with such offset and/or reduction subject to a cap.\nFrom time to time, the counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable series of Notes (and are likely to do so following May 15, 2026, in the case of the 2026 Notes, and July 1, 2029, in \nthe case of the 2029 Notes, during the observation period for conversions of the applicable series of Notes following any conversion of such Notes prior to May 15, 2026, in the case of the 2026 Notes, and July 1, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, in connection with any repurchase or redemption of the Notes of the applicable series, to the extent we unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions, or if we otherwise unwind all or a portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nCertain insiders have significant voting power, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, officers, and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding capital stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a significant portion of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, are able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions, or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale, and might ultimately affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe large number of shares of our capital stock eligible or registered for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. We have filed and in the future may file registration statements on Form S-8 to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods or vesting conditions and compliance with our Insider Trading Policy, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options and settlement of fully vested RSUs will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock does not provide any rights directly related to the loans we hold.\nInvestors in our common stock own a form of equity that may provide returns based on either an increase in the value of the stock or any distributions made to common stockholders. Investors will not, however, receive any interest in or fees based on the loans or other assets we hold on our balance sheet. In particular, investors in our common stock will not receive any distributions directly based on principal or interest payments made by borrowers on the loans we hold. Those loans are not directly related in any way to the common stock investors’ purchase.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our equity incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue 606,530,279 shares of authorized but unissued common stock and rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We have reserved 7,669,374 shares for issuance under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan subject to adjustment in certain events. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, could dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors in our common stock.\nTransactions relating to our 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2030 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nIf the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes or the 2030 Notes are converted by holders of such series, we are required under the applicable Indenture to pay or deliver, as the case may be, either cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. If we elect to deliver any shares of common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes or the 2030 Notes with respect to our conversion obligation, it would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, certain holders of the 2026 Notes, the 2029 Notes or the 2030 Notes may engage in short selling to hedge their position in the Notes. Anticipated future issuances of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes or 2030 Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nTo the extent a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in connection with any “sell to cover” transactions upon vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) issued to our employees, our stock price may fluctuate. \nUnder U.S. tax laws, employment tax withholding and remittance obligations for RSUs arise in connection with their vesting. To fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the vesting of RSUs, we use the “sell-to-cover” method, under which shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold by a broker on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are subsequently remitted by us to the taxing authorities. The tax withholding due in connection with such RSU vesting is based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our common stock. Such sales do not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs. To the extent a large number of shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n•our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n•vacancies and newly-created seats on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;\n•only the Chair of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our president, or a majority of our entire Board of Directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n•certain litigation against us or our directors, stockholders, officers or employees can only be brought in Delaware;\n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and\n•any amendment of the above anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws will require the approval of at least 66 2/3% of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding shares of our capital stock.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware (or any federal district court, for Securities Act claims) as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over the claims at issue and the indispensable parties; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. We note, however, that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this exclusive forum provision. Further, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court in March 2020, other courts may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable.\nAny person or entity purchasing, holding or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to any causes of action arising under the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal or other courts have exclusive jurisdiction. If a court were to find either of the exclusive-forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur common stock market price and trading volume could decline if equity or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that equity or industry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and \nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our common stock to decline. \nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Our management and other personnel must devote substantial time to these public company requirements that would otherwise be focused on operational and other business matters. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources, and we will need to continue to invest additional resources and incur substantial costs on ongoing compliance burdens, including compliance with new rules and regulations that are adopted from time to time and applicable to us as a public company.\nBeing a public company also makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage, incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or only obtain coverage with a significant deductible. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards or our efforts differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, as well as to fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing corporate debt agreements do, and any future debt agreements may, preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation of our common stock, if any, will be the only way for stockholders to realize any future gains on their investment for the foreseeable future.",
