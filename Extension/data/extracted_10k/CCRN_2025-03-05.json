      "text": "Item 1. Business.\nOverview of Our Company\n\nCross Country Healthcare, Inc. (Nasdaq: CCRN) is a market-leading, tech-enabled workforce solutions and advisory firm with 38 years of industry experience and insight. We help customers tackle complex labor-related challenges and achieve high-quality outcomes, while reducing complexity and improving visibility through data-driven insights.\nLeveraging national and in-market staffing teams, we place highly qualified healthcare professionals in virtually every specialty on travel and per diem assignments, local short-term contracts, and permanent positions. We also place teachers, substitute teachers, and other education specialties at educational facilities, healthcare leaders within nursing, allied, physician, and human resources at healthcare organizations, and non-healthcare providers to participants in Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) programs. Our diverse customer base includes both public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, PACE programs, urgent care centers, local and national healthcare systems, managed care providers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, pharmacies, and many other healthcare providers including those in underserved communities. By utilizing the solutions that we offer, customers are able to better plan their personnel needs, optimize their talent acquisition and management processes, strategically flex and balance their workforce, have access to quality healthcare personnel, and provide continuity of care for improved patient outcomes. We believe that our national footprint provides a unique value proposition, as we are able to engage with a broader pool of talent and offer customers a more consultative approach relying on our understanding of the local and regional markets that they serve.\nWe offer services to our customers through our two reportable segments as described below:\n(1)    Nursing and Allied Staffing. The Nurse and Allied Staffing segment provides traditional staffing, recruiting, and value-added total talent solutions, including: (i) temporary and permanent placement of travel and local nurse and allied professionals, and healthcare leaders within nursing, allied, human resources, and finance; (ii) vendor neutral programs and managed service programs (MSPs); (iii) education healthcare services; (iv) in-home care services; and (v) outsourcing services. We also serve as a direct-hire talent acquisition partner to healthcare organizations and academic institutions throughout the nation, providing a full suite of prescriptive talent management solutions, including flexible talent delivery models such as executive search services for healthcare professionals, as well as contingent search and recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) services. We also offer our Software as a Service (SaaS)-based, proprietary, vendor management technology, Intellify® to facilities to manage all or a portion of their agency services.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from staffing registered nurses and allied professionals on travel contract assignments of varying lengths (typically, 13 weeks) at hospitals and health systems. We staff registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nurse assistants, advanced practitioners, pharmacists, and more than 100 specialties of allied professionals on local per diem and short-term assignments in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. We also provide clinical and non-clinical professionals on long-term assignments to customers such as public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, government facilities, public and charter schools, academic medical centers, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, physician practice groups, local and national healthcare plans, managed care providers, PACE programs, correctional facilities, and many other healthcare providers. We also receive administrative fees from subcontractors at our MSP clients or from those subcontractors who use our Intellify®  technology solution to staff hospital facilities directly.\n(2)    Physician Staffing. Our Physician Staffing segment provides licensed practitioners across a broad array of specialties, as well as certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) on temporary assignments throughout the United States (U.S.). The diverse list of customers we serve includes healthcare facilities, such as acute and non-acute care facilities, medical group practices, government facilities, and managed care organizations. We recruit these professionals nationally and place them on assignments varying in length from several days up to one year. \nOur Nurse and Allied Staffing and Physician Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe healthcare staffing industry continues to evolve, with both healthcare providers and professionals demanding speed and placing heavier reliance on technology for fulfillment and delivery activities. Recognizing this trend, we are continuing on a path of digital transformation and innovation across our business with investments in expanding our technology capabilities both on the customer facing and candidate engagement fronts. We have executed multiple initiatives to enhance our position as a leading, consultative, and strategic partner in the healthcare industry. Some key focus areas include personalizing the candidate experience, delivering a superior customer experience, infusing technology-enablement to drive efficiencies and increased productivity, and continuing our commitment to clinical excellence. As part of our 2024 IT strategy, we continued to invest in technologies for both internal and externally facing systems. In 2023, we released our Internal Resource Pool (IRP) and per diem modules on Intellify®. We expect these initiatives to drive growth through better operational execution, enhanced productivity, and a world-class customer and candidate experience. \nAreas of investment also include recruitment and candidate nurturing tools, market analytics, mobile applications and self-serve capabilities, programmatic advertising, social media, and other technology. These investments enhance our recruiting capabilities and allow us to quickly respond to demand across a wide range of specialties.\nOne of our goals is to grow stockholder value by continuing to deepen our relationships with current customers and healthcare professionals, expanding the number and types of new customers we serve, growing the supply and types of specialties of our healthcare professionals, improving our operating leverage through growth and cost containment, and strengthening and broadening our market presence. This requires our continued focus on: (i) providing workforce solutions offerings to new customers; (ii) expanding the services we provide to current customers, including usage of Intellify®; (iii) further diversifying our customer base; (iv) accessing more candidates; and (v) continuing to modernize technologies and processes to optimize our relationships with healthcare professionals and customers.\nTo successfully execute our business strategy, we rely on experienced and innovative executive and operational teams. Our executive team has extensive experience in staffing, workforce solutions, technology services, and healthcare industries. We also foster a culture of performance, talented leadership, and collegiality that promotes the achievement of both Company and personal goals. With more than 20 healthcare clinicians on our corporate staff, our Clinical Quality Council continues to serve as an advisory committee to our entire organization and customers. In 2022, the Company’s Co-Founder & Chairman was named to the Staffing Industry Analysts’ Staffing 100 List of the most notable leaders in the industry, and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was named to the list in 2023 and 2024. One of our executives was included on Staffing Industry Analysts’ 2024 and 2022 Global Power 150 - Women in Staffing List that recognizes the 100 most influential women in the Americas and 50 additional women internationally, and another executive was included in 2023. Another executive has been recognized as a 2024 and 2023 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Influencer by Staffing Industry Analysts, and one of the 10 Most Influential HR Executives to Watch in 2022 by CIO Views magazine. Our Chairman of the Board of Directors was also nominated as a top staffing leader to watch in 2023 for World Staffing Awards.\nAs previously disclosed, on December 3, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Aya Holdings II Inc., a Delaware corporation (Parent), Spark Merger Sub One Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), and, solely for purposes of Section 11.14 thereto, Aya Healthcare, Inc. (Aya Healthcare), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Aya Merger). On February 20, 2025, the Company and Aya Healthcare each received a request for additional information (Second Request) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the FTC’s review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 until 30 days after both the Company and Aya Healthcare substantially comply with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated earlier by the FTC. The Company expects that the Aya Merger will close in the second half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other customary closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. The Aya Merger was approved by the Company's stockholders at a special meeting held on February 28, 2025. Upon completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Company will become a private company and its common stock will no longer trade on Nasdaq.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nPost-pandemic, there is a need to continue to innovate, improve processes, and expand services to meet the needs of our employees, customers and their patients. During 2024, bill and pay rates adjusted as the impact of the pandemic continued to decline. While we believe that the talent shortage will likely persist into 2025, hospitals are continuing to balance their need for temporary talent with cost containment measures. \nThe market is highly competitive for both clients and candidates, especially within travel nurse and allied, and is growing closer to an inflection point. Our future results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by macroeconomic factors contributing to delays in payments from customers and inflationary pressure, uncertain or reduced demand, and the impact of any initiatives or programs that we may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by our customers.\nAs customers continue to right-size their needs and travel bill rates continue to stabilize across core specialties, we will continue to manage the business for long-term success and strategically position ourselves for future growth opportunities in the market. Regardless of how rates evolve, we are committed to continuing to grow our base of clinicians on assignment and our market share while maintaining the quality that we are known for.\nOur Business Model \nThe recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work temporary assignments on our behalf is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, seeking higher compensation, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position all while practicing in the most appreciated and highly altruistic trade.\n(1)Our Healthcare Professionals.\nNurse and Allied Staffing. Our Company is well positioned to attract candidates, as clinical professionals routinely seek a wide range of diverse assignments in attractive locations, with competitive compensation and benefit packages, scheduling options, as well as a high level of service. We believe nurses and allied professionals are confident that we will be able to offer them new assignments as they complete their current assignment. Each of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is employed by us and is typically paid an hourly wage and receive other benefits they are entitled to receive during the assignment period. Competitive benefits for our employees generally include professional liability and workers compensation insurance, a 401(k) plan, health insurance, reimbursed travel, per diem allowances, and housing. \nRecruiters are an essential element of our Nurse and Allied Staffing business and are responsible for establishing and maintaining key relationships with candidates for the duration of their assignments. Leveraging our database of clinicians, recruiters match the supply of qualified candidates with the demand for open orders from customers. While word-of-mouth and referrals, especially from current and former healthcare professionals we have placed, continue as our leading channel of access to candidates, we also market our brands through strategic sourcing initiatives including programmatic strategic sourcing and extensive utilization of social media and mobile applications, which have become an increasingly important component of our recruitment efforts. In addition to maintaining engaging and intuitive websites to allow potential applicants to obtain information about the Company and assignment opportunities, we \nfurther enhanced Cross Country Marketplace, our proprietary mobile on-demand staffing platform, as a one-stop, self-service portal to support candidates throughout their experience with Cross Country. Our self-service candidate portal, known as XperienceTM, provides our travel and allied healthcare professionals with real-time matching to open positions.\nPhysician Staffing. Cross Country Locums recruits and contracts with physicians and advanced practice professionals to provide medical services for its healthcare customers. We offer a wide variety of assignments, competitive fees, medical malpractice insurance, and a high level of service. Physicians or advanced practice professionals are independent contractors (unless prohibited by applicable law) and enter into agreements with Cross Country Locums to provide medical services at a particular healthcare facility or physician practice group based on terms and conditions specified by that customer, for assignments ranging from a few days up to a year.\n(2)Sales and Marketing. We take an enterprise sales approach by marketing our full capabilities across the continuum of care to hospitals, healthcare facilities, schools, PACE programs, and other organizations across the U.S. addressing total talent management needs. We provide flexible workforce solutions to the healthcare, education, and PACE markets customizing delivery of diversified offerings to meet the specific needs of each customer.\nOur delivery brands include Cross Country Nurses®, Cross Country Allied®, Cross Country Medical Staffing Network®, Cross Country Search®, Cross Country Locums®, Cross Country Workforce Solutions Group®, Cross Country Education®, Intellify® Talent Solutions, and Data Aggregation Services (DAS). Our recruiters leverage the Company’s extensive databases of clinicians and healthcare professionals, as well as their expertise in their given specialties, to qualify and place healthcare candidates.\n(3)Credentialing and Quality Management. We screen all of our healthcare employees prior to placement through our credentialing departments. Our credentialing processes are designed to ensure that professionals have the requisite skill sets required by our customers, as well as the aptitude to meet the day-to-day requirements and challenges they would typically encounter on assignments where they are placed. The credentialing of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is designed to ensure quality of care and align with the guidelines of The Joint Commission, a national accrediting body.\n(4)Billing and Payment for Services. Our shared service center processes hours worked by field employees in various time and attendance systems, which in turn generate billable transactions to our customers. Hours worked by independent contractor physicians are reported to our Cross Country Locums office. Billing for other services such as RPO, Search, or Project Management vary depending on the contract, but typically are invoiced upon the success of achieving agreed upon milestones or completion of specific deliverables, such as the placement of a candidate. On occasion, we are able to bill for the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred, such as candidate marketing costs, or set-up fees incurred for certain projects, such as travel costs for internal staff. \n(5)Operations. Our businesses are operated through a relatively centralized model, servicing all assignment needs of our healthcare professionals, physicians, and customer facilities, as well as support activities, such as coordinating housing, payroll processing, benefits administration, billing and collections, travel reimbursement processing, customer service, and risk management. These activities are performed by a predominantly remote work team, in addition to a few corporate offices.\n(6)Information Systems. Various information systems are utilized to run customer relationship management, recruitment, and placement functions based on our different brands. Some of these sophisticated applications are proprietary and are hosted in Tier 1 hosting facilities while other systems are SaaS-based and hosted by vendor partners. Our systems maintain detailed information about customer-required skill sets and status, which assists us in enabling fulfillment and assignment renewals. Our databases contain an extensive pool of existing and potential customers and all related recruitment and sales activity. Our financial and human resource systems are housed on enterprise resource planning software suites that manage certain aspects of accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, billing, and human capital management. We manage our information systems with internal team members located both in the U.S. and in India. Cybersecurity remains a central focus point across our organization, including dedicated resources, iterative training for all employees, and third parties engaged to assist in monitoring and managing systems and devices, detecting cyber threats, and preventing breaches.\n(7)Risk Management, Insurance, and Benefits. Our risk management program is designed to ensure prompt notification of incidents, educational training to our employees, loss analysis, and timely reporting procedures to reduce our risk of exposure. We continuously review facts and incidents associated with professional liability and \nworkers’ compensation claims in order to identify trends and reduce our risk of loss in the future where possible. We consider assessments provided by our customers, and we work with clinicians and experts from our insurance carriers to determine employment eligibility and potential exposure.\nWe provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, and healthcare benefits for our eligible employed professionals. We record estimates of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers’ compensation and professional liability benefits based on actuarial models prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary using our loss history as well as industry statistics, and include reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. On a quarterly basis, we estimate the healthcare claims that have occurred but have not been reported based on our historical claim submission patterns. The ultimate cost of workers’ compensation, professional liability, and health insurance claims will depend on actual amounts incurred to settle those claims and may differ from the amounts reserved for such claims.\nThe Company maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, workers’ compensation, fidelity, employment practices liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, cyber, property, and professional liability policies. These policies provide coverage for certain liabilities that may arise from our operations, subject to the policy’s terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles. Any of the above policies may not be adequate for our needs, or we may not maintain all such policies in the future.\nServices\nWe are increasingly called upon by our customers to provide creative and innovative talent sourcing strategies across a continuum of care. Over the past several years, our workforce solutions have evolved into a total talent management approach as our customers focus on maintaining high-quality patient outcomes, while improving their total labor management to address complex financial, compliance, and other challenges within the healthcare industry. As part of this total talent management approach, we consider the following: (i) solving the immediate and future needs of our customers; (ii) enhancing our network of healthcare professionals by improving their experience; (iii) expanding service offerings to reduce sensitivity to economic cycles; (iv) expanding our expertise with various healthcare solutions in various geographic areas of the U.S.; (v) continuing to diversify our customer base to enhance long-term business prospects; and (vi) enhancing and expanding technology to deliver efficient and automated services to customer facilities. Our workforce solutions include:\n•MSP. As healthcare providers continue to adopt centralized, outsourced models for managing contingent labor for both clinical and non-clinical needs, we offer an MSP in which we manage all or a portion of the customer’s staffing needs. This includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies. The benefits to our MSP customers include cost optimization, increased certainty of supply, visibility into labor needs and usage, and market insight from our industry expertise on a broad range of topics. We have converted close to 100% of our MSPs onto Intellify®, our SaaS-based, proprietary, vendor-neutral platform that provides analytics and real-time insights, with industry-leading dashboards and reporting.\n•Vendor Neutral Program. We also provide a vendor management system through our Intellify® platform which may also include the placement of our professionals or a menu of various other services. The benefits of our vendor neutral solution include control over the staffing program and suppliers, cost optimization, and visibility into labor needs and usage.\n•In-Home Care Services. Our Workforce Solutions Group division is a premier provider in clinical and non-clinical staffing for home health and senior care facilities, including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs), and PACE centers, allowing aging populations to remain in their homes as long as clinically advisable. We are a full-service partner, with market expertise and a breadth of services, including contingent staffing, consulting, human capital, management solutions, recruitment process outsourcing, vendor management, and direct hiring.\n•Education Healthcare Services. Through Cross Country Education, we focus our knowledge and resources on engaging with and understanding educational organizations, industry trends, and leadership challenges. We provide a wide range of services to our educational partners to meet their individual needs, including special education providers, substitute teachers, behavioral aides, speech language pathologists, and occupational therapists, among others. We also fulfill HR-related tasks, alleviating human resource and administrative paperwork so school administrators can focus on student success.\n•RPO Services. Through our RPO services, we offer targeted recruitment solutions designed to increase core staff while reducing dependency on contract labor. Our RPO program provides support to replace or complement a customer’s existing internal recruitment functions for permanent hiring needs and is delivered to healthcare organizations throughout the country and serves to provide creative, cost and operationally efficient hiring support and labor optimization, which leads to improvements in quality of care.\n•Project Management. Periodically, our customers have urgent needs that fall outside the scope of an MSP arrangement and require a more focused effort to place staff within a very short window. For example, as healthcare systems continue to upgrade their electronic medical records or encounter a labor disruption, we can provide comprehensive project management, deployment of a full staffing plan, and ultimately an organized volume of quality healthcare professionals during the process so that customers may continue to deliver quality care.\n•Executive and Contingent Search. Similar to RPO, we seek to identify and place candidates in full-time roles, across clinical, executive, or administrative functions. These services are offered for specific roles and are contracted on a contingent basis, which has a success fee once placement has occurred.\n•Other Services. We offer other value-added services such as IRP Consulting & Development, Optimal Workforce Solutions (OWS), and DAS. These services seek to augment our customer’s capabilities with managing, supplementing, and outsourcing aspects of their internal processes of managing their workforce. DAS provides healthcare systems with bill rate transparency and can be embedded within Intellify® or offered on a stand-alone basis.\nOur Geographic Markets and Customer Base\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, our revenue was generated primarily in the U.S., and all of our long-lived assets were located in the U.S. and India. We provide our staffing services and workforce solutions in all 50 states. During 2024, the largest percentage of our revenue was concentrated in California, New York, and Florida. We provide services to public and private acute care and non-acute care hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, PACE programs, urgent care centers, public and charter schools, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.\nOur Industry\n\nWe compete in the U.S. temporary healthcare staffing and workforce solutions markets. Staffing Industry Analysts’ September 2024 report estimates the 2024 healthcare staffing markets had an aggregate market size of $45 billion, of which $19.6 billion was travel nursing, $5.4 billion was per diem nursing, $11.1 billion was allied health, and $8.9 billion was locum tenens and advanced practitioners. The demand for our services is impacted by many factors, of which we believe the most significant are the following:\nSupply and Demand Drivers\nHealthcare Backdrop. According to the Staffing Industry Analysts’ “US Staffing Industry Pulse Survey Report” (November 2024), travel nurse staffing was down 21% year-over-year. Median revenue growth was greatest in locum tenens, up 3%. Staffing Industry Analysts’ “US Staffing Industry Forecast: September 2024 Update” (September 11, 2024) forecasts moderate continued expansion in the locum tenens segment, in part as bill rates keep edging up, with a moderate decline in the allied healthcare segment and the per diem nurse segment in 2024, followed by a modest expansion in both segments in 2025. The travel nurse segment is forecasted to normalize back down to pre-pandemic levels in terms of both volume and bill rates. According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics 10-year projections (August 29, 2024), overall, employment is expected to grow 0.4% annually, with the healthcare and social assistance sector having the largest growth in excess of 1.0% annually. Within healthcare, healthcare support occupations and healthcare practitioners and technical occupations are projected to be among the fastest growing of all occupational groups, growing 15.2% and 8.6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2033. Employment growth in the healthcare and social assistance sector is expected to be driven by the aging population and a higher prevalence of chronic conditions.\nSupply of Nurses. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook (August 29, 2024), employment of registered nurses is projected to grow 6%, or 197,200, from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations. The registered nurse workforce is expected to grow from 3.3 million in 2023 to 3.5 million in 2033. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also projects the need for an additional 194,500 new registered nurses each year, on average, through 2033, factoring in nurse retirements and workforce exits. \nPhysician Shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook (August 29, 2024), employment of physicians and surgeons is projected to grow 4% from 2023 to 2033, about as fast as the average for all occupations. About 23,600 openings for physicians and surgeons are projected each year, on average, over the decade. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges’ (AAMC) “Addressing the Physician Workforce Shortage” (March 2024), the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 86,000 by 2036. Population \ngrowth and aging, exacerbated by older physicians who will be retiring soon, serve as the primary drivers of increasing demand for physician services.\nIncreased Need for Healthcare and Special Education Services in Schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistic Report titled “The Condition of Education” (May 30, 2024), during 2022 to 2023, the number of students ages three to twenty-one who received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was 7.5 million, or 15% of all public school students. IDEA requires that these children and young adults receive care from speech language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals while at school.\nMacro Drivers of Demand. The aging U.S. population is creating many challenges regarding elderly healthcare. By 2030, one out of every five U.S. citizens will be of retirement age. Every baby boomer will be 65 or older and the oldest close to 85. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that a person turning 65 today has a 70% chance of requiring long-term care services at some point. As the massive baby boomer generation ages, demand for nursing facilities will continue to climb. According to a survey by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, 87% of nursing homes deal with moderate to high staffing shortages, and 61% limit new admissions due to workforce issues.\nAs an alternative to address these challenges, PACE, a Medicare/Medicaid at-home care program, was created for older adults and people over age 55 living with disabilities. This program provides community-based care and services to people who otherwise would need nursing home levels of care. An Aging in Place study showed that 70% of respondents preferred to age at home. The focus of every PACE organization is to help individuals live in the community for as long as possible. To meet this goal, these organizations focus on preventive care. According to the National PACE Association (NPA), seniors over the age of 65 represent 83% of its members, and 17% of its members are between the ages of 55 and 64. Although all people enrolled in this program are eligible for nursing home care, less than 5% live in nursing homes. On average, states pay PACE programs 12% less than the cost of caring for a comparable population through other Medicaid services, including nursing homes.\nOn January 2, 2025, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act became law, introducing significant enhancements to healthcare services for U.S. veterans. A central component of the legislation is the expansion of access to PACE. The act guarantees that veterans who qualify for healthcare benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and require home and community-based services, including long-term care services and support, can receive these services at home through PACE. Additionally, the initiative aims to expand PACE facilities and services, addressing gaps in care, improving the quality of tailored healthcare for veterans, and reducing avoidable hospitalizations.\nCompetition\nAs one of the largest providers of workforce solutions and healthcare staffing in the U.S., Cross Country operates on a national, regional, and local basis in a highly competitive industry for both healthcare customers and healthcare professionals. In general, we compete against other national companies, as well as numerous smaller, regional, and local companies.\nThe principal competitive factors in attracting, retaining, and expanding business with healthcare customers nationally include: (i) understanding the customer’s environment; (ii) offering a comprehensive suite of services to assist in assessing personnel needs; (iii) partnering with customers to design various customizable alternative solutions; (iv) timely filling of customers’ needs; (v) price; (vi) customer service; (vii) quality assurance and screening capabilities; (viii) risk management policies; (ix) insurance coverage; and (x) general industry reputation.\nThrough our breadth of and expertise in value-added workforce solutions and tech-enabled services, we have the ability to meet a national shift towards a more integrated delivery of healthcare, which allows us to assist hospitals and health systems turning to lower-cost, more accessible alternatives, such as outpatient or ambulatory care centers. In today’s environment, healthcare systems are seeking alternatives to lower costs, with a trend towards vendor neutral and tech-enabled platforms. Our new technology solutions, such as Intellify®, help our customers better manage their spend. By offering travel, per diem, and permanent placement for a variety of healthcare professionals, we are able to present many different types of personnel to hospitals and health systems at their main campuses and their ambulatory and outpatient facilities. \nThe principal competitive factors in attracting qualified healthcare professionals for temporary employment include: (i) a large national pool of desirable assignments; (ii) pay and benefits; (iii) speed of placements; (iv) customer service; (v) quality of \naccommodations; and (vi) overall industry reputation. We focus on retaining healthcare professionals by providing high-quality customer service, long-term benefits (to employees), and medical malpractice insurance.\nFrom a candidate attraction standpoint, we have an extensive customer base with hospitals, healthcare facilities, and other healthcare providers throughout the U.S. As a result, we have a diverse portfolio of assignments for healthcare professionals to choose from. Healthcare professionals apply with us through our differentiated nursing, locum tenens, and allied healthcare recruitment brands. We believe our access to such a large and diverse group of healthcare professionals makes us more attractive to healthcare institutions and facilities seeking healthcare staffing and workforce solutions in the current marketplace. Our applicant tracking system for our travel nurse and allied professionals business provides a world-class candidate experience. Our self-service candidate portal, XperienceTM, provides travel and allied professionals with real-time matching to open positions.\nStaffing Industry Analysts recognized us as a leading healthcare staffing firm in the U.S., with 3.5% market share in 2023. We rank as one of the largest firms in travel nurse staffing, per diem nurse staffing, allied healthcare staffing, and locum tenens. Some of our traditional competitors in the workforce solutions, healthcare staffing, and search businesses include: Aya Healthcare, Medical Solutions, AMN Healthcare Services, CHG Healthcare Services, Amergis, Jackson Healthcare, Ingenovis Health, Hallmark Healthcare Staffing, RightSourcing, American Healthcare Services Association, Favorite Staffing, GHR Healthcare, SimpliFi, and HealthTrust Workforce Solutions (HCA). The market continues to evolve with new competitors entering the industry as barriers to entry are fairly low, especially for other non-clinical staffing companies.\nSeasonality\nThe number of healthcare professionals on assignment with us is subject to seasonal fluctuations which may impact quarterly revenue and earnings. Hospital patient census and staffing needs of hospital and healthcare facilities may fluctuate, for example, during flu season. This seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.\nCertifications\nOur staffing businesses brands are certified by The Joint Commission under its Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program. The Joint Commission is the recognized global leader for healthcare accreditation. Certification promotes a culture of excellence across the organization and is recognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization’s commitment to meeting certain performance standards. Cross Country is the first publicly traded staffing firm to obtain The Joint Commission Certification, which it still holds with a Letter of Distinction. In 2024, the Company was once again certified by The Joint Commission with no deficiencies.\nRegulations\nOur business is subject to regulations by numerous governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate throughout the U.S. Complex federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, and income tax withholdings), state licensing and reporting requirements, privacy, and our general operations, which may be amended from time to time. Future federal and state legislation or interpretations thereof may require us to change our business practices. Compliance with all of these applicable rules and regulations requires a significant amount of resources. We endeavor to be in compliance with all such rules and regulations.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nThe Board of Directors (Board) regularly meets with management to discuss CSR-related topics.\nCSR Overview - 2024 Highlights:\n•We remain steadfast in our commitment to accelerate employability and access to career growth, continue to be a preferred employer, partner with our customers, and drive positive social impacts.\n•Our approach is informed by topics assessed as critical to the business by internal and external stakeholders such as, but not limited to, strong corporate governance, risk oversight and management, business ethics, talent attraction and retention, career development, training and education, safety, health and wellness, technology innovation, and access to quality healthcare. \n•Our Board has full responsibility for risk oversight, which occurs at the full Board level and at committees assigned critical risks.

We have recently been recognized with a Best Company Culture Award™ and Best Company for Diversity Award™, among others, from Comparably, and were named in the 2024 Best Companies to Work For on U.S. News & World Report’s list. Cross Country has received Newsweek Magazine's Most Loved Workplace® certification in 2023 and 2024, along with the Most Loved Workplaces for Wellness 2024. The Newsweek award is supported by research from Best Practice Institute (BPI).\nCorporate Governance. We believe a framework that supports integrity and high ethical standards is key to the long-term success of our business. This framework is the foundation of trust with employees, customers and vendors and is of the utmost importance in all that we do. The Board oversees the Company’s enterprise risk management function to help ensure that communication among the Board, its committees and management on risk, strategic, ESG, cybersecurity, and other matters is open, continuous, and robust.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,400 corporate employees. During 2024, we employed an average of 8,205 full-time equivalent field employees in Nurse and Allied Staffing, which does not include our Physician Staffing independent contractors.\nOur objective is to provide a clean, safe, and healthy workplace for our employees and to help preserve the environment of the communities we serve by monitoring and mitigating any undesired effect of our business activities on the environment. We’ve embraced an ongoing effort aimed at reducing our use of finite resources, including our paper shredding and recycling programs.\nOur goal is to provide work conditions that enable employees to thrive in an environment that is healthy and reduces hazards and health and safety issues, as well as raising awareness on health and safety risks related to our business activities. We believe this drives employee retention and performance, thus allowing us to retain a healthy productive team. As part of our health and safety program, we partner with employees to help them maintain both their physical and mental welfare by providing education on health topics, facilitating complementary health screenings, and offering resources that include a confidential support line. Our culture is infused with a growth mindset that encourages employee internal progression and retention through an array of learning and coaching resources. Employees are held to the ethics standards set forth in our Code of Ethics policy, which also applies to vendors and suppliers. We aim to foster a sound, respectful, fair, and inclusive workplace and condemn all forms of unlawful and inappropriate conduct, such as violence, discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and any behavior that creates a hostile or coercive work environment. In 2024, Cross Country Healthcare was awarded Newsweek Magazine’s Most Loved Workplace® certification for a second year and named in the Best Companies to Work for - South 2024-2025 List by U.S. News & World Report.\nOur ability to be successful in our marketplace directly depends on attracting and retaining talented and skilled employees, and keeping those individuals fully engaged in our business. Through our adoption of a Human Rights and Labor Rights Policy guided by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles, our goal is to help increase the enjoyment of human rights within the communities in which we operate. This policy sets forth our intolerance of discrimination and harassment, our employees’ freedom of association, and the importance we place on the safety and health of our employees.\nCompensation and Benefits. We are committed to rewarding, supporting, and developing the associates who make it possible to deliver on our strategy. To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at the varying health, home-life, and financial needs of our diverse corporate associates. Our total corporate rewards package includes market-competitive pay, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, various discount programs, and tuition assistance.\nHealth and Wellness. We are committed to the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees. Among other things, we are primarily a remote workforce. We also provide free biometric healthcare screenings, a 24/7 hotline for healthcare workers who are experiencing emotional stress, and incentives to employees who achieve specific fitness goals through our “Burnalong” wellness challenge. Our wellness activity calendar features weekly and monthly events and educational sessions to help employees reach and maintain their health and wellness goals. Monthly well-being newsletters focus on physical, mental, and financial wellness topics of interest. We also mark one or more health observances every month, such as heart health, high blood pressure awareness, men’s health, children’s dental health, and more, which provide additional resources for employees to educate themselves and their families. We believe the health and well-being of our employees has a direct impact on the quality of the services they deliver, and we continue to support them through providing the Compassion Fund for corporate employees suffering financial hardships, offering a paid volunteer day off for corporate employees to serve our communities, providing a psychologist and group therapy as needed, and providing a SaaS-based platform to all of our employees, and up to four family members, for free so they can stay connected through a universe of classes (e.g., yoga, language, psychology, and many others).\nTalent Development. Our mission regarding talent management and development is to support organizational results and success by employing strategies to attract, engage, develop, and retain employees, and to partner with our leaders to nurture and grow leadership talent. These investments include providing clear insight into employee performance, creating career paths, promoting from within whenever possible, maintaining open communication, and offering professional development opportunities. We employ Dayforce, a human resources system which features a fully interactive learning management module, where employees can access professional development resources, such as skills training courses. We offer Career Pathing, a system that allows employees to create a path to help guide their career development and growth within the Company. We partner with Strayer University, Excelsior University, and Capella University to provide our employees with access to flexible degree programs at a discounted cost. In 2023, we launched an enterprise mentorship program and a new career pathing program called Cross Country University. Through our annual Innovation Challenge, employees voice original ideas to improve our operations with the chance to win a monetary award. We have also embraced the Nursing Now pledge by reinforcing investment in the workforce, continuing to promote nurses to management roles, and providing guidance and support on best nursing practices through our dedicated clinical team. Nursing Now is a global campaign aimed at improving health by raising the status and profile of nursing.\nCommunity and Social Impact. We participate in numerous events with a variety of non-profit organizations. Our mission to deliver quality patient care extends to our community and we are committed to action that fosters positive impact in our community and around the U.S. Our human resources department develops and implements programs to help our employees realize their potential through volunteering and supporting our communities. Employees are able to take paid time off to perform volunteer activities, and are able to donate to certain charities directly from their pay, either as a one-time or ongoing donation.\nAdditional Information\nFinancial reports and filings with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC, on or through our corporate website at www.crosscountry.com.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors. \nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements we make about our business. Our risks are identified primarily through dialogue with our leaders, including a formal Enterprise Risk assessment, industry trends, our experience, and consideration of the current external market and financial environment. These risk factors are considered in our overall strategy and execution of operations. Factors we currently consider immaterial and factors we currently do not know may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated results, financial condition, or cash flows. \nBusiness, Economic, and Industry Risks\nOur operations and financial results may be affected by pandemics, epidemics, or other public health crises.\nDuring a pandemic, epidemic, or other public health crisis, certain of our healthcare professionals may be exposed to disease, diagnosed with an illness and/or quarantined as a result of illness. Healthcare workers can become burned out from the emotional and physical stress of a prolonged pandemic, which may result in shortage of supply if core staff members leave their jobs. If, as a result of such risks, our healthcare professionals do not want to, or are not able to provide services, it could negatively impact our supply and ability to provide staffing services to our customers. In addition, census at healthcare facilities continues to vary for many reasons. All of these effects can result in reduced demand for our services or the cancellation of our healthcare professionals working at those facilities or under contract to provide services at those facilities in the future. These effects may also create specific demand in certain specialties and in specific regions of the country.\nThe financial impact to our healthcare customers from any pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis may also impact their ability to pay for our services timely or altogether, including invoices for services provided prior to such an event that were in process. Such a failure to pay for our services timely or altogether would have an impact on our collections, resulting in a negative financial impact on our Company.\nGlobal economic conditions and the effect of economic pressures could lead to decreases in demand or pricing for our services, which would adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nUncertainties in global economic conditions that are beyond our control have in the past impacted our business and may in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. These adverse economic conditions include economic downturns, inflation, recession, slow recovery or growth, new or increased tariffs and other taxes, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, high unemployment, decreased consumer confidence in the economy, armed hostilities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, conditions affecting the market for temporary staffing services, and other unexpected events, including public health crises.\nA decrease or stagnation in the general level of in-patient admissions, out-patient services, or government reimbursements at or to our customers’ facilities could lead to decreases in demand or pricing for our services. When a hospital’s admissions increase, temporary employees or other healthcare professionals are often added before full-time employees are hired. As admissions decrease, customers typically reduce their use of temporary employees or other healthcare professionals before undertaking layoffs of their permanent employees. In periods of economic downturn or high inflation, permanent healthcare staff generally work more hours, resulting in fewer vacancies and less demand for our services. Decreases in demand or pricing for our services may also affect our ability to provide attractive assignments to our healthcare professionals. Any substantial economic downturn, including significant inflationary pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe may face challenges competing in the marketplace if we are unable to anticipate and quickly respond to changing marketplace conditions, such as alternative modes of healthcare delivery, reimbursement, and customer needs.\nPatient delivery settings continue to evolve, including potential changes related to artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to alternative modes of healthcare delivery, such as retail medicine, telemedicine, and home health. Our success is dependent upon our ability to develop innovative workforce solutions and quickly adapt to changing marketplace conditions and client needs, including making modifications to our technologies and evolving our technology platform, which may differentiate our services and abilities from those of our competitors. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging customer needs and marketplace conditions. Uncertainty regarding or changes to federal healthcare law and the willingness of our hospital, healthcare facilities and physician group customers to develop their own temporary staffing pools, replace core staff who have resigned or retired, or to increase the productivity of their permanent staff may, individually or in the aggregate, significantly affect demand for our temporary healthcare staffing services and may hamper our ability to attract, develop, and retain customers. In addition, if hospitals continue to consolidate in an effort to \nenhance their market positions, improve operational efficiency, hire permanent replacements to replace core staff, and create organizations capable of managing population health, demand for our services could decrease. The staffing industry has experienced a marked decline in revenue in the post-COVID era in light of shifting customer needs.\nThe development of new service lines and business models using advanced technology solutions, including but not limited to AI, requires us to be at the forefront of emerging trends in the healthcare industry. We may face challenges competing in the marketplace if we are unable to quickly adapt our business model and successfully implement innovative services and solutions to address these changes. \nMarket disruptions or downturns may adversely affect our, or our customer’s, operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic conditions and volatility in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to us and to our customers and businesses generally. Conditions in the credit markets and the economy generally could adversely impact our business and limit or prohibit us from refinancing our credit agreements on terms favorable to us or at all when they become due. To the extent that disruption in the financial markets occurs, it has the potential to materially affect our and our customers’ ability to tap into debt and/or equity markets to continue ongoing operations, have access to cash, and/or pay debts as they come due. Although we monitor our credit risks to specific customers that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk or lack of access to liquidity may result from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee and this could have a material negative impact to our financial results.\nWe are subject to business and regulatory risks associated with international operations.\nWe have international operations in India where our Cross Country Infotech, Pvt Ltd. (Infotech) subsidiary is located. Infotech provides in-house information systems development and support services, as well as some back-office processing services. We have limited experience in supporting our services outside of North America. Operations in certain markets are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including: (i) fluctuations in currency exchange rates; (ii) changes in regulations; (iii) varying economic and political conditions; (iv) overlapping or differing tax structures; (v) regulations (pertaining to, among other things, compensation and benefits, vacation, and the termination of employment); and (vi) privacy and security issues. Our inability to effectively manage our international operations, the security and/or privacy of the systems we use internationally, or our violation of any regulation could result in increased costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by the loss of key management or corporate employee turnover.\nWe believe the successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to build upon significant recent investments and acquisitions depends on the continued employment of key members of our management team and corporate employees. If we were to lose any key personnel, we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur customers may terminate or not renew their contracts with us.\nOur arrangements with hospitals, healthcare facilities, physician group, PACE, and education customers are generally terminable by the customer upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. These customers are focused on cost-saving measures and, more recently, the number of request for proposal (RFPs) appears to have increased. As a result, we may lose customers if our customers issue RFPs and choose to contract with one of our competitors instead of us. We may have fixed costs, such as housing costs, associated with terminated arrangements that we will be obligated to pay post-termination, thus negatively impacting our profitability. In addition, the loss of one or more of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nIf our healthcare facility customers increase the use of intermediary organizations, it could impact our profitability and our ability to secure contracts with customers.\nWe continue to see our customers use intermediary organizations and an increase in the use of side-by-side managed service providers. Intermediaries typically enter into contracts with hospitals or health systems and then subcontract with us and other agencies to provide staffing services, thus interfering to some extent in our relationship with our customers. Each of these intermediaries charges an administrative fee. In instances where we do not win new MSP opportunities or where other vendors win this MSP, a side-by-side MSP opportunity, or vendor management system (VMS) business with our current customers, the number of professionals we have on assignment at those customers and/or our spend under management could decrease. If we are unable to negotiate hourly rates with intermediaries for the services we provide to these customers which are sufficient to cover administrative fees charged by those intermediaries, it could impact our profitability. If hospitals fail to pay the intermediaries for our services or those intermediaries become insolvent or fail to pay us for our services, it could impact \nour bad debt expense and thus our overall profitability. We also provide comprehensive MSP and other workforce solutions directly to certain of our customers. While such contracts typically improve our market share at these facilities, they could result in less diversification of our customer base, increased liability, and reduced margins.\nOur costs of providing services may rise faster than we are able to adjust our bill rates and pay rates and, as a result, our margins could decline and our profitability could be adversely impacted.\nCosts of providing our services and regulatory changes to required wages could change more quickly than we are able to renegotiate bill rates in our active customer contracts and pay rates with our thousands of healthcare professionals. For example, we offer housing subsidies to some of our healthcare professionals or directly provide housing to other healthcare professionals. The cost of subsidizing housing or renting apartments and furniture for these healthcare professionals may increase faster than we are able to renegotiate our rates with our customers, and this may have a negative impact on our profitability. In addition, an increase in other incremental costs beyond our control, such as insurance, could negatively affect our financial results. The costs related to obtaining and maintaining professional and general liability insurance, health insurance, and workers’ compensation insurance for healthcare providers has generally been increasing. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition unless we are able to pass these costs through to our customers or renegotiate pay rates with our healthcare providers.\nOperational Risks\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems and applications hosted by our vendors, and our inability to implement new technology systems and infrastructure could cause disruptions to our ability to operate effectively.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of information systems used to operate our business, including those applications hosted by our vendors. Critical information systems used in daily operations identify and match staffing resources and customer assignments and perform billing and accounts receivable functions. Additionally, we rely on our information systems in managing our accounting and financial reporting. These systems are subject to certain risks, including technological obsolescence. We continue to evaluate the technology platforms of our businesses. If our proprietary systems of SaaS applications fail, are not successfully implemented, or are otherwise unable to function in a manner that properly supports our business operations, or if these systems require significant costs to repair, maintain, or further develop or update, we could experience business interruptions or delays that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, our information systems are protected through a secure hosting facility and additional backup remote processing capabilities also exist in the event our primary systems fail or are not accessible. However, our business is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and other events which may prevent personnel from gaining access to systems necessary to perform their tasks in an automated fashion. In the event that critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, these functions would have to be accomplished manually, which could impact our ability to, among other things, maintain billing and clinical records reliably, bill for services efficiently, and maintain our accounting and financial reporting accurately.\nCompany and third-party computer, technology and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access, and disruption that could expose the Company to material operational, financial, and reputational damage (including the unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal and confidential information). \nThe Company’s ability to manage its operations in both the U.S. and India through the use of key systems successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer, technology and communications systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary systems (and, as a result, its operations) are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, technology and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events, and errors in usage by the Company’s or its vendors’ employees and contractors. In addition, the Company’s systems contain personal and confidential information, including information of importance to the Company, and its employees, vendors, contractors, and customers.\nCyberattacks, including attacks motivated by the desire for monetary gain, geopolitics, grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems or the systems of its vendors or customers, or allow unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal or confidential information, including information about employees, vendors, candidates, contractors and customers. The Company’s security tools, controls and practices, including those relating to identity and access management, credential strength, and the security tools, controls and practices of its vendors and customers, may not prevent access, damage or disruption to Company or third-party systems or the unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal or confidential information. There are many approaches through which such systems could be damaged or disrupted, or information exposed or accessed, including through system vulnerabilities, improperly obtaining and using user credentials, or the misuse of authorized user access. \nThe damage or disruption to Company or third-party systems, or unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal or confidential information, could harm the Company’s operations, reputation and brand, resulting in a loss of business or revenue. It could also subject the Company to government sanctions, litigation from candidates, contractors, customers, and employees, and legal liability under its contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The Company may also incur additional expenses, such as the cost of remediating incidents or improving security measures, the cost of identifying and retaining replacement vendors, increased costs of insurance, or ransomware payments.\nCybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. Furthermore, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings. Any future events impacting the Company or its third-party vendors that damages or interrupts the Company's or its third-party vendors’ systems or exposes data or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation, and financial results.\nChanges in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information (and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations) could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations, financial results, and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its customers, employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transfers, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. \nFor example, there has been a number of recently enacted state-level privacy regulations that assign specific rights to consumers, employees, and other data subjects, and imposes specific operational requirements for businesses that collect, process, and store personal information. Complying with these enhanced obligations, state-level privacy regulations (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)) and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection have increased, and continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention. Simultaneously, any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, consumer actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial results and reputation.\nSocial, ethical, and security issues relating to the use of AI may result in reputational harm and liability.\nMany of our business operations and support activities are performed by a predominantly remote workforce. Should any of these employees utilize non-approved AI, this could result in reputational harm to the Company and have an adverse effect on its operations. In addition, we may incorporate traditional and generative AI solutions into our information systems and products which may become important in our operations over time. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including AI, creates opportunities for the potential loss or misuse of personal data that we collected or used to run our business. There is also a risk that we may not have access to the technology and qualified AI personnel resources to adequately incorporate advancements into our AI initiatives. The rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulations, will require significant resources to develop, test and maintain our platforms to help us implement AI responsibly. This may result in significantly increased business and security costs, administrative penalties, or costs related to defending legal claims.\nWe may be unable to recruit and retain enough quality professionals to meet our customers’ demands.\nWe rely significantly on our ability to attract, develop, and retain professionals who possess the skills, experience and, as required, licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our customers. We compete for healthcare and other staffing personnel with other temporary staffing companies, as well as actual and potential customers such as healthcare facilities and physician groups, some of which seek to fill positions with either permanent or temporary employees. We rely on word-of-mouth referrals, as well as social and digital media, to attract qualified professionals. If our social and digital media strategy is not successful, our ability to attract qualified professionals could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, with a shortage of certain qualified professionals in many areas of the United States, competition for these professionals remains intense. Our ability to recruit and retain professionals depends on our ability to, among other things, offer assignments that are attractive to professionals and offer them competitive wages and benefits or payments, as applicable. Our competitors might increase hourly wages or the value of benefits to induce professionals to take assignments with them. If we do not raise wages or increase the value of benefits in response to such increases by our competitors, we could face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified professionals. If we raise wages or increase benefits in response to our competitors’ increases, \nour customers and our margins could decline. At this time, we still do not have enough nurses, allied professionals, and physicians to meet all of our customers’ demands for these staffing services. A shortage of healthcare professionals generally and the competition for their services may limit our ability to increase the number of healthcare professionals that we successfully recruit, decreasing our ability to grow our business.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by a shortage of experienced healthcare professionals and labor union activity.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to recruit and staff quality healthcare professionals. We compete with other staffing companies and technologies in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to our employees through mandatory minimum wage laws, which could negatively impact our profitability. Labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. In the event we are not entirely effective at recruiting and retaining qualified management, nurses, and other support personnel, or in controlling labor costs, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the execution of certain critical functions.\nWe have outsourced certain critical applications or business processes to external providers, including, but not limited to, background screenings of our employees. We exercise care in the selection and oversight of these providers. However, the failure or inability of one or more of these critical suppliers to perform could cause significant disruptions and increased costs to our business. In addition, we rely on third-party timekeeping systems in certain circumstances to process payroll. To the extent that these payroll systems experience a disruption or delay in reporting time worked by our healthcare professionals, we may not be able to make payroll to our healthcare workers timely. This could result in significant dissatisfaction by our healthcare workers and damage to our reputation, in addition to violations of certain laws or regulations. We have a risk mitigation plan in place in the event this were to occur, but the inability to effectively implement this plan, or its failure, could cause an adverse impact to our business and our financials.\nAs the use of social media platforms expands, new risks and challenges may cause damage to our brand and reputation.\nIn our industry, the use of social media platforms has increased due to the ability to access to a broad audience through social media websites and other internet communication. Any inappropriate or unauthorized use of certain social media vehicles by our employees, contractors, customers, or vendors could cause damage to our brand, or result in information leakage that could have legal implications, including the dissemination of personally identifiable information of customers or employees. In addition, inaccurate posts or comments on social media websites could damage our reputation or brand image.\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that our industry reputation is critical to our success. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation directly relates to our ability to hire and retain healthcare professionals. Any negative claims or publicity about us, including through social media, may adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, and retain qualified healthcare professionals, and may also adversely affect relationships with our customers. In this regard, failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting, or environmental standards could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse effects on our business. \nThe strength of our reputation may also depend on the success of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. Risks associated with these initiatives include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, new laws and regulations, increased costs associated with sustainability efforts and/or compliance with laws and regulations, as well as increased pressure to expand our CSR and sustainability disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals, and take actions to meet such targets and goals. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to CSR or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable CSR or ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on the price of our securities and our access to and costs of capital.\nAll of the foregoing could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. Any CSR or sustainability metrics that we currently or may in the future disclose, whether based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others, may influence our reputation and the value of our brands. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other \nstakeholders, on CSR and other sustainability matters, including the use of energy and waste. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not, or are perceived to not, act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nLegal, Tax, and Regulatory Risks\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Any material changes in the political, economic, or regulatory environment that affect the purchasing policies, practices, and operations of healthcare organizations, or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry, could reduce the funds available to purchase our services or otherwise require us to modify our offerings.\nWe provide our services to hospitals and health systems which pay us directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact us. However, indirectly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally, and hospitals and health systems particularly. The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing political, economic, and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation, and general economic conditions could affect the purchasing practices, operations and financial health of our customers, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, application and interpretation of laws sometimes change and those changes may spark regulatory inquiries or investigations as a result, for which we may not be insured and which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Insurance companies and managed care organizations also seek to control costs by requiring healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. While not affecting us directly, future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce or change conditions for our customers’ reimbursement. Such limitations on reimbursement could reduce our customers’ cash flows, hampering the prices we can charge customers, and reducing their ability to pay us. Reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for our services. The impact of any legislation to repeal, amend, or replace the Affordable Care Act could also adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate our business in a regulated industry and modifications, inaccurate interpretations, or violations of any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements may result in material costs or penalties, as well as litigation, and could reduce our revenue and earnings per share.\nOur industry is subject to many complex federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations related to, among other things, the licensure of professionals, medical malpractice claims and related indemnity claims, the payment of our field employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes, arbitration agreements, and income tax withholdings), expense reimbursements, wage transparency, and the operations of our business generally (e.g., federal, state, and local tax laws). If we do not comply with the laws and regulations that are applicable to our business, we could incur civil and/or criminal penalties or become subject to litigation or equitable remedies. We maintain insurance coverage for employment claims; however, it may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. If our insurance does not cover the particular claim or if we are unable to pay our self-insured retention portion, pay any uninsured portion, or maintain adequate insurance coverage, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities that would materially impact our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to various litigation, claims, investigations, and other proceedings which could result in substantial judgments, settlement costs, or uninsured liabilities.\nWe are party to various litigation, claims, investigations, and other proceedings. These matters primarily relate to employee-related matters that include individual and collective claims, professional liability, tax, and payroll and/or related practices. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Additionally, as a result of the economy and changes to the law, increased collective bargaining actions, healthcare professionals no longer being able to secure the same level of income as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors, the number of litigation claims have increased in both volume and financial recovery. Based on assessments and estimates, if any, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments are performed at least quarterly and are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Based on the new information considered in our reviews, we adjust our disclosures and our loss contingency accruals, which may increase as a result of increased litigation claims. We may not have sufficient insurance to cover these risks. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those estimated by our current assessments, which would impact our profitability. Adverse developments in existing litigation claims or legal proceedings involving our Company or new claims could require us to establish or increase litigation \nreserves or enter into unfavorable settlements or satisfy judgments for monetary damages for amounts in excess of current reserves, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn recent years, healthcare providers and the Company have become subject to or brought an increasing number of legal actions alleging, among other things, malpractice, vicarious liability, violation of certain consumer protection acts, negligent hiring, negligent credentialing, discrimination, wage and hour, or related legal theories. We may be subject to liability in such cases even if our Company’s contribution to the alleged injury was minimal or related to one of our subcontractors or its employees. Many of these actions, including class actions, involve large claims and significant defense costs. In addition, we may be subject to claims related to torts or crimes committed by our corporate employees or healthcare professionals that we place on assignment. In most instances, we are required to indemnify customers against some or all of these risks, and, at times, liabilities attributable to our subcontractors and their personnel, and the law may consider the Company and its customers to be joint employers, adding further complexities to litigation. A failure of any of our corporate employees, healthcare professionals, or subcontracted personnel to observe our policies and guidelines, relevant customer policies and guidelines, or applicable federal, state, or local laws, rules, and regulations could result in negative publicity, payment of fines, or other damages to us.\nTo protect ourselves from the cost of these types of claims, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance, employment practices liability insurance, and general liability insurance coverage with terms and in amounts with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations, although we do not maintain insurance coverage for wage and hour claims or for liabilities of our subcontractors or their personnel. We are partially self-insured for our workers’ compensation coverage, health insurance coverage, and professional liability coverage for our healthcare providers. If we become subject to substantial uninsured workers’ compensation, wage and hour claims, medical coverage, or medical malpractice liabilities, whether directly or indirectly, our financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. If we are unable to pay our self-insured retention portion, pay any uninsured portion, or maintain adequate insurance coverage, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities.\nIf applicable government regulations change, we may face increased costs that reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe temporary healthcare staffing industry is regulated in many states. For example, in some states, firms such as our nurse staffing companies must be registered to establish and advertise as a nurse-staffing agency or must qualify for an exemption from registration in those states. Several states have adopted wage transparency or equity laws that have complex reporting requirements. If we were to lose any required state licenses, we could be required to cease operating in those states. The introduction of new regulatory provisions could also substantially raise the costs associated with hiring temporary employees. For example, some states could impose sales taxes or increase sales tax rates on temporary healthcare staffing services. These increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers. In addition, if government regulations were implemented that limited the amount we could charge for our services, our profitability could be adversely affected. We continuously monitor changes in regulations and legislation for potential impacts on our business.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, if there are further legislative tax changes, or if we are unable to utilize our net operating losses (NOLs).\nWe are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business. We also have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs in state taxing jurisdictions, which, generally, for state tax purposes, carry forward for up to twenty years or indefinitely, depending on the year the NOL was generated. Tax years generally remain subject to examination until three years after NOLs are used or expire. We expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority. We believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a taxing authority. If there are tax benefits, including, but not limited to, the use of NOLs, expense reimbursements, or other tax attributes, that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority, we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities, which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. On March 27, 2020, former President Biden signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law, which was extended under the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 passed on December 27, 2020. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). We are not aware of any provision in the CARES Act, ARPA, or any other pending tax legislation that would have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. There can be no assurance that the CARES Act, ARPA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of \n2017, or any other legislative changes will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations. \nLastly, we may be limited in our ability to utilize our remaining state NOLs to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is also dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our state NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our state NOLs, we could be required to record additional valuation allowances. We review the valuation allowances for our state NOLs periodically and make adjustments from time to time, which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our state NOLs. If we are unable to use our state NOLs or use of our state NOLs is limited, we may have to make significant payments or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf certain of our healthcare professionals are reclassified from independent contractors to employees, our profitability could be materially adversely impacted.\nFederal or state taxing authorities could re-classify our locum tenens physicians, CRNAs, nurse practitioners, and other independent contractors as employees, despite both the general industry standard to treat them as independent contractors and many state laws prohibiting non-physician owned companies from employing physicians (e.g., the “corporate practice of medicine”). Other than in California and Illinois, where advanced practitioners are required to be classified as W-2 employees by law, if they were re-classified as employees, we would be subject to, among other things, employment and payroll-related tax claims, as well as any applicable penalties and interest. Any such reclassification would have a material adverse impact on our business model for that business segment and would negatively impact our profitability.\nIf the method for paying locum tenens physicians changes, it could negatively impact our profitability.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 created a certain framework for rewarding physicians for providing higher quality care by establishing two tracks of payment: a merit-based incentive payment system and Advanced Alternative Payment Models. If hospitals change the method for paying locum tenens physicians to meet their performance goals or other criteria for Medicaid or Medicare reimbursements, the profitability of our business could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe could have a level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic, or financing opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings under our Asset-Based Loan Agreement (ABL). A change in our level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences including: (i) increased demands on our cash resources to service the debt; (ii) our financial and operating flexibility may be restricted due to debt covenants to which we are subject, and our ability to generate profitability and maintain cash flow from operations could impact our compliance with these covenants; and (iii) we may choose to institute self-imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage, and our strategic plans. For example, as a result of our level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the U.S. economy:\n-    we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n-    we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our cash flows;\n-    we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements that would be in our long-term interests;\n-    we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments;\n-    we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;\n-    we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged;\n-    we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations; and\n- we may not be able to successfully raise capital to execute our mergers and acquisitions strategy.\nThese constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs and/or fail to satisfy the financial and other covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness, which could adversely affect long term growth and results of operations.\nWe currently have sufficient liquidity to operate our business in the normal course. If, however, we were to close an acquisition or enter into a similar type of transaction, our liquidity needs may exceed our current capacity. Our credit facility currently contains an occurrence-based financial covenant that may be triggered if we fall below a certain level of excess availability, requiring us to operate above a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Additionally, our borrowing capacity is based on trade receivables and we could have a loss in availability due to market or other financial conditions affecting our customers and their ability to pay according to terms, resulting in ineligible receivables (to borrow against). Deterioration in our operating results could result in our inability to comply with this covenant and would result in a default under our credit facility. If an event of default exists, our lenders could call the indebtedness and we may be unable to renegotiate or secure other financing.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe may face difficulties integrating our acquisitions into our operations and our acquisitions may be unsuccessful, involve significant cash expenditures, or expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe continually evaluate opportunities to acquire companies that would complement or enhance our business. These acquisition opportunities involve numerous risks, including potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies; difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into our business; difficulties integrating acquired companies into our operating, financial planning, and financial reporting systems; diversion of management attention from existing operations; and assumptions of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for their failure to comply with healthcare and tax regulations. These acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence and integration expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nNotwithstanding the due diligence investigation we perform in connection with acquisitions, the acquired business may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection.\nWhile we perform significant due diligence prior to signing purchase agreements, we are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the sellers and their representatives when conducting due diligence and evaluating the results of such due diligence. We do not control and may be unaware of activities of the sellers before the acquisition, including intellectual property disputes and other litigation or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, policies, rules, and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other liabilities.\nThe sellers’ obligations to indemnify us is limited to, among others, breaches of specified representations and warranties and covenants included in the purchase agreement and other specific indemnities as set forth in the purchase agreement. In the event of a breach of a representation or warranty, other than a core representation (as defined in the purchase agreement), sellers’ obligation to indemnify us may be limited to the time frame in which the loss arises and the amount of the loss. If any issues arise post-closing, we may not be entitled to, or be able to, collect sufficient, or any, indemnification or recourse from the sellers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nLosses caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes and fires, the physical effects of climate change, or other unexpected events, could cause us to suffer material financial losses.\nCatastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, fires, and other severe weather. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, certain regions where we operate could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, wildfires, rising sea-levels and/or drought. With our headquarters, shared services, and many of our remote workers located in South Florida, we are more vulnerable to possible disruptions from hurricanes and the impacts resulting therefrom, such as tornadoes, flooding, fuel shortages, and disruption of internet and telecommunications services. We also have a significant amount of business and employees in California, which is vulnerable to wildfires and earthquakes. Over time, these conditions could result in increases in our operating costs or business interruptions. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure and the severity of the event. We do not maintain business interruption insurance for these events. We could suffer material financial losses as a result of disruptions from hurricanes, fires, or other catastrophes, including unexpected events.\nLocations operated by our vendors may also be subject to natural disasters or other extreme weather conditions. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could result in significant operational changes and expenditures and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in global temperatures, weather patterns, negative global climate change patterns, and increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in both the U.S. and India locations could have a negative effect on the Company’s business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation, and utility increases and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Moreover, continuing political and social attention to climate change and environmental issues has resulted in both existing and pending disclosure requirements, international agreements and national, regional, and local legislation, regulatory measures, reporting obligations, and policy changes. There is increasing pressure in some of the areas where we operate to limit greenhouse gas emissions as well as other global initiatives. These agreements and measures may require or could result in future legislation, regulatory measures, or policy changes that would require operational changes, taxes, or purchases of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures.\nDue to inherent limitations, our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures may not be successful in preventing all errors and fraud, or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of an individual, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nImpairment in the value of our goodwill, trade names, or other intangible assets could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share.\nWe are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives (such as trade names) annually, to determine if impairment has occurred. Long-lived assets and other identifiable intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that amounts may not be recoverable. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry, or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition, or changes in our stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, could affect the fair value of goodwill, trade names, or other intangible assets, which may result in an impairment charge. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on us.\nIf provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law delay or prevent a change in control, we may be unable to consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. Without stockholder approval, the Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Delaware law may also discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.\nStock is issuable under our stock incentive plan and sales of this stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have registered 2,400,000 shares (in addition to the share reserve amount that remained available under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan immediately prior to the adoption of the 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2024 Plan) and other eligible returning shares) for issuance under our 2024 Plan. Shares of restricted stock outstanding as of February 18, 2025 were 535,185. In addition, a target of 409,698 performance stock award grants were outstanding as of February 18, 2025. See Note 14 - Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Vested restricted stock and common stock issued under our awards is eligible for resale in the public market without restriction. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of shares held by any stockholder or the availability of these shares for future sale will have on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Aya Merger\nThere are risks inherent in any transaction that we enter into, including without limitation the Aya Merger, and there is no assurance that such transaction will be successfully or timely completed or that we will realize the expected benefits of such transaction.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on December 3, 2024, the Company signed the Merger Agreement, which provides for the consummation of the Aya Merger. The consummation of the Aya Merger is subject to certain customary mutual conditions, including, without limitation, (i) the approval of the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, voting together as a single class, which such stockholder approval was received at the special meeting held on February 28, 2025 (Company Stockholder Approval), (ii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority prohibiting, rendering illegal or permanently enjoining the consummation of the Aya Merger (Legal Restraint), and (iii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (or extensions thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Aya Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and any commitment to, or agreement (including any timing agreement) with, any governmental authority to delay or not consummate before a certain date the Aya Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (Applicable Waiting Period and Approvals and, together with the Company Stockholder Approval and the Legal Restraint, these Certain Closing Conditions). If we are unable to timely satisfy these Certain Closing Conditions and/or any other conditions required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Aya Merger may be delayed and/or may not occur at all. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to pay to Parent a one-time fee equal to $20 million (Company Termination Fee) if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent for certain reasons set forth in the Merger Agreement. If we are unable to successfully and timely consummate the Aya Merger and/or if we are required to pay the Company Termination Fee, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Even if we are able to successfully and timely consummate the Aya Merger, there is no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of such transaction.\nIn addition to the foregoing risks relating to our ability to successfully and timely complete the Aya Merger, any transaction that we enter into requires substantial resources, as well as the time and attention of our management team. Accordingly, the diversion of resources and management time on transaction-related issues and risks related to the disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the Aya Merger could have an adverse effect on us. The announcement and pending completion of the Aya Merger could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and/or on our ability to retain customers and key personnel and maintain relationships with our third-party business partners. The Aya Merger could also result in us incurring unexpected costs, charges, or expenses, and/or subject us to potential litigation relating to the Aya Merger that could be instituted against us and/or our respective directors and officers. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",
