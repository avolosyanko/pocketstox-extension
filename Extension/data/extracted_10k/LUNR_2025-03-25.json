      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nIntuitive Machines, Inc. (formerly known as Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. or “IPAX”), collectively with its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “IM,” “Intuitive Machines,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a space technology, infrastructure, and services company. We were founded in 2013 as Intuitive Machine, LLC and incorporated in February 2023 following the consummation of the Business Combination (as defined herein Note 1) of Intuitive Machines, Inc. and Intuitive Machines, LLC. \nAs a space technology, infrastructure, and services company, we are contributing to the establishment of cislunar infrastructure and helping to develop cislunar and deep space commerce. Cislunar encompasses objects in orbit in the Earth-Moon system and on the Lunar surface, while deep space exploration is space beyond the Moon, including Mars. We believe we have a leading position in the development of technology platforms operating in three core pillars —delivery services, data transmission services, and infrastructure as a service— as described below under Our Business Strategy. We are focused on establishing the lunar infrastructure associated with each of the three pillars, which provides the basis for commerce to inform and sustain human presence off Earth. Our vision is that our infrastructure services enable our customers to focus on their unique contributions to create a thriving, diverse cislunar economy and expand the commercial space exploration marketplace to the Lunar surface and beyond.\nThe United States (“U.S.”) government has indicated that returning to the moon is of strategic importance to the U.S. and we believe it will continue to have bipartisan support as we enter the next generation space race with the People’s Republic of China (“China”). We believe that space is the next economic frontier, with the moon being the next stepping stone, and the increased demand from governments, intelligence agencies, commercial industries, and private individuals has created multiple opportunities for long-term growth. We intend to participate in expanding the cislunar economy through a steady cadence of missions, with the intent of offering reduced cost of access and operations while providing reliable missions on a defined schedule. We are one of a select few companies servicing NASA and a worldwide set of commercial payload customers. We believe we have a strong position, as evidenced by four Commercial Lunar Payload Services (“CLPS”) awards to date as of December 31, 2024. On February 22, 2024, our Nova-C lander became the first U.S. vehicle to softly land on the lunar surface since 1972, utilizing our Nova-C Guidance, Navigation and Control (“GN&C”) and Propulsion systems, both of which were designed and are produced in-house. Our IM-1 Nova-C lander carried approximately 100 kilograms of science experiment and technology demonstration payloads, including the first CLPS payload, to a landing site closer to the lunar south pole than any previous mission. We operated on the lunar surface beyond the CLPS required mission duration and downloaded over 500 MB of payload customer data on our commercial Lunar Data Network. In March 2025, our IM-2 mission landed at the southernmost location of the moon, 5 degrees from the south pole. While in transit, our space to ground communications brought down over 8GB of data from space over our network; delivered 3 rideshare customers to trans lunar injection orbit and assisted them with ground tracking and communication; and demonstrated precision autonomous orbit operations circling the moon for 39 orbits over a 72 hour period. While on the surface, we demonstrated the ability to manage power in thermal conditions on the south pole surface and in a crater. With the challenge of not being able to recharge the IM-2 lander solar panels post landing, the mission was still able to complete several mission and payload milestones, including downloading 500 MB of payload customer data from the lunar surface. See Our Business Strategy for a description of our additional lunar missions, lunar relay communications, lunar vicinity navigation, and autonomous surface rover operations.\nThe U.S. Space Force (“Space Force”) has recently begun to turn its attention to the cislunar space, as noted in the Mitchell Institute paper “Securing Cislunar Space and the First Island Off the Coast of Earth.” As the leading CLPS provider and the first company to have successfully landed and operated on the Moon, we believe we are at the forefront of NASA's push for a sustainable return to the lunar surface, while simultaneously driving critical early conversations with the U.S. Department of Defense (“U.S. DoD”) and Space Force to secure the Moon and cislunar space to ensure peaceful and strategic operations in this emerging domain.\nOur Business Strategy\nWe are a leading space technology, infrastructure, and services company committed to fundamentally disrupting lunar access economics. Our innovative approach focuses on three core pillars (as described below) designed to meet the growing demand for lunar services and establish a robust lunar economy. \n•Delivery Services provides for the transportation and delivery of payloads, such as, satellites, scientific instruments and cargo to various destinations in space, in addition to rideshare delivery and lunar surface access.\n•Data Transmission Services offerings include the collection, processing, and interpretation of space-based data, utilizing AI applications, such as, command, control, communications, reconnaissance and prospecting.\n•Infrastructure as a Service delivers space assets performing tasks and making decisions without human intervention that are designed to perform essential functions, such as, navigation, maintenance, scientific data collection, and system health monitoring.\nWe integrate these fundamental pillars to not only enable access to the Moon but also lay the foundation for a thriving cislunar and deep space economy. We believe our delivery, data transmission, and infrastructure capabilities uniquely position us to drive innovation, create long-tail revenue streams, and ultimately support humanity’s push to establish profitable industries in space. We expect to achieve leading time to market across these core pillars driven by our short design to manufacture process, enabled through vertical integration and rapid iterative testing. We leverage technologies developed for our three core service pillars to expand into adjacent markets where these capabilities provide a competitive advantage. See Our Services and Solutions below for a detail discussion of our core pillars.\nOur Customers and Partners\nWe are an integral partner to our customers and partners. We execute on our commitments and develop solutions for our customers’ toughest challenges. \nOur customers include, but are not limited to: \nU.S. Government\n•NASA.  We are partnered with NASA and service NASA through four missions to date under their CLPS contract program. We work to provide NASA with access to the lunar surface as well as cislunar data for science, technology, and infrastructure. Our IM-1 mission landed 9 degrees from the lunar South pole in March 2024. In March 2025, our IM-2 mission landed at the southernmost location of the moon, 5 degrees from the south pole. With the challenge of not being able to recharge the IM-2 lander solar panels post landing, the mission was still able to complete several mission and payload milestones. We are also one of three prime contractors for NASA developing designs for a Lunar Terrain Vehicle, that includes the Nova-D lander. We were one of two awardees for NASA's Near Space Network Direct-To-Earth data services to the lunar vicinity (1.2) and beyond the lunar vicinity (1.3). We were also the sole awardee for the Near Space Network's data relay services (2.2), which will provide a constellation of satellites around the Moon to provide communications and navigation services.\n•National Security Space. We offer our cislunar service capability to customers in the National Security Space (“NSS”) sector, as well as in civil and commercial space. Customer needs for transportation, data transmission, and infrastructure services are similar in these sectors and we are actively pursuing opportunities with NSS customers. The Space Forces’ requirement to ensure freedom of action in space is driving their initial focus on cislunar Space Domain Awareness sensors and xGEO Position Navigation and Timing solutions as a result of the ongoing efforts by the U.S. and China to return to the lunar surface in a sustainable manner.\n•U.S. Department of Defense.  In 2023, we won our first significant award with the U.S. DoD Air Force Research Laboratory, the $9.5 million JETSON Low Power contract. \n•State Governments.  Many state governments are investing in space economy development, recognizing this as an emerging market with opportunities for growth for their constituents. With facilities in Texas, Arizona, and Maryland, we are actively engaged in partnering with state governments to expand our capabilities for economic growth. \nCommercial\nOur domestic customers for our first 3 missions include customers such as Columbia Sportswear Company, Nokia Corporation, Aegis Aerospace, Inc., and AstroForge.\nInternational\nOur global customers include national space agencies in Europe and Asia. Our largest international customer awarded us a contract for $16.8 million to provide lunar rover services.\nOur Partners\nOur partnerships are integral to our growth strategy. Under Delivery Services we partner with satellite communication companies, including Goonhilly to support our ground services and lunar missions. For Data Transmission Services we support our LDN network with various partners, including CesiumAstro and CSIRO. In addition, under Infrastructure as a Service, our Moon Reusable Autonomous Crewed Exploration Rover (“RACER”) is being developed for the LTV contract through a global partnership team including, AVL, Boeing, Fugro, Michelin, Northrop Grumman, and Roush. \nOur Services and Solutions\nDelivery Services\nWe utilize our proprietary lunar lander vehicles to service CLPS contracts by flying NASA scientific equipment and commercial payloads to the lunar surface and supporting mission operations. With four CLPS contracts awarded to date, we are pioneering lunar access. We are also scaling our lander capabilities to support larger payloads, including heavy cargo-class infrastructure delivery for projects like the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (“LTV”), ensuring a reliable path for sustained human and robotic exploration of the Moon.\nWe deliver experiments and technology demonstrations for both NASA and commercial customers, including deployment of the PRIME-1 drill to test for water ice and our Hopper, a drone to test the Nokia LTE network in space. During our IM-2 mission, we were able to conduct science with the PRIME-1 drill, and performed testing on the Nokia LTE network in space. Due to IM-2 mission’s landing anomalies, some payloads, such as the Micro-Nova Hopper was not deployed. The workhorse of the Nova-C lander is the VR900 liquid oxygen (LOX)/liquid methane (LCH4) engine, which is a fully additively manufactured (3D printed) rocket engine, which we design, manufacture, and test in-house at Intuitive Machines’ Lunar Production and Operation Center (LPOC). Building off the solid framework of our Nova-C lander systems and structures, we have designed a scalable production path for the development and construction of additional space vehicles. The Nova-D lander in development, intends to incorporate technologies developed for the Nova-C, and will have multiple variations built to support projected payload capacities of 500-2500 kilograms. The Nova-D has completed System Definition Review (SDR) and Preliminary Technical Reviews (PTRs). Our largest lander, the Nova-M, will use VR3500 engines to carry approximately 5,000-7,500 kilograms of payload to the lunar surface. Nova-M is a future development effort. These options are designed to afford flexibility for our customers as we pioneer a thriving, diverse lunar economy and enable a permanent presence on the Moon. Importantly, they are also all based on the same flight-proven LOX/Methane technology, which is designed and manufactured in-house. \nIn August 2024, NASA awarded Intuitive Machines a $116.9 million contract to deliver six science and technology payloads, including one European Space Agency-led drill suite to the Moon’s South Pole. This award leverages the Company’s lunar delivery, data transmission, and autonomous operation capabilities to explore the region targeted for sustained human operations. As part of NASA’s CLPS initiative, this marks the Company’s fourth contract award, IM-4, to deliver science and technology payloads and return valuable data while autonomously operating on the surface of the Moon. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the contracted value of our Delivery Services pillar includes $430.2 million of NASA CLPS and Tipping Point contracts, $52.4 million of commercial payloads, and $36.3 million of rideshares contracted on IM-2, IM-3 and IM-4. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have $1.6 million in commercial sponsorships and content sales, which provides us with another source of revenue outside of our core operations. Our three NASA lunar missions are contracted to fly on SpaceX’s Falcon 9. \nRevenue streams from delivery services are expected to include transportation and delivery of payloads (satellites, scientific instruments, and cargo) to various destinations in space, including rapid in-space mobility solutions enabled by our proprietary engine technology.\nData Transmission Services\nWe believe that our Data Transmission Services offering is made up of a validated and complete lunar communications solution. Our Lunar Data Network (“LDN”) consists of our Nova Control Center (“NCC”), our existing global collection of dishes called the Lunar Telemetry, Tracking and Communications Network (“LTN”), and a constellation of Lunar Data Network Satellites to be deployed as part of our NSN 2.2 contract award.\nIn September 2024, NASA awarded Intuitive Machines the sole NSN contract for communication and navigation services for missions in the near space region, which extends from Earth’s surface to beyond the Moon (NSN 2.2). The NSN contract is a firm-fixed-price, multiple award, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (“IDIQ”) task order contract, with a base period of five years with an additional five-year option, with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion. The initial NSN contract award includes incrementally funded task orders totaling $150.0 million over the next 3 years. As the sole \nawardee of the initial tranche of NSN contracts, we are deploying a constellation of lunar relay satellites to provide continuous cislunar communication and navigation services. This capability supports NASA’s Artemis missions while introducing a scalable, pay-by-the-minute data service model, enabling enhanced video, telemetry, and autonomous navigation. Our strategy leverages the additional performance capacity of our lunar landers to deploy satellites at marginal costs, creating a robust and cost-effective lunar communication infrastructure that forms the data backbone of our cislunar operations. We believe providing these lunar data and navigation services to NASA, NSS, and commercial/international customers will be an increasingly important priority. \nIn December 2024, NASA awarded Intuitive Machines NSN contracts for DTE services for the lunar vicinity (NSN 1.2) and beyond the lunar vicinity (NSN 1.3). These contracts allow use of terrestrial ground stations to support science missions in lunar orbit, on the lunar surface, or beyond the Moon. Our network is secured by layered levels of protection including advanced architecture, enterprise-level endpoint and antivirus protection, and Splunk advanced Security Information & Event Management (“SIEM”) control. Our Network Control Center (“NCC”) is located at our headquarters in Houston, Texas and was built from the ground up. NCC enables collaboration, innovation and seamless operations, in this 24-hour facility that was designed to provide tracking, telemetry and communications support for cislunar space and the surface of the Moon.\nOnce established and deployed, the data transmission services are expected to include and support NASA, U.S. national security, international, and commercial data needs. We will collect, transmit, and monetize data buys from data collected in-transit to the moon, in a variety of cislunar orbits, and on the surface of the moon for our future missions.\nInfrastructure as a Service\nOur Infrastructure as a Service pillar delivers essential systems and platforms to enable sustainable lunar exploration and commercial activity. By focusing on mobility, energy, and operational capabilities, we are creating the foundational infrastructure needed to support NASA’s Artemis campaign and commercial endeavors on the Moon. Key areas of focus include the LTV, its commercialization potential, and the Fission Surface Power (“FSP”) initiative, all designed to build a thriving and sustainable lunar economy.\nDuring 2024, NASA awarded Intuitive Machines $30.8 million for the LTV contract to support the agency’s Artemis Campaign as a prime contractor, leading the development of the Moon RACER, within NASA’s $4.6 billion LTV Services project. Designed to operate in extreme lunar conditions, including the Moon's South Pole, the LTV features advanced autonomous driving, power management, and communications systems. Engineered with input from Apollo-era astronauts, the Moon RACER combines modern technology with practical design elements like ergonomic controls and dual-side operability to optimize performance for Artemis astronauts. Delivered by our Nova-D cargo-class lunar lander, the LTV enhances crewed and robotic exploration capabilities by enabling the transport of scientific equipment, infrastructure, and lunar resources across vast distances.\nBeyond NASA’s Artemis program, we are driving the commercialization of the LTV to support diverse lunar infrastructure needs. The LTV is designed to manage a network of modular trailers that can support various applications, such as regolith harvesting, resource mining, biomanufacturing, and power generation. This innovative operational model mirrors Earth’s semi-truck and trailer logistics system, providing scalable and flexible mobility solutions on the Moon. Our LTV Commercialization Committee is actively engaging with science and business stakeholders to refine use cases, develop operational requirements, and determine pricing strategies for these services. By offering commercial mobility solutions, we aim to enable lunar businesses to thrive and extend the value of the LTV far beyond Artemis missions.\nTo address the critical need for reliable, continuous power on the Moon, we have collaborated with X-energy through the IX, LLC joint venture (further described in Note 15 - Variable Interest Entities) to develop a FSP system. This IX team was awarded a $5 million Phase 1 contract by NASA and the Department of Energy, and the IM-led team is maturing the design to support NASA’s fission reactor future and evolving needs to provide sustainable energy for lunar habitats, research stations, and autonomous operations. Integrated with our landers and lunar infrastructure, the FSP system is pivotal for supporting long-duration missions in harsh lunar environments, including 14-day lunar nights. In August 2024, the IX team was awarded a $2.9 million follow-on contract (Phase 1A) to continue to mature the design and conduct technology demonstrations to validate heat transfer to support energy generation. Leveraging our expertise in spacecraft design and lunar operations, Intuitive Machines is developing a reliable power source that not only supports NASA’s Artemis program but also lays the groundwork for future Mars exploration and commercial power needs.\nBy delivering mobility, power, and operational capabilities as services, Intuitive Machines is enabling a new era of exploration and sustainable economic growth, establishing the Moon as a thriving hub for science, commerce, and human expansion.\nAdjacent and Opportunistic Market Opportunities\nDue to Intuitive Machines’ unique technology platforms and engineering expertise, we are also pursuing and executing on business opportunities outside the three core pillars for customers aligned with our talent and product offerings. This includes work on the JETSON Low Power project for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the development of scalable reentry technologies, and federal engineering services contracts at various NASA centers. \nIn the $9.5 million JETSON Low Power project, we are helping AFRL develop the architecture and technology for deploying and maintaining a network of navigation beacons in cislunar space that require little-to-no support once delivered to their orbits. This includes a new radioisotope power generator that gives IM invaluable experience with nuclear power systems that can be applied to future lunar surface infrastructure, such as NASA’s FSP program.\nWe have also made significant progress to date in federal services contracts. Our federal service contracts provide us access to one of our key customers, NASA, allows us to develop technologies important for the cislunar economy, and provides a skilled labor force which can support our three core pillars. In 2023, we were awarded as the prime contractor by NASA on the OMES III contract, with a focus on spacecraft mechanisms and robotics. In addition in 2024, we were also selected as an awardee under the One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus Multi-Agency Contract (“OASIS+”). \nOur Competition\nCompetition in our addressable market is mainly divided between incumbents, such as Lockheed Martin and Blue Origin who pursue larger, more complex contracts such as crewed lunar missions, and next generation players, including our competitors on the CLPS contract such as Astrobotic and Firefly Aerospace. Competitors for the next phases of LTVS include Lunar Outpost and Astrolab Venturi and our competitors for the NSN contract included Kongsberg Satellite Services (“KSAT”), Swedish Space Corporation (“SSC”), and Telespazio.\nOur Operations\nSales:  Our sales organization operates directly and via our extensive customer and partner network, which spans across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Our partner network consists of our rideshare delivery providers, lunar surface mobility providers, payload providers, communication satellite provider, and ground segment providers.\nThe main responsibilities for our sales organization include ensuring contract renewals, maintaining relationships and expanding business with existing customers and partners, and acquiring new customers. We have deep expertise in capture efforts with the government customers, and have established processes to succeed with such customers. We leverage extensive existing relationships as well as our partner network and direct sales efforts to continue to win and grow business with commercial customers.\nWe work closely with our customers and partners to enable their success. Deeper adoption from our customers comes in many forms, including delivery of payloads to lunar orbit and the lunar surface, data and data relay services for users in the lunar vicinity, orbital services, lunar surface infrastructure, and space products and services.\nResearch and Development: Our research and development (“R&D”) team is integrated across our engineering organization to leverage the best engineers within each discipline and prevent stovepipes within our technology, yielding fully integrated systems that reduce time to market. Our R&D scope includes company rollover, acquisition, optimizing capital structure, and general corporate purposes. Our R&D team is also responsible for developing and innovating our proprietary technology platforms.\nWe continue to invest in R&D, particularly as it relates to “survive the night” and our larger lander design to make our platform more accessible to a wider range of customers, as well as innovating our space technology to capture various types of data efficiently. Current priorities include advancing our pump and tank technologies to gain greater efficiencies and performance.\nMarketing: Our marketing team utilizes a multi-channel approach to develop and increase our brand awareness, position and communicate the value of our differentiated offering, and develop engaging outbound demand-generation campaigns.\nThe team drives our overall market positioning and messaging across our key audiences and vertical markets, as well as provides strategic go-to-market assessments of use cases that emerge from new product capabilities and the market landscape. Our communications team works with targeted industry influencers and media outlets to drive interest through media channels, including blogs, social media, and video. This approach is important for our strategy to capture the entire market opportunity encompassing not only NASA and U.S. DoD, but also commercial aerospace and non-traditional customer segments engaged in partnership and content activity, who value brand activation from these engagements.\nSupply Chain\nOur ability to manufacture and operate our spacecraft is dependent upon sufficient availability of raw materials and supplied components including avionics, flight computers, radios, electrical power systems and fuel tanks.\nWe obtain raw materials and components from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We instill responsibility for quality at the lead level to ensure our suppliers and internally built hardware meet the required quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and components from multiple sources, in some cases raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. In these situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this risk through using material requirements planning, including material forecasting and planning, safety stock, and bulk and advance buying with focused efforts on long-lead items. Also, for a further discussion on our supply chain risks, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report, “We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials and supplied components. We may not be able to obtain sufficient materials or supplied components to meet our manufacturing and operating needs, or obtain such materials on favorable terms.”\nManufacturing, Assembly and Operations \nHouston, Texas. We have a leased integrated manufacturing facility in Houston, TX which includes our corporate headquarters and Lunar Production and Operations Center (“LPOC”) at the Houston Spaceport at Ellington Airport. The center was completed in late 2023 and spans across about 12.5 acres of real estate, and has more than 100,000 square feet of office and advanced production space. The LPOC serves as a production and testing facility of lunar lander components and other aerospace related operations. Our LPOC features tiered storage, an advanced loading dock, and a production area with 45-foot ceilings and crane capable of handling all Nova Lunar Lander designs. The manufacturing capability supports R&D, rapid prototyping and flight level hardware in an integrated and disciplined manner applying the correct level of rigor to the appropriate process. We are ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100D certified and adhere to the appropriate quality and process controls on a continuous basis. See “Item 2 Properties” for further discussion of our facilities.\nGlen Burnie, Maryland. In 2024, we expanded our Maryland presence and opened our leased 22,000 square foot Maryland facility that focuses on mechanisms and robotics. This facility builds and tests space-flight equipment and hardware. The staff consists primarily of mechanical and aerospace engineers, as well as electromechanical technicians and related engineering support staff. \nPhoenix, Arizona. In 2024, in connection with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (“LROC”) and Shadow Cam subcontracts, we opened our leased 16,000 square foot lunar data analytics facility in Phoenix, Arizona where we perform operations for lunar assets and operations, analyze landing site and mobility paths on the Moon. \nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 435 employees throughout our operations. At Intuitive Machines, our human capital management approach starts with a foundation in our core RIDE Values of Respect, Integrity, Dedication and Excellence. We value technical expertise, original thinking, adaptability, and a willingness to collaborate with our excellent team. While our original workforce is rooted in aerospace, we welcome new perspectives and technology expertise as we grow. We extend our corporate culture to create a safe and welcoming environment for all employees to reach their full potential, which improves performance outcomes, increases productivity, and boosts retention, employee morale and fellowship. From our lunar operations & production center in Houston, Texas, to our new mechanisms and robotics facility in Glen Burnie, Maryland, to our newest office for data scientists in Phoenix, Arizona, we’re deliberately creating onsite workspaces that are specific to our needs, allow for growth, and foster collaboration and innovation.\nIntellectual Property\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of trademarks, unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how, copyrights, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees, suppliers, and consultants to protect, control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information. We continually review and update our intellectual property portfolio to help ensure that we have adequate protections and rights.\nGovernment and Environmental Regulations\nGovernment Regulations\nCompliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur or will incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are or will be applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, export and import control, economic sanctions and trade embargo laws and restrictions and regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and other government agencies in the United States.\nWe contract with U.S. government agencies and entities, principally NASA, which requires that we comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. U.S. government contracts are generally subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the “FAR”), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, other agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements. Depending on the contract, these laws and regulations require, among other things:\n•certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;\n•defining allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. government contracts;\n•compliance with Cost Accounting Standards for U.S. government contracts (“CAS”);\n•reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”), Defense Contract Management Agency (“DCMA”) and other regulatory agencies for compliance with a contractor’s business systems; \n•restricting the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and\n•prohibiting competing for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated, neutralized or avoided.\nWe perform certain contracts under cost-reimbursable contracts with NASA and other U.S. governmental agencies. If the U.S. government concludes costs charged to a contract are not reimbursable under the terms of the contract or applicable procurement regulations, these costs are disallowed or, if already reimbursed, we may be required to refund the reimbursed amounts to the customer. Such conditions may also include interest and other financial penalties. If performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the customer retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Generally, our customers have the contractual right to terminate or reduce the amount of work under our contracts at any time. \nFurther, our business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the International Trade in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State (“ITAR”) and the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local, and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing pollution, the handling, storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contamination should it arise. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for a release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions, and third-party claims. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. \nAt this time, we do not believe that federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change \nlegislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.intuitivemachines.com.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business or results of operations. \nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur ability to be successful depends upon the efforts of our Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nOur ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of our Board and key personnel. We cannot assure you that our Board and key personnel will be effective or successful or remain with us. In addition to the other challenges they will face, such individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company, which could cause our management to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such requirements. \nThese challenges and uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. The departure of key employees because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWe have a limited operating history in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop in a manner favorable to our business. While our business has grown, and much of that growth has occurred in recent periods, the markets for launch services, space systems, spacecraft components and space data applications may not continue to develop in a manner that we expect or that otherwise would be favorable to our business. As a result of our limited operating history and ongoing changes in our new and evolving industry, including evolving demand for our products and services, our ability to forecast our future results of operations and plan for and model future growth is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors or cancellations of government programs, and our results of operations in future reporting periods may be below the expectations of investors or analysts. If we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our estimates and forecasts or the expectations of investors or analysts, causing our business to suffer and our common stock price to decline.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn order to achieve the substantial future revenue growth we have projected, we must develop and market new products and services. We intend to expand our operations significantly. To properly manage our growth, we will need to hire and retain additional personnel, upgrade our existing operational management and financial and reporting systems, and improve our business processes and controls. Our future expansion will include: \n•hiring and training new personnel;\n•developing new technologies;\n•controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n•continuing to improve the existing operational management and financial reporting systems and team to comply with requirements as a public company; and\n•implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes.\nIf our operations continue to grow as planned, of which there can be no assurance, we will need to expand our sales and marketing, research and development, customer and commercial strategy, products and services, supply, information technology, cybersecurity and manufacturing functions. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and \nother resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. We will also need to continue to leverage our manufacturing and operational systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to scale the business as currently planned or within the planned timeframe. The continued expansion of our business may also require additional manufacturing and operational facilities, as well as space for administrative support, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to find suitable locations for the manufacture of our space vehicles and related equipment. \nOur continued growth, including recent awards, could increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring and training employees, finding manufacturing capacity to produce our space vehicles and related equipment, and delays in production. These difficulties may divert the attention of management and key employees and impact financial and operational results. If we are unable to drive commensurate growth, these costs, which include lease commitments, headcount and capital assets, could result in decreased margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nCustomer concentration creates risks for our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 90% and 74% of our revenues came from one major customer. To the extent that any large customer were to default or otherwise fail to perform or be delayed in the fulfillment of its contractual obligations to us, changes its ordering patterns or business strategy, or otherwise reduces its purchases or stops purchasing our products or services, or if we experience difficulty in meeting the demand by these customers for our products or services, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nCompetition from existing or new companies could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities, and the loss of market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts from many other firms, including lower and mid-tier federal contractors with specialized capabilities and the federal government. Additionally, our markets are facing increasing industry consolidation, resulting in larger competitors who have more market share putting more downward pressure on prices and offering a more robust portfolio of products and services. We are subject to competition based upon product designs, performance, pricing, quality, and services. Our product performance, engineering expertise, and product quality have been important factors in our growth. While we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products that are directly comparable to products manufactured by others, in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products. Many of our customers and potential customers have the capacity to design and internally manufacture products that are similar to our products. We face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers, who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research, product development, and manufacturing versus outsourcing.\nIn addition, some of our foreign competitors currently benefit from, and others may benefit in the future from, protective measures by their home countries where governments are providing financial support, including significant investments in the development of new technologies. Government support of this nature greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with aerospace technology development activities for these competitors. This market environment may result in increased pressures on our pricing and other competitive factors.\nWe believe our ability to compete successfully in designing, engineering and manufacturing our products and services at significantly reduced cost to customers does and will depend on a number of factors, which may change in the future due to increased competition, our ability to meet our customers’ needs and the frequency and availability of our offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, and cash flows. A prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations or delays or cancellations of U.S. programs based on budgetary constraints, particularly those pertaining to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, and cash flows. Continued uncertainty related to recent and future government shutdowns, including related to a change in administration, the budget and/or the failure of the government to enact annual appropriations, such as long-term funding under a continuing resolution, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations. \nFurthermore, on January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced an executive order establishing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to maximize government efficiency and productivity. Pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government’s budget and potential changes in budgetary priorities, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing decisions by our customers.\nUnsatisfactory performance of our spaceflight systems or security incidents at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe manufacture and operate highly sophisticated spaceflight systems that depend on complex technology. We also work cooperatively with our suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners and other parties (collectively, “Third Parties”). Failures and disruptions or compromises to our or our Third Parties’ systems may be caused by natural disasters, fires (including wildfires), accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, bugs or vulnerabilities, physical or electronic break-ins, human error, intentional conduct, targeted cyberattacks, or similar events or incidents. While we have built operational processes to ensure that the design, manufacture, performance and servicing of our spaceflight systems and our facilities meet rigorous performance goals, there can be no assurance that we will not experience operational or process failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, pilot error, failure of Third Party safeguards, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or other intentional acts, that could result in potential safety risks. For example, the IM-2 mission experienced landing anomalies that impacted our ability to complete all mission milestones. There can be no assurance that our preparations, or those of Third Parties, will be able to prevent any such incidents.\nAny actual or perceived safety issues may result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to tort liability, maintenance, increased safety infrastructure and other costs that may arise. Such issues with our spaceflight systems, facilities, or customer safety could result in delaying or cancelling planned flights, increased regulation or other systemic consequences. Our inability to meet our safety standards or adverse publicity affecting our reputation as a result of accidents, mechanical failures, damages to customer property or medical complications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf any of our systems, the systems of any critical Third Parties upon which we rely or our customers’ systems are, or appear to be, breached, damaged, or if unauthorized processing of customer or third-party data is otherwise performed, public perception of our products services may be harmed, and we may lose business and incur losses or liabilities.\nThreat actors (such as ransomware groups) are becoming increasingly sophisticated and using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent security controls, to evade detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Our and our Third Parties’ technology systems and networks may be damaged, disrupted, or compromised by malicious events, such as cyberattacks (including computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious and destructive code, phishing attacks, and denial of service attacks), physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters, fire (including wildfires), power loss, telecommunications failures, personnel misconduct, and human error. Such attacks or security breaches may be perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by Third Parties. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target, we and our Third Parties may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. While we have implemented what we believe is an appropriate information security program with cybersecurity procedures, practices, and controls, the control systems, cybersecurity program, infrastructure, physical facilities of, and personnel associated with Third Parties that we rely on are beyond our control and we cannot guarantee that our or our Third Parties’ systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of Third Parties that support us and our products and services. In addition, our defensive measures, including back-up systems and disaster recovery plans, or those of our critical Third Parties, may fail to timely or effectively anticipate, detect, prevent or allow us to recover from cyberattacks.\nOur costs to adequately counter the risk of cyber-attacks and to comply with contractual and/or regulatory compliance requirements may increase significantly in the future. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of ours or our critical third-party systems or if there is a security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. Because we do not maintain cybersecurity insurance, these costs will come directly from us and this could harm our financial condition.\nThe market for commercial spaceflight is still emerging and may not achieve the growth potential we expect or may grow more slowly than expected.\nThe market for commercial spaceflight has not been established with precision and is still emerging. Our estimates for the total addressable market for commercial spaceflight are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including our current backlog, the number of consumers, assumed flight cadence, our ability to leverage our current manufacturing \nand operational processes and general market conditions. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct. The conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for commercial spaceflight, as well as the expected growth rate for the total addressable market for that experience, may prove to be incorrect.\nWe may experience delayed launches, launch failures, failure of lunar landers to reach their planned locations, failure of landers to conduct all mission milestones, significant increases in the costs related to launches of lunar landers, and insufficient capacity available from lunar lander launch providers. Any such issue could result in the loss of our lunar landers or cause significant delays in their deployment, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nDelays in launching landers are common and can result from manufacturing delays, unavailability of reliable launch opportunities with suppliers, launch supplier schedule delays, delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals, changes in landing coordinates, updates to mission specifications (including mission scope and objectives) and launch failures. If lander manufacturing schedules are not met, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the landers are ready to be launched. We also share launches with other manufacturers who may cause launch delays that are outside of our control. In addition, launch vehicles may fail, which could result in the destruction of any landers we have in such launch vehicle or an inability for the landers to perform their intended mission. Launch failures also result in significant delays in the deployment of landers because of the need to manufacture replacement parts, which typically takes up to six months or longer, and to obtain another launch opportunity. We also regularly review intended landing coordinates in order to determine the optimal landing site for our landers in consultation with NASA, while also updating mission specifications such as the scope of missions and the mission objectives. As such, from time to time, we have made, and expect to continue to make, material modifications to our missions, each of which may, alone or in the aggregate, cause us to experience material delays. Further, it could be more costly, and potentially prohibitively more costly, for us to launch and deploy our landers in the future due to increases in the cost of launches, launch insurance rates and launch-related services. In addition, any mission anomalies at launch, during transit, or during landing could limit our ability to complete all of our contracted mission milestones. Any launch failure, underperformance, mission anomalies, delay or increased cost on lander launches or related services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. \nWe may experience delayed satellite launches, failure of our satellites to reach their planned orbital locations, significant increases in production costs of our satellites. Any such issue could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nDelays in launching satellites are common and can result from manufacturing delays, updates to mission specifications (including mission scope and objectives) and launch failures. In September 2024, NASA awarded us a verification task order for NSN communication and navigation services for missions in the lunar region. For the Company to begin to have services under the NSN contract, we must successfully launch at least one satellite into a lunar orbit and five satellites to complete the constellation. If satellite schedules are not met, our operations may be materially adversely impacted. In addition, satellite deployment mechanisms may fail, which could result in an inability for the satellites to perform their intended mission. Further, it could be more costly, and potentially prohibitively more costly, for us to build and deploy our satellites in the future due to supplier cost increases. Any satellite failure, underperformance, delay or increase cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. \nWe have a history of net operating losses and may not achieve profitability in the future. We may need additional capital to fund our operations. If we fail to obtain additional capital, we may be unable to sustain operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand and develop, and we may need additional capital from external sources. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue one or more of our R&D programs. We may be required to cease operations or seek partners for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. In the absence of additional capital we may also be required to relinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in the development of our product candidates. \nOur business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance. Also, due to the inherent risks associated with commercial spaceflight, there is the possibility that any accident or catastrophe could lead to the loss of human life or a medical emergency.\nAlthough there have been and will continue to be technological advances in spaceflight, it is still an inherently dangerous activity. Explosions and other accidents on launch or during the flight have occurred and will likely occur in the future. If such incident should occur, we will likely experience a total loss of our systems, products, technologies and services and our customers’ payloads. The total or partial loss of one or more of our products or customer payloads could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For some missions, we can elect to buy launch insurance, which can reduce our monetary losses from the launch failure, but even in this case we may have uninsured losses associated with failures after launch and a launch failure will have losses associated with our inability to test our technology in space and delays with further technology development.\nFurther, commercial spaceflight is an inherently risky activity that can lead to accidents or catastrophes impacting human life. It is impossible to completely eliminate the potential for human error, and there is a possibility that other accidents may occur in the future as a result of human error or for a variety of other reasons, some of which may be out of our control. Any such accident could result in substantial losses to us, including reputational harm and legal liability, and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe release, unplanned ignition, explosion, or improper handling of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business operations involve the handling, production and disposition of potentially explosive and ignitable energetic materials and other dangerous chemicals, including materials used in rocket propulsion. The handling, production, transport and disposition of hazardous materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our manufacturing operations and could cause production delays. A release of these chemicals or an unplanned ignition or explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and others. Material property damage to us and Third Parties could also occur. Extensive regulations apply to the handling of explosive and energetic materials, including but not limited to regulations governing hazardous substances and hazardous waste. The failure to properly store and ultimately dispose of such materials could create significant liability and/or result in regulatory sanctions. Any release, unplanned ignition, or explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials and supplied components. We may not be able to obtain sufficient materials or supplied components to meet our manufacturing and operating needs, or obtain such materials on favorable terms.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and supplied components. We may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials or supplied components to meet our manufacturing and operating needs, or obtain such materials on favorable terms, which could impair our ability to fulfill our orders in a timely manner or increase our costs of production. \nOur ability to manufacture our launch vehicles is dependent upon sufficient availability of raw materials and supplied components, which we secure from a limited number of suppliers. Our reliance on suppliers to secure these raw materials and supplied components exposes us to volatility in the prices, quality, and availability of these materials. We may not be able to obtain sufficient supply of raw materials or supplied components, on favorable terms or at all, which could result in delays in manufacturing our spacecraft or increased costs. \nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in manufacturing or operations as we go through the requalification process with any replacement third-party supplier, as well as the limitations imposed by the ITAR and other restrictions on transfer of sensitive technologies. Additionally, the imposition of tariffs on such raw materials or supplied components could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, difficulty qualifying new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply or any volatility in prices could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in a cost-efficient, timely manner and could cause us to experience cancellations or delays of scheduled launches, customer cancellations or reductions in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner.\nWe sell complex and technologically advanced products and services, including rocket launch services, mission services, satellite services, spacecraft and spacecraft components. Sophisticated software used in our products and services, including software developed by us, may contain defects that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we manufacture or purchase from Third Parties. Most of the launch vehicles, spacecraft and spacecraft components we have developed must function under demanding and unpredictable operating conditions and in harsh and potentially destructive environments. Our products and services may not be successfully implemented, pass required acceptance criteria, or operate or give the desired output, or we may not be able to detect and fix all defects in the launch vehicles, spacecraft, spacecraft components and systems we sell and/or use. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue and damage to our reputation and may adversely affect our ability to win new contract awards.\nRising inflation may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation has increased recently. Inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have and may continue to experience cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of inflation, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk on contracts with customers. If a counterparty to one of our contracts were to default or otherwise fail to perform or be delayed in its performance on any of its contractual obligations to us, such default, failure to perform or delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur budgeted capital expenditures, forecasted growth and strategic plan are based on revenues expected to be generated pursuant to signed contracts existing as of the date such budget, forecast and strategic plan are approved by management and our Board. If a customer were to default or otherwise fail to perform or be delayed in the fulfillment of its contractual obligations to us, we would be required to adjust our budget, forecasts and strategic plans to mitigate the impact of such circumstance, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or liquidity. Additionally, if the scope of anticipated work related to any customer contract were to change due to unforeseen circumstances or evolving requirements of one or more of our counterparties, we may be unable to generate revenue on our anticipated timeline or may be required to incur increased costs from those originally estimated for a project, which could cause our budgets, forecasts and plans to be inaccurate. For instance, due to a change in the landing site of the IM-1 mission and an incremental delay in milestone payments, certain revenue associated with this mission shifted from 2023 to 2024. While we endeavor to mitigate this risk by assuming potential delays in revenue generation and estimated contract progress when preparing our budget, forecast and strategic plans, it is not possible to predict with accuracy the impact of any default, failure to perform or delay, which results in our inability to completely mitigate such risks. As such, the counterparty default, failure to perform or delay in performance may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nWe are dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business. \nWe depend heavily on technology and automated systems to effectively operate our business. Any substantial, extended, or repeated failures of these systems could negatively affect our business, compromise the security of our information or other information stored on, transmitted by, or otherwise processed by these systems, result in the loss of or damage to important data, loss of revenue and increased costs, and generally harm our business. Additionally, loss of key talent required to maintain and advance these systems could have a material impact on our operations. Like other companies, our systems may be vulnerable to disruptions due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, fire, power disruptions, software or equipment failures, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incursions, computer viruses and hackers. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to reduce the adverse effects of certain potential failures or disruptions are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions of our systems or prevent or mitigate all attacks. In addition, we will need to continuously make significant investments in technology to periodically upgrade and replace existing systems. If we are unable to make these investments or fail to successfully implement, upgrade or replace our systems, our operations and business could be adversely impacted. For example, in July 2024, certain businesses experienced disruptions related to a software update by a cybersecurity technology company. As of the date hereof, we have not experienced any significant impacts due to software updates, but we could in the future experience similar software-induced interruptions to our operations. \nWe may use artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our business or systems, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in competitive and reputational harm and negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nWe may incorporate AI solutions into our core offerings, and these applications may become important in our operations over time. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products or services more quickly or more successfully than we may, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, or biased, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI applications has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI applications could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. The rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, will require significant resources to develop, test and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nIf our prime contractors fail to maintain their relationships with their counterparties and fulfill their contractual obligations, our performance as a subcontractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe act as a subcontractor to prime contractors on multiple government contracts, including NASA’s JETS Program. Our performance as a subcontractor on a government contract, is dependent on the prime contractor’s ability to satisfactorily maintain its relationship with the government and fulfill its obligations under its contracts. A failure by the prime contractors to fulfill their obligations under their contracts could result in the termination of the prime contract or delayed revenue generation and recognition, thereby resulting in either the termination of our subcontract or material modifications to our subcontract. If any significant subcontract is terminated or delayed in this manner, it could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nGlobal pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks of infectious diseases or public health crises have disrupted our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nThe pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks of infectious diseases or public health crises across the globe have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt our business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future expectations. Any health crisis may negatively affect worldwide economic and commercial activity, disrupt global supply chains and the labor market and create significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The extent to which our business may in the future be affected by pandemics, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health crises depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including but not limited to the extent and duration of labor disruptions, business operations disruptions from quarantines, travel restrictions and other requirements imposed by regulators and health authorities, delays, modifications and terminations of contracts, supply chain disruptions, increased cybersecurity and data protection risks, increased costs of doing business and other macroeconomic disruptions.\nRisks Relating to Compliance with Law, Government Regulation and Litigation\nOur business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to various aspects of our business, including with respect to our launch system operations, employment and labor, health care, tax, data privacy of the personal information we collect and process and data security of the operational and information technology we use, health and safety, and environmental issues. Laws and regulations at the foreign, federal, state and local levels frequently change and are often interpreted in different ways, especially in relation to new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future regulatory or administrative changes. While we monitor these developments and devote a significant amount of management’s time and external resources towards compliance with these laws, regulations and guidelines, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be satisfactory to regulators or other third parties, such as our customers. Moreover, changes in law, the imposition of new or additional regulations or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts our business could require us to change the way we operate and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with these laws, such as with respect to obtaining and maintaining licenses, certificates, authorizations and permits critical for the operation of our business, may result in civil penalties or private lawsuits, or the suspension or revocation of licenses, certificates, authorizations or permits, which would prevent us from operating our business. For \nexample, the operation and launch of our spacecraft in the United States require licenses and permits from the FCC and the FAA, as well as review by other agencies of the U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense, Department of State, and NASA. Such license approvals may include an interagency review of safety, operational, national security, foreign policy implications and international obligations, as well as a review of foreign ownership. Any delays in regulatory actions allowing us to conduct our commercial space operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe rely upon unpatented trade secret protection, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our business and competitive position, and we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary form of intellectual property protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners, employees and consultants, and other third parties. However, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of information which we consider to be confidential, our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements, despite the existence generally of confidentiality provisions and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of the suppliers, subcontractors, venture partners, employees and consultants, and other third parties who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets as a result. It is also possible that our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information could be obtained by third parties as a result of breaches of our physical or electronic security systems. Even where remedies are available, enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets.\nAdditionally, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate, from using that technology or information to compete with us.\nThe U.S. government’s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government’s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to shut down or operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a “continuing resolution,” could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsiderable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the U.S. government, what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry and whether annual appropriations bills for all agencies will be enacted for U.S. government fiscal year 2024 and thereafter due to many factors, including but not limited to, changes in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, and any resulting uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and resultant funding. The U.S. government’s budget deficit and the national debt could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways, including the following:\n•The U.S. government could reduce or delay its spending on, reprioritize its spending away from, or decline to provide funding for the government programs in which we participate;\n•U.S. government spending could be impacted by alternate arrangements to sequestration, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, U.S. government spending priorities and levels; and\n•We may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by economic difficulties of our customers and prospective customers, including U.S. federal, state and local governments.\nFurthermore, we believe continued budget pressures could have serious negative consequences for the security of the U.S., the defense industrial base and the customers, employees, suppliers, investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. Budget and program decisions made in this environment would have long-term implications for us and the entire defense industry.\nOur systems utilize third-party open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source software licenses could adversely affect our business, subject us to litigation, or create potential liability.\nOur systems include software licensed from third parties under any one or more open source licenses, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software in our systems and technology in the future. Moreover, we cannot ensure that we have effectively monitored our use of open source software, or validated the quality or source of such software, or that we are in compliance with the terms of the applicable open source licenses or our current policies and procedures. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that use open source software in their products and services asserting that the use of such open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights. As a result, we could be subject to suits by third parties claiming that what we believe to be licensed open source software infringes such third parties’ intellectual property rights. Additionally, if an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these solutions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these solutions. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. Furthermore, these third-party open source providers could experience service outages, data loss, privacy breaches, cyber-attacks, and other events relating to the applications and services they provide that could diminish the utility of these services, and which could harm our business as a result. In the past, we’ve experienced software vulnerabilities with our software providers. We may continue to experience such vulnerabilities in the future.\nUse of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code, including with respect to security vulnerabilities where open source software may be more susceptible. In addition, certain open source licenses require that source code for software programs that incorporate, use or combine with such open source software be made available to the public at no cost and that any modifications or derivative works to such open source software continue to be licensed under the same terms as the open source software license. The terms of various open source licenses to which we are subject have not or may not have been interpreted by courts in the relevant jurisdictions, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or provide our software and data. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our solutions, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our solutions, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our solutions. Disclosing our proprietary source code could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales. Furthermore, any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to successfully complete any such re-engineering or other remedial efforts. Any of these events could create liability for us and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and the market price of our shares.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC regarding our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A Common Stock and your investment.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. This assessment, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting or implement these additional requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, it could result in material misstatements to our consolidated financial statements, failure to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, increases in compliance costs, and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, all of which may adversely affect investor confidence in, and the value of, our Class A Common Stock.\nAny unremediated material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our future annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or in delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose \nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are subject to stringent U.S. export and import control laws and regulations and U.S. economic sanctions and trade control laws and regulations.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. export control laws and regulations, including ITAR, Bureau of Political Military Affairs’ directorate of Defense Trade controls administered by the U.S. Department of State, and the EAR, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. Pursuant to these foreign trade control laws and regulations, we are required, among other things, to (i) maintain a registration under ITAR, (ii) determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and export classification of products, software, and technology, and (iii) obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorization to engage in the conduct of our space transport business. Violations of applicable export control laws and related regulations could result in criminal and administrative penalties, including fines, possible denial of export privileges, and debarment, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our ability to enter into contracts or subcontracts for U.S. government customers.\nThe inability to secure and maintain necessary export authorizations could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully or to operate our spaceflight business as planned. For example, if we were unable to obtain or maintain our licenses to export certain spacecraft hardware, we would be effectively prohibited from launching our vehicles from certain non-U.S. locations, which would limit the number of launch providers we could use. In addition, if we were unable to obtain a Department of State Technical Assistance Agreement to export certain launch related services, we would experience difficulties or even be unable to perform integration activities necessary to safely integrate our transfer vehicles to non-U.S. launch vehicles. In both cases, these restrictions could lead to higher launch costs which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Similarly, if we were unable to secure effective export licensure to authorize the full scope of activity with a foreign partner or supplier, we may be required to make design changes to spacecraft or updates to our supplier chain, which may result in increased costs to us or delays in vehicle launches.\nAny changes in the export control regulations or U.S. government licensing policy, such as those necessary to implement U.S. government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations. There is no inherent right to perform an export and given the significant discretion the government has adjudicating such authorizations in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, there can be no assurance we will be successful in our current and future efforts to secure and maintain necessary licenses, registrations, or other U.S. government regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, U.S. export control laws continue to change. For example, the control lists under the ITAR and the EAR are periodically updated to reclassify specific types of export-controlled technology. For example, any changes to the jurisdictional assignment of controlled data or hardware used by us could result in the need for different export authorizations, each then subject to a subsequent approval.\nSimilarly, should exceptions or exemptions under the EAR or ITAR, respectively, be changed, our activities otherwise authorized via these mechanisms may become unavailable and could result in the need for additional export authorizations. Additionally, changes to the administrative implementation of export control laws at the agency level may suddenly change as a result of geo-political events, which could result in existing or proposed export authorization applications being viewed in unpredictable ways, or potentially rejected, as a result of the changed agency level protocol.\nWe depend significantly on U.S. government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOver its lifetime, a U.S. government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to U.S. Congressional appropriations. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. Furthermore, on January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced an executive order establishing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to maximize government efficiency and productivity. Pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government’s budget and potential changes in budgetary priorities, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing decisions by our customers. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often initially receive only partial funding, and additional funds are obligated only as the U.S. Congress authorizes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations process ultimately approved by the U.S. Congress and the President of the United States or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing \nresolutions, as applicable. The termination of funding for a U.S. government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.\nGenerally, U.S. government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. government’s convenience upon payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. For some contracts, we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, and in those arrangements, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contractor for convenience without regard for our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that one or more of our U.S. government contracts will not be terminated under those circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. government contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contracts and services with the U.S. government are also subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the U.S. government has and may continue to implement initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices. These initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way U.S. government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, contracts awarded under the Department of Defense’s Other Transaction Authority for research and prototypes generally require cost-sharing and may not follow, or may follow only in part, standard U.S. government contracting practices and terms, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation and Cost Accounting Standards.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws and regulations, including those related to procurement integrity, export control (including ITAR), U.S. government security, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. government contracts.\nUncertain macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy and commodity prices, trade laws and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic and political conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nThe current invasion of Ukraine by Russia has escalated tensions among the U.S., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) and Russia. The U.S. and other NATO member states, as well as non-member states, have announced new sanctions against Russia and certain Russian banks, enterprises and individuals. These and any future additional sanctions and any resulting conflict between Russia, the U.S. and NATO countries could have an adverse impact on our current operations.\nFurther, such invasion, ongoing military conflict, resulting sanctions and related countermeasures by NATO states, the U.S. and other countries have led, and are likely to continue to lead, to market disruptions, including significant volatility in \ncommodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions for equipment, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Resources\nOur indebtedness could expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the future, we may incur indebtedness. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders, business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n•limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; and\n•placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves to pay any additional indebtedness that we may incur. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our indebtedness. If we fail to comply with such covenants or to make payments under any of our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full and cross-default or cross-acceleration under our other indebtedness and other liabilities.\nOur actual results may differ significantly from our earnings guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, quarterly earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The rapidly evolving market in which we operate may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed. However, actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook as of the date of release with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. Investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this “Risk Factors” section could result in our actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. \nWe are currently a “smaller reporting company” under federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive for so long as we rely on \nthese exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile. \nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe expect our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. Reductions in revenue in a particular quarter could lead to lower profitability in that quarter because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed in the short-term. We may incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and may not be able to recognize corresponding revenue in that same quarter. We may also incur additional expenses when contracts are terminated or expire and are not renewed. We may also incur additional expenses when companies are newly acquired.\nIn addition, payments due to us from our customers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures of government budgets to gain congressional and administration approval in a timely manner. The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends September 30. If a federal budget for the next federal fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year, our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved. Any such suspensions may reduce our revenue in the fourth quarter of the federal fiscal year or the first quarter of the subsequent federal fiscal year. The U.S. government’s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials.\nAny increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the U.S. government’s fiscal year end would serve to increase our third or fourth quarter revenue, but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter, as these activities generally are not as profitable as our typical offerings.\nAdditional factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include those addressed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the following factors, among others:\n•the terms of customer contracts that affect the timing of revenue recognition;\n•variability in demand for our services and solutions;\n•commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n•timing of shipments and product deliveries;\n•timing of award or performance incentive fee notices;\n•timing of significant bid and proposal costs;\n•the costs of remediating unknown defects, errors or performance problems of our product offerings;\n•variable purchasing patterns under blanket purchase agreements and other indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity contracts;\n•restrictions on and delays related to the export of defense articles and services;\n•costs related to government inquiries;\n•strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs and joint ventures;\n•strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n•changes in the extent to which we use subcontractors;\n•seasonal fluctuations in our staff utilization rates;\n•changes in our effective tax rate, including changes in our judgment as to the necessity of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets; and\n•the length of sales cycles.\nSignificant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular quarter could cause us to fall out of compliance with the financial covenants related to our debt, which if not waived, could restrict our access to capital and cause us to take extreme measures to pay down the debt, if any.\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, recoverability of assets, valuation of derivatives and nonredeemable non-controlling interests, contingencies, stock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, assumptions, policies or developments in the business, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our interest in Intuitive Machines, LLC, and, accordingly, we will depend on distributions from Intuitive Machines, LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and to pay dividends. Intuitive Machines, LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our equity interest in Intuitive Machines, LLC. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future are dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of Intuitive Machines, LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Intuitive Machines, LLC. Intuitive Machines, LLC and its subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us and applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, may not permit such distributions.\nWe anticipate that Intuitive Machines, LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of interests in Intuitive Machines, LLC, including us. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Intuitive Machines, LLC. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated (“A&R”) Operating Agreement, Intuitive Machines, LLC is obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with respect to any applicable credit agreements, to make tax distributions to holders of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units and Series A Preferred Units, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect could be significant.\nWe intend, as its managing member, to cause Intuitive Machines, LLC to make (i) pro rata tax distributions to the members of Intuitive Machines, LLC (“Intuitive Machine Members”) in an amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and to cover our tax obligations, other than with respect to income allocated to the Series A Preferred Units, but including payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) additional tax distributions to us to the extent necessary to cover our tax obligations with respect to income from the Series A Preferred Units and (iii) distributions to us to pay our operating expenses and to fund any dividends, including dividends made on the Series A Preferred Stock. However, Intuitive Machines, LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Intuitive Machines, LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Intuitive Machines, LLC insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations (including, if applicable, as a result of an acceleration of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement), we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in a termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement and the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nUnder the A&R Operating Agreement, we intend to cause Intuitive Machines, LLC, from time to time, to make pro rata distributions in cash to each holder of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units (including us) in amounts at least sufficient to cover the taxes imposed on their allocable share of net taxable income of Intuitive Machines, LLC. As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to Intuitive Machines, LLC’s other members, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations compared to individuals, and (iii) certain tax benefits that we anticipate from (a) future purchases or redemptions of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units from the Intuitive Machines Members (other than us) and (b) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, these cash distributions may be in amounts that exceed our actual tax liabilities with respect to the relevant taxable year, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our Board will determine the appropriate uses for any such excess cash, which may include, among other uses, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and the payment of other expenses. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash) to our stockholders. No adjustments to the exchange ratio for Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units and corresponding shares of Class A Common Stock will be made as a result of any cash distribution by us or any retention of cash by us, and in any event the ratio will remain one-to-one. To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our stock, we may take other actions with respect to such excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash, or lending it (or a portion thereof) to Intuitive Machines, LLC, which may result in shares of our Class A Common Stock increasing in value relative to the value of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units. Following such loan or a contribution of such excess cash to Intuitive Machines, LLC, we may, but are not required to, make an adjustment to the outstanding number of Intuitive Machine, LLC Common Units held by the Intuitive Machines Members (other than us). In the absence of such adjustment, the Intuitive Machines Members may benefit from any value attributable to such cash and/or loan balances if they acquire shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for their Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units, notwithstanding that such holders may have participated previously as holders of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units in distributions that resulted in such excess cash balances.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement with the TRA Holders (as defined below) requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Transactions, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with Intuitive Machines, LLC and certain Intuitive Machines Members (the “TRA Holders”). Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the TRA Holders equal to 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions), as a result of the Existing Basis, Basis Adjustments and Interest Deductions (each as defined below). The actual amount of cash tax savings will depend on, among other things, changes in the relevant tax law, whether we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and the timing of any future redemptions or exchanges of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units. We will depend on cash distributions from Intuitive Machines, LLC to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Any payments made by us to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have otherwise been available to us. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot precisely quantify the likely tax benefits we will realize as a result of the purchase of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units and Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to the TRA Holders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments will be substantial.\nThe payment obligation is an obligation of us and not of Intuitive Machines, LLC. Any payments made by us to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be available for reinvestment in our business and will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon one or more of the TRA Holders maintaining a continued ownership interest in Intuitive Machines, LLC or us. Furthermore, if we experience a Change of Control (as defined under the A&R Operating Agreement), which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations, we would be obligated to make an immediate payment, and such payment may be significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the payment relates. This payment obligation could (i) make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) result in holders of our Class A Common Stock receiving substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Accordingly, the TRA Holders’ interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A Common Stock. \nIn addition, decisions we make in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following a redemption or exchange of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units may accelerate the recognition of associated tax benefits for which we would be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the \ndisposition of assets before a redemption or exchange of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units increase the tax liability of the TRA Holders (or their transferees or assignees) without giving rise to any rights to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement with respect to tax attributes associated with such assets.\nThe ability to generate tax assets covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the actual use of any resulting tax benefits, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units by, or purchases of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units from, the TRA Holders (or their transferees or other assignees), the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the redemption, exchange or purchase; the extent to which such redemptions, exchanges or purchases are taxable; the amount and timing of the taxable income allocated to us or otherwise generated by us in the future; the tax rates and laws then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the TRA Holders may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (i) we materially breach any of our material obligations thereunder or the Tax Receivable Agreement is rejected by operation of law, (ii) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control were to occur after the Closing Date or (iii) we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successor’s obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments would be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is based on the present value (at a discount rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 100 basis points) of projected future tax benefits that are based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully use all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. \nAs a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment that may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. We could also be required to make cash payments to the TRA Holders that are greater than 85% of the actual cash tax savings we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. We may not be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which are complex and factual in nature, and the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or another taxing authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases or other tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such challenge. If the outcome of any such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially affect a recipient’s rights and obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our ability to settle such challenges may be restricted by the rights of the TRA Holders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and such restrictions apply for as long as the Tax Receivable Agreement remains in effect. In addition, we will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to a TRA Holder are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Holder will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make to such TRA Holder under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a TRA Holder for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we will not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined. Moreover, the excess cash payments we made previously under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be greater than the amount of future cash payments against which we would otherwise be permitted to net such excess. As a result, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement significantly in excess of 85% of the actual cash tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes with respect to a TRA Holder that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIf Intuitive Machines, LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and Intuitive Machines, LLC might be subject to potentially significant tax inefficiencies, and \nwe would not be able to recover payments we previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if the corresponding tax benefits were subsequently determined to have been unavailable due to such status.\nWe and Intuitive Machines, LLC intend to operate such that Intuitive Machines, LLC does not become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership, the interests of which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Under certain circumstances, exercises of the Intuitive Machines, LLC Options, redemptions and exchanges of Intuitive Machines, LLC Common Units pursuant to the Intuitive Machines Members’ redemption and exchange rights as described under the A&R Operating Agreement or other transfers of Intuitive Machines, LLC units could cause Intuitive Machines, LLC to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide for certain safe harbors from treatment as a publicly traded partnership, and we intend to operate so that redemptions, exchanges and other transfers of Intuitive Machines, LLC units qualify for one or more such safe harbors. For example, we intend to limit the number of unitholders of Intuitive Machines, LLC, and the A&R Operating Agreement provides for limitations on the ability of unitholders of Intuitive Machines, LLC to transfer their Intuitive Machines, LLC units and will provide us, as managing member of Intuitive Machines, LLC, with the right to impose restrictions (in addition to those already in place) on the ability of owners of Intuitive Machines, LLC to redeem, exchange or otherwise transfer their Intuitive Machines, LLC units to the extent we believe it is necessary to ensure that Intuitive Machines, LLC will continue to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf Intuitive Machines, LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, significant tax inefficiencies might result for us and for Intuitive Machines, LLC, including as a result of our inability to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with Intuitive Machines, LLC. In addition, we may not be able to realize tax benefits covered under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we would not be able to recover any payments previously made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement, even if the corresponding tax benefits (including any claimed increase in the tax basis of Intuitive Machines, LLC’s assets) were subsequently determined to have been unavailable.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as a result of our ownership of Intuitive Machines, LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Investment Company Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the Investment Company Act.\nAs the sole managing member of Intuitive Machines, LLC, we control and operate Intuitive Machines, LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in Intuitive Machines, LLC is not an “investment security” as that term is used in the Investment Company Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of Intuitive Machines, LLC, our interest in Intuitive Machines, LLC could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the Investment Company Act.\nWe and Intuitive Machines, LLC intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and Intuitive Machines, LLC are controlled by our Founders (as defined below), whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nOur Founders Dr. Kamal Ghaffarian, Stephen Altemus and Timothy Crain and their permitted transferees (collectively, the “Founders”), have control over almost all stockholder decisions because they control a substantial majority of the combined voting power. This may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters. As of March 18, 2025, our Founders collectively control approximately 62% of the combined voting power of our common stock primarily as a result of their ownership of Class C Common Stock, each share of which is entitled to three votes on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs a result, the Intuitive Machines Founders have the ability to control any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and thereby determine corporate and management policies, \nincluding potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and other significant corporate transactions for so long as they retain significant ownership of our Class C Common Stock. This concentration of ownership and voting power may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of us and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such events are in the best interests of minority stockholders. This concentration of voting power may have a negative impact on the trading price of Class A Common Stock. \nOur Founders are entitled to vote their shares, and shares over which they have voting control, in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Because our Founders hold their economic interest in our business through Intuitive Machines, LLC, rather than through us, they may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of Class A Common Stock. For example, our Founders may have a different tax position from us, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control within the meaning of the Tax Receivable Agreement or terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.” In addition, our Founders’ ability to effectively control us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of Class A Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price. \nWe cannot predict the impact our multi-class structure may have on our stock price.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. Our multi-class capital structure may make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. In addition, other stock indices may take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and would make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the trading price and volume of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected. \nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nDelaware law and the Certificate of Incorporation and our bylaws (the “By-Laws”) contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the DGCL, contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by the Board and therefore depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the then-current members of the Board or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions regarding:\n•the ability of the Board to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n•the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n•the right of the Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board;\n•the requirement that directors may only be removed from the Board for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of the then outstanding capital stock;\n•a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent (except for actions by the holders of Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock or as required for holders of any series of preferred stock), which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Board, the chairman of the Board or chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n•controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of the Board and stockholder meetings;\n•the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend, alter, change or repeal certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Board and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n•the ability of the Board to amend the By-Laws, which may allow the Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the By-Laws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n•advance notice procedures with which our stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to the Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Board and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Board or management.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are generally subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. Any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation designates a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings between us and our stockholders, and the federal district courts as the exclusive forum for Securities Act claims, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of Intuitive Machines, Inc. to it or its stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us or our officers or directors arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws or any provision thereof, (e) any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, employee, stockholder or agent of Intuitive Machines, Inc. governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware or (f) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. The Certificate of Incorporation also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This provision in the Certificate of Incorporation does not address or apply to claims that arise under the Exchange Act; however, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent these provisions could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions in connection with such claims, and stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities of will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation described in the preceding paragraph. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar exclusive-forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in the Certificate of Incorporation is inapplicable or \nunenforceable. If a court were to find these exclusive-forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm its results of operations.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if it becomes subject to certain claims, litigation or shareholder activism, which could, among other things, cause us to incur significant expense, negatively impact our reputation, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact our stock price. \nWe may be subject to certain claims, litigation, shareholder activism or other proceedings, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations. Securities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our business. Additionally, the Company has been, and may in the future become, subject to litigation from customers, suppliers or other parties. For example, on November 22, 2024, an alleged successor in interest to a purported former holder of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock (the “Plaintiff”) filed a breach of contract action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that Plaintiff’s predecessor received fewer shares of common stock upon conversion of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock than it was allegedly entitled to receive under the terms of the applicable certificate of designation. The Plaintiff is seeking unspecified contractual damages and equitable relief. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend the litigation, we cannot be certain as to the ultimate outcome of this matter or as to any potential losses we may incur, which may be material. Any litigation could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any litigation and activist stockholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any litigation and stockholder activism. \nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of Class A Common Stock, which could depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of Class A Common Stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for Class A Common Stock at a premium to the market price and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of our securities in the public market by our existing securityholders could cause the price of our shares of Common Stock to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of our shares of Class A Common Stock in the public market by our other existing securityholders, or the perception that those sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, the Equity Incentive Plan or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees and directors under the Equity Incentive Plan. We also intend to raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.",
