      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPlanet’s mission is to use space to help life on Earth, by imaging the world every day and making global change visible, accessible, and actionable. \nWhat: We image the Earth every day at medium- and high-resolution. We collect this powerful data set from the hundreds of satellites we have in orbit, making our fleet the largest fleet of Earth observation satellites in history, which we design, build, and operate. We have collected over 3,000 images on average for every point on Earth’s landmass, creating a non-replicable historical archive for analytics, machine learning, and insights.\nWhy: Our satellite data and analytics reveal actionable insights regarding a large array of important phenomena, such as deforestation, agriculture, climate change, biodiversity, and supply chains worldwide. Our daily stream of proprietary data and machine learning analytics, delivered over our cloud-native platform, helps companies, governments and civil society use satellite imagery to discover insights as change happens.\nWho: We currently serve customers across large commercial and government verticals, including agriculture, mapping, energy, forestry, finance and insurance, as well as federal, civil, state, and local governments. Our customers in government and commercial markets leverage our product capabilities to monitor and manage global change over broad areas to take action.\nHow: Our customers can embed our Earth data and change detection capabilities into their workflows to better inform their decision-making processes. Our historical archive of global, daily imagery data enables back-testing of predictive analytics, which is particularly relevant for time-series forecasting, an important area in machine learning.\nWe generate revenue primarily by selling licenses to our data and analytics to customers over a cloud-based platform via fixed price subscription and usage-based contracts. Most of our revenue is recurring in nature. We use a “one-to-many” data subscription model, as each image we capture can be sold and leveraged for analytics an unlimited number of times. We believe this is different from legacy Earth observation providers that sell individual images exclusively to a single customer.\nPublic Benefit: Our business model is aligned with our mission and public benefit purpose: to accelerate humanity toward a more sustainable, secure and prosperous world by illuminating environmental and social change. We are dedicated to the continuous pursuit of creating an unbiased, scientifically accurate, and trusted source of data about the changing planet.\nIndustry Trends\nWe believe that the increasing call for global peace and security, as well as the digital and sustainability transformations of the global economy, are fueling a need for a greater volume of and more rapidly delivered Earth observation data. We believe that we can accelerate this transformation by providing valuable Earth data that businesses and governments can utilize to better measure and monitor change in physical assets.\nPeace & Security: Organizations such as governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (“NGOs”), media and think tanks are tackling increasingly complex global challenges on a daily basis. We believe that our satellite imagery, satellite hardware development capabilities, and tools can help enable unbiased, factual, and timely reporting and decision making by governments, NGOs, media and think tanks. Further, we believe the data from space that we provide is critical to global transparency and to encourage peace and security. \nSustainability Transformation: Organizations globally are focused on proactively managing their environmental impact and operating more sustainably. While regulations overseeing environmental impact and sustainability are \nsubject to policy makers’ priorities in each country or region, we believe the shift toward monitoring and managing environmental outcomes and responding to natural disasters will continue; and that satellite imagery and capabilities are a critical component of effective and broad-scale sustainability solutions. \nDigital Transformation: Organizations across industries are driving operational improvements and taking advantage of new growth opportunities by leveraging third-party data, their own proprietary data, and artificial intelligence technologies, including generative artificial intelligence technology (“GenAI”) and large language models (LLMs) (collectively, “AI”), all of which are driving a digital economic shift across many sectors. In addition, as more organizations digitize their workflows, it is increasingly important to deliver solutions that are cloud-native to take advantage of the cost savings and scale derived from cloud technologies. \nOverall, we believe these transformational shifts are driving demand for near real-time understanding of the impact of global changes across the Earth. The first step for organizations undergoing the digital and sustainability transformations, as well as those seeking to establish and maintain peace and security, is to understand context and consistently measure and monitor relevant data. With shared context and metrics, we believe that businesses and governments can improve operational efficiency, resource allocation, risk mitigation, and strategic decision making with data-enabled applications.\nOur Opportunity\nOur founding team built Planet on the concept of “agile aerospace” methodology: the rapid development and deployment of new space-based hardware and related software systems, similar to the “agile software” approach of releasing early and often to rapidly iterate capabilities. By harnessing trends in miniaturization, we have built, launched, and maintained hundreds of compact, powerful satellites at a significantly lower cost than traditional aerospace companies, an improvement that we believe is similar to the transition from the mainframe computer to the desktop computer. This has enabled us to leverage industry innovations in AI, computing, and cloud-based storage to house and analyze a distinctive data set of daily Earth changes, and to build market-leading tools to help customers and partners extract value from those data sets. Our innovation in agile aerospace has also enabled us to improve the cost-performance of satellite manufacturing, ground stations, and mission operations.\nOur extensive Earth data set and robust analytic capabilities which are optimized to monitor ongoing activity, are delivered through our cloud-native platform. By providing this analytic ready data to our partner ecosystem as well as our end customers, we believe we can expand the use cases we can address across industries at scale. We believe globally consistent and reliable satellite imagery data is a critical component that can fuel the impact of these economic transitions across sectors.\nWe believe enabling major industries to make data-driven decisions by simplifying access to remote sensing data is central to the evolution of the existing geospatial sector and creates a large market opportunity to advance the digital transformation and sustainability trends in society, business, and in the public sector. We see market opportunities in industries including:\nAgriculture: Our data can enable precision agriculture, harvest planning, directed scouting, crop monitoring, sustainable agricultural monitoring, irrigation and pasture management, and soil and moisture management. \nCivil Government: Our data can enable forest health monitoring, agriculture monitoring and food security, protection of biodiversity, ecosystems and parks, water conservation and efficiency, permitting and code enforcement, disaster management, geo-mapping, and smart city planning.\nDefense & Intelligence: Governments are strategically engaging with commercial space and remote sensing companies to leverage sharable, unclassified subscription products to complement more traditional defense and security industrial solutions. In addition, we believe geo-mapping foundation data, maritime domain awareness, humanitarian and disaster recovery, and natural resource monitoring are examples of the many potential drivers of this opportunity.\nEnergy & Utilities: We view infrastructure and asset monitoring, proof of permit and code enforcement, air and water pollution monitoring, spill and disaster management, and earth data for geo-mapping services associated with these use cases, among others, as significant drivers of this market opportunity.\nSustainability Monitoring and Supply Chain: We see climate and sustainability-related regulations, risk assessments, consumer expectations, and brand reputation pressures as significant factors requiring companies to identify, monitor, track and publish sustainability targets and related infrastructure. Other significant drivers of this opportunity may include carbon footprint management and air and water pollution monitoring.\nFinance and Insurance: We believe there are broad opportunities including investment research, portfolio risk assessment and management, and insurance and reinsurance products. For example, improvements in measuring and predicting outputs from the world’s natural resources has the potential to help optimize the efficiency of commodity trading markets.\nForestry: We believe there are also opportunities in commercial forest management and disease and pest monitoring, as well as the use of geo-mapping data required to monitor change.\nOur Operations\nOur Fleet: We continue to iterate our satellites and operations for optimal efficiency and function, using our own production capabilities, as well as third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Information about risks related to our satellite development, manufacturing and operations appears in the “Risk Factors” section of this report.\nSales: Our global sales organization operates directly and indirectly via our extensive network of hundreds of partners around the world. Our partner network consists of solution providers, OEM platform partners, systems integrators and geographical information system (“GIS”) software companies that broaden the earth data ecosystem and have deep expertise in building last-mile industry solutions using satellite imagery and geospatial data. Our partner ecosystem bolsters our global presence with regional and domain-specific expertise and expands our market access to more industries, geographies and users.\nIn addition, our sales organization includes industry account and channel sales representatives as well as dedicated customer success and technology support teams. Our sales team is primarily organized by customer industry to support customer adoption and growth within each sector that we serve. Key responsibilities for our sales organization include acquiring new customers, maintaining relationships and expanding business with our existing customers, and driving contract renewals. At the center of our team’s philosophy is a strong customer and market feedback loop between our sales organization, customer success, and product development teams, which we believe helps to inform our technology roadmap and better serve our customers.\nWe work closely with our customers and partners to enable our customers’ early success, both from an account management and technical management perspective, with the goal of driving deeper adoption of our platform by our customers (for example, through additional users, area coverage, and advanced software analytics capabilities).\nMarketing: Our marketing team utilizes a multi-channel approach to develop and increase our brand awareness and position to communicate the value of our differentiated offering, and to develop engaging outbound demand-generation campaigns.\nWe utilize an end-to-end buyer’s journey approach to develop awareness and lead-generation activities that engage and nurture prospective customers and expand opportunities within our existing base of customers. The team drives our overall market positioning and messaging across our key audiences and vertical markets, as well as provides strategic go-to-market assessments of use cases that emerge from new and existing competitors that are part of the market landscape. Our communications team also works with targeted influencers and media outlets to drive interest and thought leadership through earned and owned media channels, including blogs, social media, and video.\nResearch and Development: Our research and development (“R&D”) team consists of software and hardware R&D for product discovery, technology incubation, and go-to-market planning. Our R&D teams are increasingly focused on leveraging the rapid development in AI, machine learning, and the evolving information technology architecture for massively distributed data collection, storage, and analysis. Our R&D function also manages our investments in our agile space missions, including advancing core spacecraft technologies, automated mission operations for our satellite fleet and ground stations, payload prototypes and development, and engineering operations to drive potential scale efficiencies. Our R&D team at Planet is also responsible for developing and innovating our proprietary technology platform.\nWe continue to invest in R&D, particularly as it relates to building software solutions on top of our data to help make our platform more accessible to a wider range of customers and partners, as well as innovating our space technology to capture valuable and differentiated data sets. \nTechnology Partnerships: We engage in partnership programs and strategic efforts to embrace open innovation, technology infusion and market-shaping opportunities. These efforts include our technologies partnerships, such as with Carbon Mapper and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and our partnerships with Telesat and SES as part of the NASA Communications Services Project (“CSP”). We also go to market with analytics partners focused on leveraging GenAI and LLMs to derive valuable and actionable information from our Earth Observation data. Finally, we encourage product experimentation by users via initiatives such as our Education and Research Program, among others.\nOur Technology \nSince our founding, we have built capabilities across three deep core competencies, each operating together to accelerate the digitization and sustainability transformations. These include (1) Agile Aerospace; (2) Proprietary Big Data; and (3) Our Platform and Analytics.\nAgile Aerospace: We are a pioneer in “agile aerospace” — the rapid development and deployment of new space-based hardware and related software systems. We believe making powerful satellites in small packages has enabled us to launch more satellites than our nearest competitor. It enables us to design missions that were unheard of until recently, such as our daily data set delivered via our satellite fleet. It has further allowed us to rapidly innovate — resulting in more and better data for our customers, as compared with historical data satellite services, allowing us to drive the expansion of our platform and customer base and inform what future data sets to collect. We also believe it enables us to quickly address emerging market requirements ahead of other providers. \nWe have engaged in strategic partnerships leveraging our agile aerospace approach and differentiated technology. Examples of this include our Tanager hyperspectral satellite, made possible by the philanthropically funded Carbon Mapper Coalition, and the satellite services agreement with SKY Perfect JSAT announced in January 2025. Under the JSAT agreement, Planet expects to build, launch, and operate 10 Pelican high-resolution tasking satellites for JSAT. Planet intends to leverage the increased capacity of the expanded fleet to serve government and commercial customers around the world. We may engage in similar satellite services engagements in the future.\nProprietary Big Data: Our technology is designed to put the power of knowledge about the Earth into the hands of more people. Our aerospace innovation has enabled us to maintain the world’s largest fleet of imaging satellites in history, with the capability to image the world every day. This has enabled us to generate a proprietary, vast data archive that grows daily.\nWith our fleet of satellites, we are able to collect unique and proprietary global data every day and high-resolution data of a specified location several times per day with agile tasking. Once the raw data is collected, our data pipeline leverages machine learning and AI capabilities married with remote sensing science to automate the data processing and produce analytics-ready, Earth data.\nUsing and contributing to open data standards via the Open Geospatial Consortium, our cloud-native proprietary technology, autonomously performs critical processing and overall harmonizing of images for time series and for \nuse in data fusion and analysis. We collect hundreds of millions of square kilometers of Earth data every day, collected over the Earth’s landmass and some areas of water. These images are added to our archive of proprietary Earth observation data dating back to 2009 and daily Earth scanning data dating back to 2017. Because this immense historical archive is impossible to go back in time to re-collect, we believe it represents a significant competitive advantage. Our deep data archive is used to train our models, an important asset for delivering useful insights. \nOur fleet of satellites enables us to provide proprietary data solutions, including: (1) Planet Monitoring, (2) Planet Tasking, and (3) Planet Hyperspectral. \nPlanet Monitoring: Our SuperDove satellites work together to create an always-online scanner for the planet with the goal to image the Earth every day at a resolution (Ground Sampling Distance, “GSD”) of up to 3.5 meters. This allows our customers to monitor any areas of interest, discover trends, identify changes and gain timely insights — and is the backbone to our one-to-many business model. We also combine Planet Monitoring with other scientific-grade radiometric data from public satellite data programs, including NASA/USGS-Landsat and ESA/EU Copernicus, to provide customers with a stream of consistent Earth data, using an algorithm that corrects variability in sensors to produce a consistent feed of data for valuable time-series analyses. This pre-processing and data harmonization often eliminates the need for additional data preparation before a customer can run advanced analytics on the data, which helps make satellite imagery analysis easier and practical, particularly for machine learning applications.\nPlanet Tasking: With high-resolution satellites in orbit and our rapid revisit capability, we can capture a specified location several times per day to achieve a resolution (GSD) of up to 50 centimeters after processing. The agile tasking satellites, all powered by an application programming interface (“API”), can perform multiple imaging modes, including points, long strips, stereo collects, and video.\nPlanet Hyperspectral: Our hyperspectral imaging satellite, Tanager, is designed to deliver full-spectrum imagery across the visible and shortwave infrared regions, capturing over 400 spectral bands at a resolution (GSD) of 30 meters. Tanager was developed in collaboration with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and sponsored by Carbon Mapper, a philanthropically-funded effort to detect and track methane and CO2 super-emitters. Tanager-1, the first satellite in this offering, was launched in August 2024. \nPlatform and Analytics: Our cloud-native Earth Observation platform enables customers and partners to access, analyze, and act on our proprietary data catalog by discovering relevant data layers, extracting useful information, and delivering insights through custom-build solutions or GIS workflows via APIs and browser-based applications. We have recently made Planet data available for purchase more simply and directly through our Planet Insights Platform (which has integrated the former Sentinel Hub platform), which facilitates rapid user adoption, particularly by empowering users to self-service our solutions without formal sales interaction. We believe this serves as a natural entry point for some of our smaller accounts, enabling them to realize the value of Planet’s offerings, leading to broader awareness of our solutions throughout their networks and organizations.\nCore to making this data more impactful are our Analytics products, which leverage computer vision to detect objects and highlight attention on certain occurrences, and our Planetary Variables, which provide measurements of key phenomena occurring on the Earth’s surface. Some of our derived products leverage data from third party sources, such as those produced by the government-operated fleets like Sentinel and LandSat, which enhance the value of our derived products.\nWe also work closely with partners, particularly those focused on leveraging Generative AI technology (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive actionable insights from Planet’s Earth Observation data. We aim to continuously acquire, integrate and partner with new capabilities and tools, thereby improving the user experience of our platform as well as providing tools that simplify the use of earth observation data. Essentially, we believe enhanced derived product solutions can speed up the mission utility and business value for our customers and partners.\nWe offer customers a variety of capabilities, including the following:\n(1)Planet APIs: We provide APIs for hosting, analyzing, and streaming our satellite data archive, including data from government-operated fleets like LandSat and Sentinel. With Planet APIs, developers can quickly and efficiently do raster and statistical analysis, and stream the results into GIS software. Many customers use Planet data and APIs to power web applications and large data pipelines.\n(2)Planet Apps: We have developed proprietary web applications that make it easy to work with our geospatial data. These applications enable customers to order through our platform, perform real-time image correction, monitor areas for change over time, work with analytics, and create and store easy-to-use artifacts. Given the high volume and quality of our imagery and historical archive, these tools provide an optimal platform to access our data.\n(3)Planet Basemaps: Using proprietary algorithms on our daily global imaging, we build basemaps from the most recent imagery over broad areas. Our machine learning algorithms select the best pixels from hundreds of thousands of scenes, removing clouds and transforming the images into visually consistent and scientifically accurate basemaps that empower AI-ready time-series analysis. We create global basemaps monthly and deliver custom basemaps to our customers for selected areas and times.\n(4)Planet Analytic Feeds: We have built automated, cloud-native, global-scale analytics on top of our data set and made them accessible by APIs and web applications. Drawing on cutting edge techniques in machine learning and computer vision from Planet and with partners, Planet Analytic Feeds harness the power of our extensive imagery archive to detect distinct objects, including vessels, aircraft, roads and buildings, and identify changes in our imagery.\n(5)Planetary Variables: We produce and offer Planetary Variables advanced algorithms that process satellite data from Planet’s satellites and broader observations from a range of public satellite constellations, including NASA LandSat and ESA Sentinel satellites, among others. These programs capture different but complementary data sets, such as passive microwave data, other spectral bands, and more. Our goal with these products is to capture and quantify the changes in dynamic systems such as soil water content, land surface temperature, crop biomass and forest carbon and structure, and render that information to the people on the ground tasked with making decisions.\nOur Customers\nOur customers frequently subscribe to daily data feeds covering their areas of interest. Historically, specially trained technical imagery analysts typically had to hand-process satellite data that was months out-of-date. We are able to deliver powerful capabilities including both data and analytics directly to customer and partner workflows daily through automated interfaces.\nWe are committed to building deep relationships with our customers by providing easy access to critical geospatial data and analytics in an increasingly consumable format. In addition, with our subscription services and data products, customers can monitor and detect changes and create insights that can help drive timely decision-making, and improve operational efficiency, resource allocation, and risk assessment and mitigation.\nWe have a proven record of building customer relationships, with customers across the globe, including leading agriculture, mapping, energy, forestry, finance and insurance companies, and government agencies. \nOur performance is subject to a number of variables, and as such, we cannot assure you that our results will continue in the same trajectory as our historical results, nor can we assure you that our results will be indicative of our future performance. For more details, please read the section entitled “Risk Factors.”\nOur Competitive Position\nWe believe our cutting edge technology, our industry experience, and our scalable business model, enabled by the one-to-many use of our data, set us apart from our competitors.\nOur competitive moats include agile aerospace mission capabilities, proprietary big data, and platform analytics. Our advanced space systems enable the capture of comprehensive, high quality, proprietary data, which power our platform, enhanced by advanced analytics that utilize both Planet and partner AI and machine learning to provide solutions to our customers. We believe that as customers derive more value from our solutions, they increase their usage by incorporating insight from our data into their workflows and analyses. This creates a feedback loop that drives our technology roadmap, from the high-level analytics and end-user applications all the way down the stack to new sensors in space to capture valuable information for our customers.\nDifferentiated Offering: We believe our offerings set us apart from other companies in the geospatial data industry. We combine our daily scanning capabilities, which enable broad area monitoring at a significant scale, with our complementary high-resolution and hyperspectral satellites, which customers can task to capture a higher resolution image or additional spectral bands of specific areas of interest. Additionally, we believe our archive of historical Earth data and analytics capabilities also set us apart from our competitors by allowing us to speed up the mission utility and business value for our customers and partners.\nScalable Business Model: We provide our Data Solutions and Platform and Analytics Solutions primarily through recurring subscription- and usage-based revenue contracts, which provide visibility into potential future growth. With our one-to-many business model, our margins improve with economies of scale, as there is low marginal cost to sell incremental access to our data. Because we can sell our imagery data and analytics to multiple end customers, we believe our solutions enable us to capture market share across broad vertical markets.\nIndustry Experience: We were one of the earliest next generation commercial geospatial companies, and we believe our agile aerospace innovations and fully operational fleet of Earth-imaging satellites have put us years ahead of the competition. We have hundreds of satellites in orbit as well as a comprehensive platform for data processing, delivery and image data integration to enable customers to realize value from our satellite data. As a result, we believe we have higher operational efficiency, more extensive proprietary historical data sets, economies of scale in data storage and processing, and proven execution by our global sales organization. With a strong first-mover advantage through our daily Earth scans, we believe we are well positioned to capture this market and continue innovating ahead of emerging players.\nIn addition, our management team has deep technical expertise in scaling software, data, and space technology and extensive experience operating and leading companies and a strong track-record of building market making businesses.\nOur Competition\nCompetition in Earth Observation Satellites: We see the satellite imagery industry as mainly divided between incumbents, such as Airbus and Maxar, and next generation players, such as BlackSky, Satellogic, and CG Satellite. Incumbents have typically hosted a limited number of active satellites which operate on a one-to-one tasking system. These satellites are typically very high cost with very high resolution, primarily serving national governments and other traditional satellite imagery industries. In contrast, next generation satellite imagery companies have developed satellites that are lower cost and smaller in size and have a stated ambition to increase the presence of their fleets within Earth’s orbit. \nCompetition in Data Analytics: We also compete and see competition with some data analytics platforms that use geospatial data from a variety of sources to provide analytics services to their customers. Many data analytics providers rely on partnerships with satellite imagery companies in order to source the data necessary to run their analytics platforms. We partner with a number of these companies to provide data for their platforms for certain use \ncases while also providing analytical tools and services directly to our own customers. We believe these relationships are advantageous to us over the long-term, as they enable new opportunities.\nOur Public Benefit\nWe believe that Planet’s data, products and services are valuable tools for responding to critical global challenges, informing more ecologically and socially sound decision-making, and measuring and reporting the results. As we grow our business, we will continue to scale our efforts to work with NGOs, philanthropies, governments, intergovernmental bodies, civil society groups, journalists, scientists, and others to make sure that our data is made as widely accessible as possible to inform critical efforts in conservation, climate, public affairs, humanitarian response, and human rights.\nTo serve these goals, we operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation. Our mission and business model are tightly aligned with our public benefit purpose, which is to accelerate humanity toward a more sustainable, secure, and prosperous world by illuminating environmental and social change. We believe that the most impactful and profitable way to build our business is to ensure that this public benefit remains at the core of our company’s DNA in perpetuity — informing and driving what we create for planet Earth and all its inhabitants.\nOur People\nWe are a passionate team of creative individuals that solve hard problems and strive to make an impact every day. We invest in a culture of learning, teaching, and dialogue, work together to deliver insight to our customers, bring our all, own our mistakes, and build for the future. We aim to identify, recruit, retain, incentivize and integrate our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants, because we believe our people are our most important assets. \nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a total of approximately 970 employees, including approximately 810 full time employees, working across 30 countries worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, though in some countries our employees may be subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements as a matter of law. We have not had any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nWell-being\nOne of our top priorities is to maintain the health and well-being of our employees and their families. To achieve this goal, we offer robust and comprehensive health, welfare and retirement benefits for our employees, including medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts (FSA) and health savings accounts (HSA), life insurance, short- and long-term disability, paid time off, various voluntary programs, parental assistance, tuition and work from home reimbursements, a robust employee assistance program (EAP) and a 401(k) retirement plan. We also conduct employee satisfaction surveys at least annually, in addition to feedback cycles.\nMany of our employees work remotely and we have adopted internal policies around flexibility, work from home expenses, and extra time off. To encourage flexible working and better work-life balance, we maintain a soft-closing policy during certain times of the year, and have adopted a “flex-Friday” policy which gives all of our employees one extra Friday off almost every month. We also conduct virtual meditation and yoga classes and other well-being programs throughout the year.\nCompensation and Advancement\nTo ensure a compelling total rewards philosophy and practice, we have policies in place to monitor and deliver fair and equitable compensation to employees based on their role, contribution, and performance. In addition, we offer eligible employees equity awards to align their contribution to the Company with a share in our financial success.\nOur employees and the people we are seeking to hire value growth and development. We provide opportunities to grow and develop through work experiences, mentorship programs, personal development experiences, training and tuition reimbursement. To help our employees navigate their careers, we also maintain a job architecture program, \nwhich we believe creates transparency about career development within our organization and helps facilitate discussions around career growth. \nCommitment to Fair, Equal, and Supportive Employment Practices\nWe are committed to establishing and maintaining a workplace culture and environment that values and promotes equal employment opportunities, that is free of harassment and hostility, and that enables our employees to bring their whole selves to work. We believe that a strong, dynamic workplace only exists under these circumstances, and where our resources are empowered to share their values and perspectives, challenge themselves with new ideas, and think critically on difficult questions. We advance open communication and other creative strategies across our company. \nOur Intellectual Property\nOur IP portfolio includes patents covering novel features of our spacecraft, trademarks identifying our company and various products, copyright ownership of the imagery archive, and trade secrets related to manufacturing and operations. We own the copyrights for the imagery captured by our spacecraft. These images measure in the millions per day and are unregistered. We occasionally will license imagery under the Creative Commons for promotional purposes, but otherwise imagery is licensed pursuant to commercial license agreements. We treat our know-how in the design, manufacture, and operation of spacecraft, ground based data relay, image processing, analysis and platform systems to be proprietary.\nSeasonality\nVarious factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between reporting periods, including factors affecting customer behavior, buying patterns and usage-based contracts. For example, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results due to the timing of contract awards and renewals and the timing of global events that may increase customer usage of our data services such as weather changes, natural disasters or other global events, or when commodity prices are at certain levels.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur industry is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of satellite technology. Additionally, we contract with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities. We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. The laws and regulations governing our business and operations, including the distribution of satellite imagery, and the development, production, and deployment of our satellite systems, may change in the future. Our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected if we are required to alter our business operations to comply with such changes or if our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis is reduced or restricted due to increased U.S., E.U. or other government regulation. This risk is heightened by the geopolitical relevance of our data, which can shed light on sensitive operations around the globe. However, based on information available to us, we don’t expect that our continued compliance with current government regulations, including environmental regulations, will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. For more information about the regulations affecting our business and the related risks, see \"Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\" in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\".\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on December 15, 2020, under the name dMY Technology Group, Inc. IV, a blank check company (“dMY IV”). On December 7, 2021, we consummated a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) with Planet Labs Inc.

These risks include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n•our limited operating history;\n•our history of losses and uncertainty about future profitability;\n•the evolution of the markets for our products;\n•our ability to compete effectively in intensely competitive markets;\n•our ability to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner; \n•our ability to manage our international operations; \n•our ability to successfully produce, launch, commission, operate and maintain our satellites and our customers’ and related infrastructure on suitable timelines to our customers;\n•the impact of satellite and infrastructural related failures; \n•our ability to develop new products and enhancements that achieve market acceptance;\n•our reliance on contracts with large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governmental entities;\n•the impact of disruptions in the U.S. government’s operations and funding; \n•our partial dependency on partnerships and resellers of our imagery;\n•the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, including trade tensions and tariffs;\n•our reliance on a limited number of suppliers and our ability to establish new supply relationships; \n•our ability to price our products and services effectively; \n•our ability to hire, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel;\n•the effectiveness of actions to develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities;\n•issues in the use of AI in our business; \n•the impact of climate change;\nRisks Related to Our Cyber Security, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\n•our or our third-party service providers ability to protect against cybersecurity related attacks; \n•our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n•any legal proceedings or claims against us relating to our intellectual property;\n•our use of open source software;\n•our use of data relating to individuals;\n•our policies regarding customer confidential information;\nRisks Related to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters\n•our ability to raise capital; \n•changes in tax rules and regulations;\n•our ability to use our net operating losses;\n•the accuracy of our key metrics, and assumptions and estimates used to calculate them;\n•changes in accounting standards that may cause adverse financial reporting fluctuations;\n•the accuracy of our estimates and judgments related to our critical accounting policies; \n•changes in our investment portfolio;\n•exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\n•our ability to operate in a highly regulated industry and obtain and maintain required government licenses and other authorizations and obtain and maintain required government licenses and other authorizations;\n•our ability to adapt to legislative and regulatory changes that affect our business\n•our ability to comply with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual;\n•our ability to comply with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws;\n•our ability to comply with international trade and governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n•failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations;\nAdditional Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities and Operating as a Public Company\n•volatility of the trading price of our securities; \n•the multi-class structure of our common stock;\n•securities or industry analysts changing their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock;\n•anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents and the exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation; and\n•our status as a Delaware public benefit corporation. \nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. You should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainty frequently encountered by growth stage companies in rapidly evolving markets. We have not achieved profitability, and we may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in future periods.\nFurther, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our platform, increased competition, changes to technology, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. We have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described below. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business, operating results and financial condition could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we intend to continue to invest in our business. As a result, we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe generated net losses of $123.2 million, $140.5 million and $162.0 million for our fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,203.0 million. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will generate enough revenue to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also intend to continue to invest in our business, including with respect to the development of our platform and satellites, and general administration, including, legal, finance and other compliance expenses related to our business. Increased expenses associated with these activities could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend significant funds to further develop our platform, build and launch additional satellites, expand our data analytics capabilities, increase our sales force to enter into new verticals, and expand use cases and integrations, amongst other things, and to consider strategic acquisitions, which may cause us to incur significant acquisition costs. We will also face increased compliance costs associated with growth, the expansion of our customer base, and operation as a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, or the rate of our growth in revenue may be slower than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications or delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of our business may significantly decrease.\nIf the market for our products and services fails to grow as we expect or takes longer than we expect to grow, or if our current customers or prospective customers fail to adopt our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for satellites, satellite imagery and related analytics products and services, in particular, continues to evolve, and the market for our data or our satellites may not be as significant as we expect. Further, the number of customers that we believe may be interested in our satellites analytics products and services may be less than we anticipate. We cannot be sure that we will be able to convert interest in our satellites, analytics products and services into sales, that these markets will continue to grow or, even if they do grow, that businesses will adopt our platform. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to further penetrate the existing market for satellites, Earth imaging and related data analytics. Our ability to further penetrate this market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our satellites, our platform and our proprietary data. We have spent, and intend to keep spending, considerable resources to educate potential customers about analytics products and services in general and our platform in particular. However, we cannot be sure that \nthese expenditures will help our platform achieve any additional market acceptance. In addition, it may take substantial time, potentially longer than we initially forecast or anticipate, to bring on new customers or for existing customers to purchase new products or offerings we may have. Furthermore, potential customers could have made significant investments in alternative satellites, platforms or services, or may not be persuaded that our proprietary data is needed for their business or operations. If the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect or businesses fail to adopt our platform, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThere is increasing competition from commercial entities and governments in our markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and we expect competition to continue to increase, in particular from other commercial entities and governments that operate in our markets and offer competitive products. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:\n•the size and diversity of our customer bases;\n•the timing and market acceptance of products and services, including the developments and enhancements to those products and services, offered by us or our competitors;\n•customer service and support efforts;\n•sales and marketing efforts;\n•ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors; and\n•our brand strength relative to our competitors.\nOur products and services compete with satellite and aerial imagery and related products and services offered by a range of private and government providers. Existing private competitors include Airbus Defense and Space, BlackSky technology, Inc., ImageSat International N.V., Maxar Technologies Ltd., Satellogic S.A., CG Satellite, foreign governments including India, South Korea, Taiwan and others that sell their data commercially, as well as aggregators of imagery and imagery-related products and services, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. In addition, we compete against a number of manned and unmanned aerial providers of high-resolution imagery, whose offerings provide certain benefits over satellite-based imagery, including better resolution and accuracy. In addition,  the U.S. government, the European Commission, and other governments have developed, constructed, launched and begun to operate their own imagery satellites, and may further enhance such imagery satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on commercial suppliers. For example, the United States provides free access to Earth imagery through Landsat and MODIS, and the European Commission provides free access to Earth imagery through the  Copernicus program and the Sentinel satellites. If the United States and/or the European Commission expand these programs, or if other governments begin to sell or provide free Earth imagery from satellites in the commercial markets, the value of our imagery may be further diluted. Further, foreign governments have in the past subsidized and may continue to subsidize the development, launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors and/or encouraged and may continue to encourage them to undercut prices, including the prices we offer for our data. Such increased competition from government entities or the commercial entities they subsidize could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nMany of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences. For example, if our competitors are able to build a competing fleet of satellites that is larger than our fleet, a potential that is heightened by the fact that we may keep our fleet at its current size for the near term, or that has greater capabilities than our fleet, we may be unable to attract or retain customers. These competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we have. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. Also, our competitors may have long-established relationships as preferred providers with various commercial entities and governments in our markets. We may fail to convert or retain customers if competitors are able to develop superior offerings or if they are able to offer similar offerings at a lower price point, including offerings that allows for use of other data to achieve similar methodological results. These factors could attract customers away from our services \nand reduce our market share, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWith the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. The emergence of new remote imaging technologies or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, particularly when combined with AI-based solutions, may compete with our products and services and may make our data analytics solutions less valuable to current or potential customers. To compete effectively against such products and services, we must continue to develop and provide customers with solutions that enable them to derive compelling value from our satellite imagery compared to what may be available from other providers.\n\nIn addition, the increase in launch vehicle development along with frequent and routine transport access to space, as well as the new fleets of satellites from companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon/Kuiper, may lower barriers to entry and further increase risk of competition or such companies may decide to compete directly.  Such competitors’ offerings could be more advanced than ours, or they may be able to offer services at lower prices than ours. Due to competitive pricing pressures the average selling price of our products and services may further decrease. If we are unable to offset decreases in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our product mix, our revenue and operating margins may decline, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or obtain renewals and expansions from our existing customers, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur continued growth depends, in part, on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers. Numerous factors, however, may impede our ability to add new customers, including our failure to attract, effectively train, retain, and motivate sales and marketing personnel, our failure to develop or expand relationships with third parties, our inability to convert initial usage into ongoing utilization of our platform, products and services, and our failure to successfully deliver our products or services and provide quality customer support once delivered. \nOur success also depends, in part, on our customers renewing their subscriptions when existing contract terms expire, and our ability to expand our relationships with our existing customers. The majority of our revenue is generated by licensing arrangements with our customers that grant them the right to use imagery and related data that are delivered digitally through our online platform, in addition to providing related services. Imagery licensing agreements vary by contract but generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms. The data licenses are generally purchased via a fixed price contract either on a subscription or usage basis, whereby a customer pays for access to our imagery that may be downloaded over a specific period of time or, less frequently, on a transactional basis, whereby the customer pays for individual content licenses.\nOur customers generally have no obligation to renew or expand their licensing agreements with us, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may decide not to renew their agreements with a similar contract period or at the same prices or terms or may decide to downgrade their subscriptions. Further, our government customers have broad discretion to unilaterally terminate, modify or suspend our contracts with them, as further discussed below in “—A meaningful portion of our business depends on sales to governmental entities and is subject to the policies, priorities and regulations of such governmental entities, and changes to which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and business prospects.”\nOur customer retention or our customers’ use of our platform and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our platform and our customer support, our subscription and usage-based model, the prices, features, or perceived value of competing offerings, changes to our offerings, or general economic conditions. For example, our customers rely on our customer support personnel to resolve issues and realize the full benefits that our platform and our products provide. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our subscriptions and products to existing and new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could suffer.\nIn addition, uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including as a result of inflationary pressures, currency exchange rate fluctuations, geopolitical conflicts, tariffs and retaliatory measures, and high interest rates \nmay result in longer and unpredictable sales cycles, could result in potential customers deciding not to contract with us or current customers deciding not to renew, could cause delays in renewal, upgrade, or expansion decisions for some of our existing customers, may reduce the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and could reduce the duration of their agreements with us. In addition, these situations could result in increased customer churn, a lengthening of our sales cycle with some of our potential customers, or reduced contract value with prospective or existing customers. Further, governmental changes in the United States, including changes to regulation, legislation, policy and/or spending, could affect our ability to acquire, retain or expand our U.S. government or other customers, as further discussed below in “—We operate in a highly regulated industry and government regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell our services, may increase the expense of such services or otherwise limit our ability to operate or grow our business.”\nA significant component of our growth strategy is to expand our relationships with our customers by increasing their adoption of our products and services, including Planet Monitoring, Planet Tasking, Planet Archive, Planet application programming interfaces (“APIs”), Planet Basemaps, Planet Fusion, Planet Analytic Feeds and Planetary Variables, that we sell to existing and new customers. However, we may not be successful in doing so if our customers find our additional solutions to be unnecessary or unattractive. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in improving existing solutions as well as developing and acquiring additional solutions, which resources may not be recovered if we are unable to successfully cross-sell these solutions to customers using one or more of our existing solutions. Any failure to sell additional solutions to current and future customers could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our customers do not renew, upgrade, or expand their subscriptions, defer their subscriptions to a later date, renew their agreements with us on less favorable terms, or fail to increase adoption of our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe will need to continue to maintain or improve our Net Dollar Retention Rate to support our growth, and our ability to expand our relationships with customers may require more sophisticated and costly sales efforts. If our customers’ renewals or expansions fall below expectations, and as a result our Net Dollar Retention Rate decreases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. \nOur international operations create business and economic risks that could impact our financial results.\nWe have limited experience in managing operations outside the United States. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in other countries successfully, our business and operations may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n•political, social and/or economic instability, including geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions and any sanctions or heightened controls that result from such conflicts;\n•risks related to export control laws and other governmental regulations applicable to transactions involving non-U.S. persons or foreign jurisdictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and enforcement;\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n•difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations and subsidiaries;\n•different regulations and practices with respect to employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain international jurisdictions;\n•compliance with statutory equity requirements; \n•increased costs related to tariffs; and\n•management of tax consequences.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of global operations successfully, our financial performance and operating results could suffer. For example, our sales, marketing and other operations in Europe, or any other international jurisdictions, now or in the future, are subject to U.S. export control regulations and may subject us to \nadditional regulatory regimes, laws, and taxes for which compliance may result in increased costs, expense, and devotion of management time and resources. Significant changes in U.S. trade policy, including further expansion of U.S. export/imports controls and tariffs, and retaliatory actions by other countries, may materially and adversely affect our business.\nFurther, given the global scope of our Earth imaging capabilities and the associated data collected, it is probable that certain governments, state actors or large businesses, among other powerful entities, may object to our operations and the collection of this data. For example, we have used our constellation of satellites and platform to capture and analyze images of missile silos and human rights abuses in foreign countries, among other things that may be sensitive to certain entities. If a government, state actor, large business or other similar entity were to object to the data captured by our operations, they may successfully drive regulators to curtail our operations, or even suspend our operations, and such objections and related media coverage may harm our reputation and prospects. Additionally, our platform and data may be used, without our prior knowledge or consent, by parties in political or social conflicts, including in armed conflicts. Such use of our data in those situations could materially harm our reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, our satellites, satellites operations infrastructure, archived data, information technology and communications systems, and other related systems, may have already been or could be in the future compromised by cyber-attacks or other incursions by such entities as a result of the sensitive information we capture and provide. Additionally, we conduct business in countries where due to the global political and economic climate, such business relationships may be viewed as negative or such business relationships may become difficult to maintain, all of which could adversely affect our brand and our reputation and, as a result, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on the successful production, launch, commissioning and/or operation of our satellites and related infrastructure, which is subject to many uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur research and development objectives focus on the development of our satellites, some of which we sell to customers, and our products and services. Our next generation satellites are still in development and may not be completed on time or at all and the costs associated with them may be greater than expected. While we estimate the gross costs associated with designing, building and launching our satellites will be significant, there can be no assurance that we will complete this on a timely basis, on budget or at all. Design, manufacture and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to delays and cost over-runs. If we do not complete development of these satellites in our anticipated timeframes or at all, our ability to meet customer requirements and to grow our business will be adversely affected. The successful development, integration, and operations of our future and current satellites and our future and current products and services involves many uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n•timing in finalizing satellite design and specifications;\n•performance of satellites and our space system meeting design specifications;\n•failure of satellites and our space system as a result of technological or manufacturing difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters;\n•engineering and/or manufacturing performance failing or falling below expected levels of output or efficiency;\n•increases in costs of materials or our ability to obtain required supplies and materials;\n•changes in project scope;\n•our ability to obtain additional applicable approvals, licenses or certifications from export control and other regulatory agencies, as required, and maintaining current approvals, licenses or certifications;\n•performance of our manufacturing facilities despite risks that disrupt productions, such as natural disasters, catastrophic events or labor disputes;\n•the impact of any satellite demise upon re-entry, including any components or debris that may not fully demise, and our ability to perform de-orbit maneuvers upon re-entry;\n•performance of a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and supplied components, the accuracy of supplier representations as to the suitability of such raw materials and supplied components for our products, and their willingness to do business with us;\n•our ability to adapt to changes in laws or regulations, and interpretations thereof, that affect our business;\n•performance of our internal and third-party resources that support our research and development activities;\n•our ability to protect our intellectual property critical to the design and function of our satellites and our products and services;\n•our ability to continue funding and maintaining our research and development activities;\n•our ability to successfully acquire or integrate potential technologies or businesses;\n•successful completion of demonstration missions; and\n•the impact of macroeconomic factors, including those related to national and global health concerns, on us, our customers and suppliers, and the global economy.\nIf any of the above events occur, they could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to continue to develop, integrate and operate our satellites and related infrastructure, products and services, and could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience a number of issues, such as delayed launches, launch failures, failure of our satellites to reach their planned orbital locations, significant increases in the cost of satellite launches, and insufficient capacity available from satellite launch providers. Any such issue could result in the loss of our satellites or cause significant delays in their deployment, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in launching satellites are common and can result from satellite manufacturing delays, unavailability of reliable launch opportunities with suppliers, launch supplier schedule delays, delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals and launch failures. If we do not meet our satellite manufacturing schedules, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the satellites are ready to be launched. We also share launches with other satellite manufacturers who may cause launch delays that are outside of our control. There are a limited number of launch suppliers, which may heighten the foregoing risks to the extent any of such launch suppliers changes their terms or otherwise experiences capacity constraints. In addition, launch vehicles or satellite deployment mechanisms may fail, which could result in the destruction of any satellites we have in such launch vehicle or an inability for the satellites to perform their intended mission. Launch failures also result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need to manufacture replacement satellites, which typically takes up to six months or longer, and to obtain another launch opportunity, and may impact the timing of future launches. If we are required to replace a satellite that was damaged during launch, we may bear some or all of the costs of manufacturing replacement satellites, which could result in lost revenue and contractual penalties. Further, the cost of satellite launches, launch insurance rates and launch-related services may significantly increase in the future, which could make it much more costly, potentially prohibitively more costly, for us to launch and deploy our satellites. Any launch failure, underperformance, delay, or increase in the cost of satellite launches or related services, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nIf our satellites fail to operate as intended, are destroyed or otherwise become inoperable, our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully could be materially and adversely affected and customers could be encouraged to seek alternative solutions even if less adequate.\nOur satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are exposed to severe environmental stresses during launch and in space that could affect our satellites’ performance. Hardware component problems in space could lead to deterioration in performance or loss of functionality of a satellite, with attendant costs and potential revenue losses if they impact our Earth imaging capabilities or ability to distribute such imaging. In addition, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite’s performance. Exposure of our satellites to an unanticipated catastrophic event such as a failed launch, a meteor shower, geomagnetic solar storms, unpredictable solar weather or atmospheric density, a collision with space debris, intentional or unintentional kinetic, radiation or blinding interference, other directed energy or similar attacks, have from time to time also reduced, and could in the future reduce, the performance of, or completely destroy, the affected satellites.\nWe cannot assure you that our satellites will continue to operate successfully in space throughout their expected operational lives. Even if a satellite is operated properly, technical flaws in that satellite’s sensors or other technical deficiencies or anomalies could significantly hinder its performance, which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered, or may be subject to large deductibles. Further, the actual orbital \nmaneuver lives of our satellites may be shorter than we anticipate, and we may be required to reduce available capacity on our satellites prior to the end of their orbital maneuver lives.\nWe may suffer a partial or total loss of a deployed satellite or experience other problems with our satellites that may reduce their performance or reduce the useful life of our satellites to shorter than expected. During any period of time in which a satellite is not fully operational, we may lose most or all of the revenue that otherwise would have been derived from that satellite. In addition, we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. Further, it can take up to six months or longer to manufacture new satellites and significant additional time to secure and launch such replacement satellites. As a result, if our satellites fail to operate as intended, are destroyed or otherwise become inoperable, it could take a significant amount of time to get the replacement satellites in orbit. During this period of time, our operations could be materially impaired with little we could do to alleviate the issue. Our inability to repair or replace a defective satellite or correct any other technical problem in a timely manner could result in a significant loss of revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced in the past and may continue to experience failures or disruptions of ground operations infrastructure or interference with our satellite signals, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate an extensive ground infrastructure, including over a dozen ground stations maintained by third parties. These ground stations are used for controlling our satellites and downloading imagery to eventually be provided to our customers. We may experience a partial or total loss of one or more of these facilities due to natural disasters (tornado, earthquake, flood, hurricane or other natural events), fire, acts of war or terrorism or other catastrophic events. A failure at any of these facilities could cause a significant loss of service for our customers. Additionally, we may experience a failure in the necessary equipment at our satellite control center, at any relevant back-up facility, or in the communication links between these facilities and remote teleport facilities. A failure or operator error affecting tracking, telemetry and control operations might lead to a breakdown in the ability to communicate with one or more satellites or cause the transmission of incorrect instructions to the affected satellites, which could lead to a temporary or permanent degradation in satellite performance or to the loss of one or more satellites. Intentional or non-intentional electromagnetic or radio frequency interference, including by nation-state actors or their agents, could result in a failure of our ability to deliver our services to our customers. We have experienced a variety of these equipment and communications failures from time to time, resulting in impacted services. A failure at any of our facilities or in the communications links between our facilities or interference with our satellite signal could cause our revenues to decline materially and could adversely affect our ability to market our services and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. \nIf we are unable to develop and release platform and service enhancements and new products and services to respond to rapid technological change, or to develop new designs and technologies for our satellites, in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for our platform is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, changes in satellite design and technologies, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. If the market does not perceive our service offerings to be of high quality, if we fail to introduce new and improved products and services, or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received by the market, we may not be able to attract or retain customers. If we are unable to attract new customers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if we suffer attrition among customers, our revenue may decrease, and our operating results will be adversely affected. \nDesigning and building satellites and developing analytics products and services, as well as deploying software updates, are inherently complex and technologically demanding endeavors. Due to this complexity, it can take a long time and require significant research and development expenditures to develop and test new or enhanced satellites and software updates, as well as data analytic products and services. In addition, the complexity of developing and deploying new satellites and data analytic products and services makes it difficult for us to predict how long it may take for such updates to our platform to be ready and available to be sold to customers. As a result, the amount of time it takes to develop such updates could be substantially longer than we initially anticipated. \nThe success of any enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new products and services depends on several factors, including timely completion, successful manufacturing and deployment of the satellites needed to capture the relevant data, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with existing technologies and our platform, and overall market acceptance. We cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing, marketing, and delivering on a timely and cost-effective basis enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new products and services that respond to technological change or new customer requirements or demands, nor can we be sure that any enhancements or improvements to our platform will achieve market acceptance. Any new satellites and data analytic products and services that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, or such data or data analytic products may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue. The introduction of new data analytic products and enhancements, as well as the development and deployment of new satellites, require a substantial outlay of capital and could also increase costs associated with customer support and customer success as demand for these services increase. This increase in cost could negatively impact our profit margins, including our gross margin. Moreover, even if we introduce new products and services, we may experience a decline in revenue, gross profit and gross margin of our existing products and services that is not offset by revenue from the new products or services. Further, we may make changes to our platform that customers do not find useful and we may also discontinue certain features or increase the price or price structure for our platform. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor’s products and services rather than migrate to our new products and services. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends, in part, on sales to large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governmental entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may make our sales cycle, forecasting processes, and deployment processes more difficult to predict, require greater time and expense or negatively impact our business.\nSales to large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governmental entities involve risks that may lengthen our sales cycle and make forecasting and deployment processes more difficult to predict. In addition, as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, political and economic instability, global logistic challenges and high inflation, many large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governments have reduced or delayed technology or other discretionary spending, which, in addition to resulting in longer sales cycles, may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. As we have sought to increase our sales to large enterprise customers and U.S. and foreign governments, we have also faced more complex sales procurement requirements, regulations, substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales than we do with smaller customers. With larger organizations, the decision to subscribe to our platform frequently requires the approvals of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization and, accordingly, sales to larger organizations may require us to invest more time educating and preparing for these potential customers. With U.S. and foreign governments, the decision to purchase our products and services or subscribe to our platform often requires approvals from multiple governmental agencies as well as compliance with stringent rules and regulations, which require us to employ regulatory and procurement experts and engage outside experts to help facilitate applicable governmental approvals and to comply with applicable rules and regulations. In addition, large enterprises, as well as U.S. and foreign governments, often require extensive configuration, integration services, and pricing negotiations, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment. Purchases by large enterprises, as well as U.S. and foreign governments, are also frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, which means we may not be able to come to agreement on the terms of the sale to them. Moreover, large enterprises may be directly impacted by various macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, interest rate fluctuations and financial market volatility, which may result in a decrease of spending by these large enterprises, including a decrease in spending on our products and services, and consequently reduce our revenue and impact our financial condition.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully sell our platform to large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governments is dependent on us attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience in selling to such large organizations. The opportunities to sell to large enterprises and U.S. and foreign governments are often awarded through competitive bidding processes. If we are unable to increase sales of our platform to large enterprise customers and U.S. and foreign governments while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, if we fail to realize an expected sale from a \nlarge customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected for a particular period or in future periods.\nA meaningful portion of our business depends on sales to governmental entities and is subject to the policies, priorities and regulations of such governmental entities, and changes to which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and business prospects.\nAn increasing and meaningful portion of our revenue is generated from agreements with the U.S. and other government customers, and, as a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected by shifts in the political environment and resulting changes in policy or budgetary priorities. We cannot be certain that current levels of government funding for our products and services will continue, or that such funding will be accessible consistent with expected timelines due to budgetary review activities and potential freezes on or cancellation of various governmental programs. \nOur contracts with government customers subject our business to the statutes and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the government, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and agency supplements. The FAR governs all aspects of government contracting, including contractor qualifications and acquisition procedures, and also contains provisions that give the government many rights and remedies which are unfavorable to contractors and not typically found in commercial contracts. Additionally, if a government were to object to certain of our operations (for example, the capturing of certain sensitive imagery), it is possible that the government could modify or reduce its business with us, and our contracts with certain government customers could, for example, be terminated for convenience, as further described below. These rights and remedies allow government customers, often with broad discretion relative to commercial contracts, among other things, to:\n•unilaterally terminate, and often to unilaterally modify (including reduction of orders), contracts for its convenience, and in that event, we may fail to realize the full value of such contracts;\n•terminate for default, which may make us liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source; \n•for contracts subject to the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act, reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not current, accurate, and complete; \n•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders or decline to exercise options on multi-year contracts; \n•claim rights in solutions, systems, or technology produced by us, appropriate such work-product for their continued use without continuing to contract for our services, and disclose such work-product to third parties, including other government agencies and our competitors, which could harm our competitive position; \n•prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency due to a finding of an organizational conflict of interest or contractor non-responsibility;\n•suspend our performance pending the outcome of a bid protest filed by a competitor and may also require us to resubmit offers for the contract or the government could terminate, reduce, or modify of the awarded contract; \n•suspend or debar us from receiving future government contracts; and \n•control, limit or prohibit the export of our products, intellectual property or services. \nIn addition, government contracts normally contain requirements that may increase our costs of doing business and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include:\n•unique disclosure and accounting requirements, such as Cost Accounting Standards; \n•government audits and investigations that may result in liability or price adjustments, recoupment of government funds, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from doing business with the government;\n•public disclosures of certain contract and company information; \n•socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and environmental compliance requirements; \n•additional cybersecurity requirements; and\n•requirements to procure (or not procure) certain materials, components and parts from specific countries or supply sources, including compliance with the Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act. \nEven where we are successful in obtaining a government contract, we may encounter bid protests from unsuccessful bidders. Bid protests could result, among other things, in significant expenses to us, contract modifications, or even loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and, as a result, delay the recognition of revenue.\nAs a prime contractor to the U.S. government, from time to time we rely upon subcontractors to perform work under government contracts. We are responsible for our subcontractor’s work, even though in some cases we have limited involvement in that work. If one or more of our subcontractors fails to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis or violates U.S. government contracting policies, laws or regulations, our ability to meet contract requirements may be compromised. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. Conversely, in some cases we act as a subcontractor to other entities that are prime contractors to a government entity, which likewise makes us subject to risks related to such entity's performance.\nNew regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current requirements, or interpretations thereof, could increase our costs and risk of non-compliance. In addition, if we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and contract requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under our contracts, the Federal Civil False Claims Act (including treble damages and other penalties), or criminal law. In particular, the Federal Civil False Claims Act incentivizes private individuals, including present and former employees, to notify the U.S. government of potential violations by contractors. Any resulting penalties, fines, suspension, or damages could adversely affect our operations, financial results and business prospects. \nOur role as a contractor to agencies and departments of the U.S. government results in our being routinely subject to investigations, audits and reviews relating to our information provided in our government contract bids and proposals and contractor registrations, as well as compliance with our government contracts and related laws and regulations, which may be conducted without our knowledge. Adverse findings in these investigations, audits and reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and we could face civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation and competitive position if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true. Responding to any investigation, audit, review or allegation could result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. If our reputation or relationship with U.S. government agencies were impaired, or if the U.S. government otherwise ceased or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, it would adversely affect our operations, financial results and business prospects. \nDisruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nA meaningful portion of our revenue is generated from U.S. and other government customers. In the current U.S. political environment, there is significant uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and policy throughout the government. Policy changes, shifts in international and trade relations, budget uncertainty, shifting funding priorities, U.S. government shutdowns or the need to operate under continuing resolutions, the failure of the U.S. government to manage debt, the failure of the U.S. government to approve budgets, and/or or other disruptions to federal government operations could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, reduction in contract scope, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nIf we are not successful in maintaining and expanding the interoperability of our products with third-party products and services, our business, financial position, and operating condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe competitive position of our platform depends in part on its interoperability with products and services of third parties. As such, we must continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in hardware, software, networking, and database technologies. In the future, one or more technology companies may choose not to support \nthe operation of their hardware, software, or infrastructure, or our platform may not support the capabilities needed to operate with such hardware, software, or infrastructure. In addition, to the extent that a third party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may choose not to support our platform. We intend to facilitate the compatibility of our platform with various third-party hardware, software, and infrastructure by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nThe competitive position of our products also depends on the availability of third party data sets and imagery, as well as the ability to use our products with third party data sets and imagery, which allows customers to integrate multiple data sets and conduct valuable analyses. As such, we must continuously design software to ensure our products’ compatibility with third party imagery. Further, many customers or potential customers seek AI-enabled solutions, and as a result, we expect our ability to continue to develop or partner with providers of AI solutions that interoperate with our platform will impact our ability to drive future growth and compete effectively If we fail to anticipate our customers’ integration needs, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, if third party data sets which we do not control, and some of which are publicly sourced, become unavailable or unreliable for any reason, to us or our customers who integrate such data into our platform, it may negatively impact our ability to develop or deliver products that use such data and customer satisfaction with our products and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely impacted. \nOur revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our products fail to meet contractual requirements or our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner.\nWe sell proprietary data that is generated through our technologically advanced fleet of satellites and further analyzed with our proprietary platform analytics, and also sell satellites to a limited number of strategic customers. Sophisticated software, including software developed by us, may contain defects that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we manufacture or purchase from third parties. Most of the satellites and systems we have developed must function under demanding and unpredictable operating conditions and in harsh and potentially destructive environments. In addition, we contract with third-parties, which we do not control, to provide services in connection with the launch into orbit of our satellites, adding further risks to our ability to perform under contracts with our customers, including those that rely on our satellites to gather data.\nWe employ sophisticated design and testing processes and practices, which include a range of stringent factory and on-site acceptance tests with criteria and requirements that are jointly developed with customers. Our systems may not be successfully implemented or operate or give the desired output, or we may not be able to detect and fix all defects in the satellites, hardware and software we utilize for the data we sell or resolve any delays or availability issues in the launch services we procure. Failure to do so could result in increased costs, lost revenue and damage to our reputation and may adversely affect our ability to win new contract awards.\nDue to environmental and other factors, including those described elsewhere in this section, we may be unable to deliver imagery for the locations, responsiveness and quality requested by customers and therefore fail to meet contractual requirements. Failure to do so may require us to cancel the contracts and result in lost revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are partially dependent on resellers of our imagery and partnerships for a portion of our revenue. If these resellers or partners fail to market or sell our products and services successfully, our business would be harmed.\nWe partially rely on resellers and partners to market and sell our products and services. Our resellers and partners may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our products and services, or may have competing interests that negatively affect their sales of our products and services. If we fail to enter into reseller agreements on a timely basis or if our resellers and partners fail to market and sell our imagery products and services successfully, these failures could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDownturns or volatility in macroeconomic conditions and/or uncertainty in the political environment could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur revenue, gross margin, and ability to achieve and maintain profitability depend significantly on macroeconomic conditions. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets, including current global economic conditions and consumer trends, have in some cases led to lower demand for our platform and data offerings, and any adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions that may occur in the future, including any recession, economic slowdown or disruption of credit markets, could further exacerbate such effects.\nAdditionally, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including adverse global and domestic economic conditions resulting from national or global health concerns or other trends, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Specifically, additional factors that could have an impact on the demand for our platform and data offerings include worldwide or regional recession, increased unemployment, fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, tariffs, changes to international trade control laws or regulations, failures of banks and financial institutions or other liquidity concerns at such financial institutions, changes in taxation, energy prices, supply chain disruptions, high interest rates, and other similar macroeconomic factors. Additionally, the demand for our platform and data offerings may be affected due to financial market volatility, negative financial news, energy shortages or cost increases, labor costs, and other economic factors. Such a shift would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, any disruption in the credit markets could impede our access to capital. If we have limited access to additional financing sources, we may be required to defer capital expenditures or seek other sources of liquidity, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. \nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for critical supplies and services, and for research, development, manufacturing and launch of our satellites, which could in turn harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of any one or more of these suppliers or their failure to supply us with the necessary supplies or services on a timely basis could cause delays in our research, development or satellite manufacturing and adversely affect our business.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers that are able to design and build the components we need to manufacture our satellites. We also utilize a number of key service providers for research and development purposes. There are also a limited number of suppliers able to launch our satellites, including NewSpace India Limited (Indian Space Research Organization), ArianeSpace SA, Rocket Lab USA Inc., Firefly Aerospace Inc., ISAR Aerospace Technologies Inc., and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Increased tariffs on our suppliers’ products are expected to increase the cost of manufacturing and deploying our satellites. Also if any of our suppliers’ or service providers’ businesses fail or their products become subject to additional tariffs, it would reduce competition and could increase the cost of manufacturing and deploying our satellites, conducting research and development and launch services. Adverse events with respect to any of our component suppliers, service providers or launch providers could also result in the delay of the design, construction or launch of our satellites. General economic conditions may also affect the ability of our suppliers, service providers and launch providers to provide services on commercially reasonable terms or to fulfill their obligations in terms of manufacturing schedules, launch dates, pricing, or other items. Even where alternate suppliers for such services are available, we may have difficulty identifying them in a timely manner, we may incur significant additional expense in changing suppliers or service providers, and this could result in difficulties or delays in the design, construction or launch of our satellites. Any delays in the design, construction or launch of our satellites could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, or import ineligibility for our products or product components, or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to establish supply relationships for necessary components and may be required to develop alternative relationships with different component suppliers, which could delay the introduction of our products, increase the costs for components more than anticipated, and negatively impact our business.\nWe purchase components for the manufacturing of our satellites from third party suppliers and depend on those suppliers to deliver to the contracted specifications in order for us to maintain and grow our fleet of satellites and offerings. We may experience difficulties if these suppliers do not meet their obligations to deliver and support this equipment or if they are unable to supply the required components for new satellite designs, on time, at certain prices, of certain quality, or at all. If such suppliers are unable to supply the required components, we will need to engage in new supply relationships. Given the technical and sophisticated nature of the components we utilize, there is a limited number of suppliers we could use. Further, making such a change in suppliers could take time and could result in us having increased costs or force us to make design changes that impact other components or capabilities of the satellites. As a result of the foregoing, any change in supply relationships could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and pricing structures for our products and services, which may impact our financial results.\nWe expect that we may need to change our pricing model from time to time, including as a result of competition, global economic conditions, reductions in our customers’ spending levels generally, changes in product mix, pricing studies or changes in how data analytics are employed by organizations. Similarly, as we introduce new products and services, or as a result of the evolution of our existing products and services, we may have difficulty determining the appropriate price structure for our products and services. In addition, as new and existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, or revise their pricing structures, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, as we continue to target selling our products and services to larger organizations, these larger organizations may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, we may be required from time to time to revise our pricing structure or reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFor example, we generally establish fixed price subscription contracts for our imaging services, the revenue for which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, based on usage by customer over time, or to a lesser degree, up front based on transfer of access to the imagery to the customer. We have also entered into a long-term manufacturing and services contract to sell satellites and related services and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. If we fail to accurately forecast the cost of such contracts, especially for those contracts with unlimited downloads, or long-term manufacturing and hardware delivery obligations, if we fail to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the terms of the contract or if we fix the price for some projects too low for the services we ultimately provide, we could adversely affect our overall profitability and/or revenue opportunity, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, hire, retain and train other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel and management team. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of management as well as our engineering, marketing, sales, and product development personnel, could lead to a loss of expertise as well as disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, the maintenance and development of our platform requires individuals with significant experience in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering and software engineering. Further, our ability to successfully execute strategic initiatives, such as expanding our salesforce, will be dependent on our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of individuals with the appropriate capabilities and level of experience. If we do not succeed in attracting, retaining and motivating highly qualified personnel or maintaining export licenses to support needed for the work of non-U.S. personnel, our business may be seriously harmed. Further, we also face significant competition for employees, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located, and as a result, skilled \nemployees in this competitive geographic location can often command higher compensation and may be difficult to hire. We have in the past, and may in future, lose a number of employees as a result of one or more employees leaving and encouraging others to join them. If this were to occur again, it could seriously harm our business.\nAs we become a larger company, we may find our recruiting efforts more challenging. The incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees provided by our equity compensation or by future arrangements, such as through cash bonuses, may not be as effective as in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or retaining or motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nFurther, given our reliance on stock-based compensation, any volatility in stock price may impact our ability to retain and attract top talent over time given the competition for strong talent within technology organizations, or could result in additional compensation related expenses and greater dilution to our current stockholders.\nWe believe our long-term value as a company benefits from continued growth, which may, at times, negatively impact our profitability.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and demand for our services since inception as a result of our focus on growth. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings places a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We are required to manage multiple relations with various large customers, suppliers, regulatory authorities and other third parties. In the event of further growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our computer systems, procedures or internal controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may not be able to manage any such growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform.\nWe must expand our sales and marketing organization to increase our sales to new and existing customers. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, particularly our direct enterprise sales organization focused on sales to the world’s largest organizations. It may require significant time and resources to effectively onboard new sales and marketing personnel, and an increasingly remote workforce could result in less effective, more operationally complicated, or lengthier onboarding processes. We also plan to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs that are focused on these large organizations. Once a new customer begins using our platform, our sales team will need to continue to focus on expanding consumption with that customer. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts generate increases in revenue that are smaller than anticipated. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.\nWe have substantial customer concentration, with a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues and accounts receivable.\nSignificant portions of our revenue and accounts receivable are concentrated with a limited number of customers. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, one customer accounted for 19% of revenue. As of January 31, 2025, one customer accounted for 12% of accounts receivable. Further, accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are thus subject to the increased risk of us being unable to collect on overdue amounts.\nWhile we intend to increase the number of customers using our platform, we believe it is possible that our revenue and our operating results in the near term will continue to depend on sales to a small number of customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our revenue could fluctuate materially and could be materially and disproportionately impacted by decisions of these customers or any other significant customer to cancel their \nagreements with us or otherwise no longer use our services. In addition, if we are unable to diversify our customer base, we will continue to be susceptible to risks associated with customer concentration.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonality in our business and fluctuations in our operating results due to usage-based contracts.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonality in our business and fluctuations in our operating results due to usage-based contracts. For example, we typically have customers who increase their usage of our data services when they need more frequent data monitoring over broader areas during peak agricultural seasons, during natural disaster events, or when commodity prices are at certain levels. These customers may expand their usage and then subsequently scale back. We believe that the seasonal trends that we have experienced in the past may occur in the future. To the extent that we experience seasonality, it may impact our operating results and financial metrics, as well as our ability to forecast future operating results and financial metrics. Additionally, when we introduce new products to the market, we may not have sufficient experience in selling certain products to determine if demand for these products is or will be subject to material seasonality.\nTechnological developments or other changes in our industry could render our satellites, or any of their components, less competitive or obsolete, which may seriously harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and evolving customer demands. These technological developments require us to integrate new technology into our satellites. Our competitors may develop or acquire alternative and competing technologies, which could allow them to create new and disruptive imaging satellites or other associated technology. The risk from the introduction of superior competing satellite technologies is particularly exacerbated in our industry as it can take months to years to deploy any new satellites. As a result, if any technological change or change in customer demands renders our satellites or products obsolete or insufficient, even if we are able to develop and deploy new technologies to compete and meet such demands, it would take substantial time until such satellites are operational. As a result of the foregoing, we may need to invest significant resources in research and development to maintain our market position, keep pace with technological changes and customer demands and compete effectively. Our failure to improve our satellites in a timely manner may seriously harm our business. In addition, if the components we use to manufacture our satellites were to become obsolete due to technological change or other factors, it could lead to inventory obsolescence, which may lead to inventory impairment charges. Further, it takes significant time to manufacture new components and if any of our inventory were to become obsolete, it would take a while before we could build new satellites. This delay in building new satellites could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely upon third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure to host our products. Any disruption in the operations of these third-party providers, limitations on capacity or interference with our use could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource substantially all of the infrastructure relating to our cloud-accessible products to third-party hosting services. Our cloud-based products depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted by third-party hosting services by maintaining its configuration, architecture, features and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers, which is transmitted by third-party internet service providers. Any limitation on the capacity of our third-party hosting services could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of our existing customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any incident affecting our third-party hosting services’ infrastructure may be caused by human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events, including events related to climate change. For more information, see “—We are subject to a series of risks related to climate change.” A prolonged service disruption affecting our cloud-based solution for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the third-party hosting services we use.\nIn the event that our service agreements with our third-party hosting services are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or \ndamage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud solution for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on a strong brand. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to retain or expand our base of customers will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the “Planet” brand is critical to expanding our base of customers and current and future partners. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain the “Planet” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our continued ability to provide high quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nIn addition, we receive, and our customers’ use of our products and services receives, a high degree of media coverage, including social media coverage, around the world. If such media coverage presents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information regarding Planet, or if our current or potential customers have negative reactions to such media coverage, such coverage could damage our reputation in the industry and with current and potential customers, employees, and investors, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a series of risks related to climate change.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Certain of our facilities, as well as our and third-party infrastructure on which we rely, are located in areas that have experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, various meteorological phenomena (such as drought, heatwaves, wildfire, storms, and flooding, among others) or other catastrophic events that may disrupt our or our suppliers’ operations, require us to incur additional operating or capital expenditures, or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Climate change may increase the frequency and/or intensity of such events. For example, in certain areas, there has been an increase in power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Climate change may also contribute to various chronic changes in the physical environment, such as sea-level rise or changes in ambient temperature or precipitation patterns, which may also adversely impact our or our suppliers’ operations. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risk. For example, to the extent catastrophic events become more frequent, it may adversely impact the availability or cost of insurance.\nAdditionally, we expect to be subject to risks associated with societal efforts to mitigate or otherwise respond to climate change, including but not limited to increased regulations, evolving stakeholder expectations, and changes in market demand. Changing market dynamics, global and domestic policy developments, and the increasing frequency and impact of meteorological phenomena have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our suppliers and/or customers, or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nInterruption or failure of our infrastructure or loss of our data storage due to a natural catastrophic event such as a pandemic, earthquake, fire, or flood, or a man-made problem such as a power disruption, computer virus, data security breach, terrorism or war, could hurt our ability to perform our daily operations effectively and provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, power shortages, public health epidemics or pandemics, terrorism, political unrest, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change and other events beyond our control. For example, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, occurring at our headquarters, at one of our other facilities, or at a facility where one of our launch partners is \nlocated or where our third-party suppliers’ facilities are located could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our satellites, satellites operations infrastructure, archived data, information technology and communications systems, and other related systems. Any downtime, damage to or disruption or failure of our systems as a result of a natural disaster or man-made problem could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm or disrupt our systems. We do not currently maintain a back-up production facility from which we can continue to collect, process and deliver imagery in the event of the loss of our primary capabilities. In the event we are unable to collect, process and deliver imagery from our primary facilities, our daily operations and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ground stations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, cyber-attacks or other intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events, including events related to climate change. Such attacks or other bad acts could come from individuals, companies, rogue groups, terrorist organizations, governments, or affiliated actors. This risk is heightened by the geopolitical relevance of our data, which may expose globally the sensitive operations of such entities. This is especially true with respect to countries known or suspected to have actively carried out offensive operations on their own. Further, climate change has increased, and may continue to increase, the rate, size, and scope of natural disasters. For more information, see “—We are subject to a series of risks related to climate change.” In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions to our operations or the operations of suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, or customers, which could affect our ability to maintain launch schedules or fulfill our customer contracts. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, if our infrastructure, information technology and communication systems do not scale effectively with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of such systems could be adversely affected.\nOur satellites may not be able to capture Earth images due to weather, natural disasters or other external factors, or as a result of our constellation of satellites having restrained capacity.\nOur satellites may not be able to capture Earth images, either with sufficient clarity or detail, or at all, due to the occurrence of a variety of factors including cloud cover, smog, adverse weather conditions including hurricanes or tornadoes, dust storms, fog, fires or volcano eruptions, or other factors that are outside our control. Certain of these events may become more frequent or intense as a result of climate change. For more information, see “—We are subject to a series of risks related to climate change.” Further, if there is high demand on our constellation to capture images in a certain area, we may have difficulty tasking sufficient satellite coverage to capture high-resolution images in another region. As a result of the foregoing, customers may not be able to procure images they want, which could adversely affect our relationship with such customers and our general reputation.\nWe may be subject to certain risks as a mission-driven company, including stockholder activism.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our mission to use space to help life on Earth, by imaging the whole world and making global change visible, accessible, and actionable. This mission is a significant part of our business strategy and who we are as a company. However, we may make decisions regarding our business and products in accordance with our mission and values that may reduce our short- or medium-term operating results if we believe those decisions are consistent with the mission. Although we expect that our commitment to the mission will, accordingly, improve our financial performance over the long term, these decisions may not be consistent with the expectations of investors and any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the time frame we expect or at all, which could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nAs such, we may in the future be subjected to litigation by those that disagree with aspects of our mission or features of our platforms that we have developed in support of our mission, as well as stockholder activism by investors who disagree with the management of our business. Responding to these actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our management. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with such activities could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategic plan, retain customers and \nskilled employees and affect long-term growth. In addition, such activities may cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions that do not necessarily reflect our business operations.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nLimited insurance coverage and availability may prevent us from obtaining insurance to cover all risks of loss.\nWe intend to insure certain satellites in our constellation and certain manufacturing risks, inventory and launches to the extent that insurance is available at acceptable premiums. This insurance will not protect us against all losses to our inventory and satellites due to specified limitations, exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations, and it may be difficult to insure against certain risks, including a partial deterioration in satellite performance and satellite re-entry.\nAlthough we intend to obtain and maintain insurance for our inventory, operating satellites and certain launches, any determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market, regulatory requirements, the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites. Higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs and consequently reduce our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. If the terms of on-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all. Even if obtained, our on-orbit operations insurance will not cover any loss in revenue incurred as a result of a partial or total satellite loss.\nOur financial results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, our key metrics discussed elsewhere in our public filings, and other metrics that analysts use to evaluate our business, have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and other key metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. If we fail to meet these expectations for any particular period, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below:\n•the impact of an economic downturn or market volatility, including downturn caused by national and global health concerns, geopolitical tensions, inflation or high interest rates, on our business and the businesses of our customers, prospective customers and partners;\n•our ability to attract new customers;\n•our customer renewal and adoption rates, and our ability to expand use of our platform by existing customers;\n•the timing and rate at which we sign agreements with customers, including the impact of cost reduction measures, delayed purchasing decisions or prolonged sales cycles at prospective or existing customers as a result of the effects of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors outside of our control;\n•the contract value of agreements with customers;\n•fluctuations in revenue associated with customer contracts that are consumption-based;\n•the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n•the timing of recognition of revenue;\n•the amount and timing of operating expenses;\n•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n•the timing and success of new product features, updates, and enhancements by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n•a significant portion of our revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract with the customer, with some contracts’ terms being several years long and, as a result, any downturn or upturn in sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations;\n•the size and nature of some of our contracts can make estimation of total revenues and costs at completion complicated and subject to many variables\n•the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers, including greater unpredictability in our customers’ willingness or ability to timely pay for subscriptions to our platform as a result of the geopolitical tensions, inflation or high interest rates;\n•the timing of expenses related to the development or possible acquisition and integration of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets from acquired companies;\n•our ability to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to grow and support our business and operations;\n•network outages, technical difficulties or interruptions affecting the delivery and use of our platform or actual or perceived security breaches or incidents;\n•any adverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\n•our ability to attract and/or retain talent necessary to the successful delivery of our business objective, including maintaining export licenses to support the work of non-U.S. personnel;\n•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to government spending;\n•the effects of national and global health concerns; \n•the effects of acts of terrorism, war, political instability or other geopolitical conflicts, both domestically and internationally, as well as any trade sanctions or resulting geopolitical tensions, changes in laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, or the imposition of economic or trade sanctions or tariffs affecting international commercial transactions; and\n•general economic, industry, market and geopolitical conditions and uncertainty, both domestically and internationally.\nOur past and future acquisitions will require significant management attention. Our acquisitions could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies, and these acquisitions could pose challenges or risks. In this regard, we have made strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of the BlackBridge group of companies in September 2015, the Terra Bella business from Google in April 2017, Boundless Spatial in March 2019, VanderSat in December 2021, Salo Sciences in January 2023, and Sinergise in August 2023. We do not know if we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or successfully integrate any acquired business, operate it profitably or retain its key employees, customers, partners or vendors. Integrating any newly acquired business, product or technology could be expensive and time-consuming, could disrupt our ongoing business and financial performance, and could distract our management. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets, technologies and employees from any acquired business, our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. Any integration process will require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. Further, any debt we incur to complete an acquisition could result in increased fixed obligations and include certain covenants that could impede our ability to manage our operations. Alternatively, if we use equity to finance any acquisitions, it could dilute our current stockholders. We may become liable for certain unforeseen pre-acquisition liabilities of an acquired business, including, but not limited to, successor liability for actions or noncompliance of an acquired business prior to such acquisition.\nIssues in the use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning and computer vision (together, “AI”), in our geospatial data and analytics platforms may result in reputational harm or liability.\nAI is enabled by or integrated into some of our and our third-party partners’ geospatial data and analytics platforms and is a growing element of our business offerings. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users of our systems could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. If the analyses that AI applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical or regulatory issues. If we or our third-party partners enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial or illegal because of their purported or real impact on society, governments, the socio-political climate, our financial condition and operations or the financial condition and operations of our customers, we or our customers may experience competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm.\nOur customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.\nWe derive revenue principally from licensing rights to use imagery that is delivered digitally to our customers through our online platform. Our imagery licensing agreements vary by contract, but generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms. If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. The risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief, including as a result of the impacts and disruptions caused by national and global health concerns or other global events, and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Cyber Security, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience, or are unable to protect against, cyber-attacks, ransomware, security incidents, or security breaches, or if unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers’ data, our data, or our platform, then our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our platform and operations may be disrupted, we may become unable to meet our service level commitments, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform and products may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities or additional expenses which may not be covered by existing cyber insurance.\nWe collect, receive, store, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, share, and otherwise process personal information, export-controlled information, confidential information and other information, including proprietary and sensitive information, in order to provide our service, to operate our business, for legal and marketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. We rely significantly on third-party service providers and sub-processors to support our operations and to help us deliver services to our customers. These third parties may store or otherwise process personal information and other information on our behalf.\nSecurity breaches or incidents, cyber-attacks or unauthorized access to our systems, platform, or products, or the systems of our third-party service providers, could lead to interruptions and other disruptions to our platform and other aspects of our operations, damage or unauthorized access to, or the loss, destruction, unavailability, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or other processing of, our or our customers’ data, and claims, demands, disputes, and litigation made or initiated by governmental authorities and private parties, investigations and other proceedings initiated by governmental authorities indemnity obligations, fines, penalties, and other liabilities. We have previously been and may in the future become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties, including by third parties that may seek unauthorized access to our or our customers’ data or to disrupt our ability to provide our services. In addition, many of our employees work remotely, which may pose additional data security risks.\nWhile we have taken steps to protect the confidential and personal information that we have access to, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers that store or otherwise process certain data on our behalf, including certain of our and our customers’ data, could be breached or otherwise compromised or we or such service \nproviders could suffer damage or unauthorized access to, or loss, destruction, unavailability, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or other processing of, our data or third-party data we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process, including customer data. Our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is limited. Cyber-attacks, ransomware and other malware, viruses and other malicious code, employee and contractor mistakes, errors, or malfeasance, social engineering (including spear phishing attacks and certain attacks seeking to deploy malware on systems), supply chain attacks, and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, particularly against cloud services. If our security measures are or are believed to have been breached or otherwise compromised, or if we or any of our third-party service providers suffers or are believed to have suffered a security breach or incident, or if any data we or such service providers maintain or otherwise process is, or is believed to have been, damaged, accessed without authorization, or subject to loss, destruction, unavailability, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or other processing, whether as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, malfeasance, or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. \nWe use third-party technology, systems, and services in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, storage of our imagery, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, credit card processing, and other functions. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent data loss and other security breaches and incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party service provider, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not otherwise be effective. There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. \nMany different security vulnerabilities exist and exploits of such vulnerabilities continue to evolve, and we may be unable to anticipate cyberattacks and other means of attempting or effectuating security breaches or incidents, identify or detect any breach or incident, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative measures. Among other things, our applications, systems, networks, software, or physical facilities could be breached or otherwise compromised, or the personal, confidential, or export-controlled information that we store or otherwise process could be subject to unauthorized acquisition or other processing or otherwise compromised, due to employee error or malfeasance, if, for example, third parties fraudulently induce our employees or our members to disclose information or user names and/or passwords, or otherwise compromise the security of our networks, systems and/or physical facilities. Additionally, employees or service providers have in the past and may in the future inadvertently misconfigure resources or systems, or misdirect certain communications, in manners that lead to security incidents.\nThird parties may also conduct attacks designed to deny customers access to our services or otherwise disrupt our platform or other aspects of our products, services, and operations. Third parties, including nation-state actors or their agents, may also conduct attacks designed to gain control over our systems, data and satellites. These and other cybersecurity risks we face may be heightened by conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas, respectively, and other geopolitical events. Further, these risks are heightened by the geopolitical relevance of our data, which may expose globally the sensitive operations of individuals, companies, rogue groups, terrorist organizations, governments, or affiliated actors. This is especially true with respect to countries known or suspected to have actively carried out offensive operations.\nAlso, the use of AI technologies may result in security incidents and our use of AI technologies may create additional cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks, including risks of security breaches and incidents. Further, AI technologies may be used in connection with certain cybersecurity attacks and may increase the intensity or effectiveness of such attacks or otherwise create heightened cybersecurity risks. For more information, see “—Issues in the use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning and computer vision (together, “AI”), in our geospatial data and analytics platforms may result in reputational harm or liability.\nThe costs to respond to and otherwise address a security breach or incident and/or mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these matters may not be successful, and these matters could result in interruptions, delays, disruptions, and cessation of systems and our services, negative publicity, harm to our reputation, and other harm to our business and our competitive position. For example, the SEC has adopted rules for mandatory disclosures of cybersecurity incidents suffered by public companies and cybersecurity governance and risk management. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices in response to a security breach or incident or related regulatory actions or claims, \ndemands, or litigation (or in anticipation of a potential claim of breach or violation of laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations, or of regulatory action or litigation), any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, any security breach or other security incident, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform, the reliability of our imagery, and damage to our brand, reduce demand for our products and services, disrupt our platform and other aspects of our business operations, cause us to fail to meet our service level commitments, require us to spend material resources in efforts to investigate or correct the breach or incident and in efforts to prevent future security breaches and incidents, expose us to legal proceedings and liabilities, including litigation, regulatory enforcement, and indemnity obligations, result in our customers terminating contracts with us, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for fines, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, attorney fees, or other impacts that arise out of security breaches or incidents or privacy violations or related matters. A privacy or security breach or incident or actual or asserted privacy violation, or the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand, grow our customer base, and use, store, transmit, and otherwise process increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, we may fail to enter into all necessary agreements, and even if entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. We have filed applications for certain aspects of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property and proprietary rights, third parties may challenge intellectual property and proprietary rights held by us, pending and future copyright, trademark and patent applications may not be approved, and we may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. Our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the United States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing on our intellectual property rights. We have asserted, and in the future may continue to assert, our intellectual property rights against third parties. If the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our services and methods of operations. Any of these events would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated by licensing our intellectual property rights in our images to customers. We implement processes to ensure our customer agreements include the proper restrictions on how customers can use our images and related intellectual property rights. However, these processes may fail or customers may otherwise not comply with their contractual obligations limiting their rights to use or further exploit or disseminate our images, which could substantially reduce the value of our images and related intellectual property rights. Enforcing our intellectual property rights against customers that violate the terms of their license restrictions could be costly, time consuming, and may not always be effective. \nWe may be, in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation which are expensive to support, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on us.\nCompanies in technology industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and grow our business, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us will likely grow. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor, or that our employees, consultants, independent contractors, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. We may in the future be subject to litigation on the foregoing grounds or other grounds. The costs of supporting such litigation are considerable, and there can be no assurances that a favorable outcome will be obtained. We may be required to settle such litigation on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we may be a party fails to settle and we go to trial, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment which may not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or require the payment of substantial amounts to the other party. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party’s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense. Our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected as a result of the occurrence of any of the foregoing.\nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers, suppliers and other partners from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement of intellectual property rights. The scope of these indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. Any claim for indemnification by our partners could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we use open source software inconsistent with our policies and procedures or the license terms applicable to such software, we could be subject to demands to release portions of our source code, legal expenses, damages, or costly remediation or disruption to our business.\nWe use open source software in our platform. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures in place designed to govern our use of open source software, there is a risk that we may incorporate open source software with onerous licensing terms, including the obligation to make our source code available for others to use or modify without compensation to us, or inadvertently use open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. If we receive an allegation that we have violated an open source license, we may incur significant legal expenses, be subject to damages, be required to redesign our product to remove the open source software or publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, or be required to comply with onerous license restrictions, all of which could have a material impact on our business. Even in the absence of a claim, if we discover the use of open source software inconsistent with our policies, we could expend significant time and resources to replace the open source software or obtain a commercial license, if available. All of these risks are heightened by the fact that the ownership of open source software can be uncertain, leading to litigation, and many of the licenses applicable to open source software have not been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be construed to impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Any use of open source software inconsistent with our policies or licensing terms could harm our business and financial position.\nWe capture, store, use, and otherwise process data relating to individuals, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, and compliance or any failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store, and otherwise process personal information and other data, including data relating to individuals. There are numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy, data protection, and the retention, sharing, use, disclosure, protection, and other processing of personal information and other data relating to individuals, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with other laws, regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other actual or asserted obligations. \nWe also are subject to the terms of our own privacy policies and certain obligations to third parties, and may seek to comply with, or be asserted to be subject to, certain industry standards, industry codes of conduct, and other actual or asserted obligations, relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. These actual and asserted obligations may be inconsistent with each other and may conflict with other laws, regulations, or actual or asserted obligations, or our policies and practices. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws, regulations, and other actual or asserted obligations are often uncertain and may change over time. Further, the U.S. federal and state governments and agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulators, may in the future enact new legislation, modify existing laws and regulations, and promulgate new laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transmission, destruction, or other processing of personal data and other information, or security measures with regard to such information. \nNew or modified laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations, or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations, may add additional complexity, requirements, restrictions, and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to update compliance programs, may require additional facilities, resources, or practices, such as requirements to maintain or process data in certain jurisdictions, and could impact business strategies and the availability of previously useful data or certain means of using or otherwise processing such data. For example, several jurisdictions have adopted, or are considering adopting, restrictions on the resolution of satellite imaging, and these restrictions may change as technology and public awareness of potential privacy impacts evolve. We may find it necessary or appropriate to modify our services or related policies to address applicable laws, regulations, industry practices or standards, codes of conduct, or other actual or asserted obligations regarding the use, disclosure, security, or other processing of data, including data of our customers or others, including with respect to manners in which consent for the use, disclosure, or other processing of such data is obtained, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to do on commercially reasonable terms at all, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features and otherwise make use of data.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, our privacy policies, contractual or other actual or asserted obligations, including industry standards or codes of conduct, relating to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, or the protection, storage, use, retention, capture, or other processing of data, including personal information or other data relating to individuals, may result in claims, demands, and litigation by private parties, governmental inquiries, enforcement actions, and other proceedings, fines, penalties, or other liabilities, public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, a loss of trust in us by our customers, reduction in demand for our products and services, and other harm to our reputation and market position, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur policies regarding customer confidential information and support for individual privacy and civil liberties could cause us to experience adverse business and reputational consequences.\nWe strive to protect our customers’ confidential information and individuals’ privacy consistent with applicable laws, directives, and regulations. Consequently, we endeavor to not provide information about our customers to third parties without legal process. From time to time, government entities may seek our assistance with obtaining information about our customers or could request that we modify our platforms in a manner to permit access or monitoring. In light of our confidentiality and privacy commitments, we may legally challenge law enforcement or other government requests to provide information, to obtain encryption keys, or to modify or weaken encryption. To the extent that we do not provide assistance to or comply with requests from government entities, or if we challenge those requests publicly or in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences \namong certain customers, regulators, or portions of the public. Conversely, to the extent that we do provide such assistance, or do not challenge those requests publicly in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences from other customers, regulators, or portions of the public arising from concerns over privacy or the government’s activities.\nRisks Related to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters\nOur business is capital intensive and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate and grow our business.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows used in operations. We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. However, the implementation of our business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to developments in our business and opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of our preferred stock, supplemented by loans from financial institutions. No assurances can be given that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the future, or that we will not require additional equity or debt financing. In addition, if one of our satellite launches fails or if our satellites need to be replaced, there is no assurance of insurance recovery or the timing thereof and we may need to exhaust or significantly draw upon our available debt facilities or obtain additional financing. If we determine we need to obtain additional funds through external financing and are unable to do so, we may be prevented from fully implementing our business strategy.\nThe availability and cost to us of external financing depend on a number of factors, including our financial performance and general market conditions, including any impact of national or global health concerns, inflation or high interest rates, bank and financial institution stability or other global events that may have on general market conditions or the capital markets specifically. Declines in our expected future revenues under contracts with customers and challenging business conditions faced by our customers are among the other factors that may adversely affect our credit and access to the capital markets. Other factors that could impact the availability and cost to us of external financing include the amount of debt in our current or future capital structure, activities associated with strategic initiatives, the health of our satellites, the success or failure of our planned launches, our expected future cash flows and the capital expenditures required to execute our business strategy. The overall impact on our financial condition of any transaction that we pursue may be negative or may be negatively perceived by potential lenders and may result in less access to the capital markets. Long-term disruptions in the capital or credit markets as a result of uncertainty or recession, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital. A deterioration in our financial performance or general market conditions could limit our ability to obtain financing or could result in any such financing being available only at greater cost or on more restrictive terms than might otherwise be available and, in either case, could result in our deferring or reducing capital expenditures including on new or replacement satellites. In addition, sustained or increased economic weaknesses or pressures or new economic conditions may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions and/or the development, design, acquisition and construction of new satellites. We cannot predict with any certainty whether or not we will be impacted by economic conditions. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.\nWe cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new tax legislation, whether in or out of the United States, or could otherwise have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nAs a multinational business, we are subject to income and other taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes to tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws or regulations, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and reduce our cash flow from operating activities, and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, other factors or events, including business combinations and investment transactions, changes in stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in available tax credits, changes in transfer pricing methodologies, other changes in the apportionment of our income and other activities among tax jurisdictions, and changes in tax rates, could also increase our effective tax rate. Our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We may also be liable for taxes in connection with businesses we acquire. Our determinations are not binding on the IRS or any other taxing authorities, and accordingly the final determination in an audit or other proceeding may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our tax provisions, accruals and returns. An assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could harm our business.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes for our products in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nSales and use, value added, goods and services, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Our customers can be located in one jurisdiction, utilize our products through our network equipment in a different jurisdiction, and pay us from an account located in a third jurisdiction. This divergence, along with the jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction variance in tax laws, causes significant uncertainty in the tax treatment of our business. There is further uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient physical presence or nexus for a national, state, or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet, and there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our network and products as not taxable in certain jurisdictions will be accepted by national, state, and local taxing authorities. In determining our tax filing obligations, management has made judgments regarding whether our activities in a jurisdiction rise to the level of taxability. These judgments may prove inaccurate, and one or more states or countries may seek to impose additional sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us. It is possible that we could face sales tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as state and other tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes on our network and products could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage customers from purchasing our network and products, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating losses, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nAs of January 31, 2025, our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled $564.9 million, of which $259.2 million will expire at various dates through 2038 and $305.7 million will not expire. Additionally, as of January 31, 2025, we have state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $364.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively. U.S. federal net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs is limited to 80% of current year taxable income.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or income tax. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation’s equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (many of which are outside our control). If it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we undergo one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock then we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating losses prior to their expiration, even if we were to achieve profitability. To the extent we are not \nable to offset future taxable income with our net operating losses, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nCertain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using internal company data that has not been independently verified or data from third-party attribution partners. While these metrics and figures are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics and figures across our worldwide client base and user base. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics and other figures to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we may discover material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for calculating these metrics may be updated from time to time and may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate similar metrics and figures. We may also discover unexpected errors in the data that we are using that resulted from technical or other errors. If we determine that any of our metrics or figures are not accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics or figures. Any real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and other figures could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nIf our judgments or estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in our public filings, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, or may in the future include, those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.\nDue to the size and nature of some of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues, timing of revenue recognition, and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different revenues and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, revised our estimates, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.\nOur cash equivalent and investment portfolio is invested with a goal of preserving our access to capital, and generally consists of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, U.S. government and U.S. government agency debt securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. However, volatility in the global financial markets can negatively impact the value of our investments. If financial markets experience volatility, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. Our investments are designated as available-for-sale and carried at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until the security is sold, the security has matured, or we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is not due to a credit loss. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro. We expect our non-U.S. operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are continually monitoring our foreign currency exposure to determine if we should consider a hedging program. Today, our non-U.S. contracts are denominated in either U.S. dollars or local currency, while our non-U.S. operating expenses are often denominated in local currencies. Additionally, as we expand our non-U.S. operations, a larger portion of our operating expenses may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar and decreases in the value of foreign currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of our revenues being lower.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and government regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell our services, may increase the expense of such services or otherwise limit our ability to operate or grow our business.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to various aspects of our business, including employment and labor, licensing, export, import, tax, privacy and data security, health and safety, communications, and environmental matters. Laws and regulations at the foreign, federal, state and local levels frequently change, especially in relation to new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably estimate the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future regulatory or administrative changes. In particular, our industry is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of satellite technology. The laws and regulations, and interpretations thereof, governing our business and operations, including the collection and distribution of satellite imagery and associated analytics and services, are likely to change in the future. Additionally, there are certain environmental risks involved in the operation of our ground stations, manufacturing of our satellites and potential for orbital debris. To the extent that governments impose restrictions or additional regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws, to address regulation of satellite technology, distribution of satellite imagery or services, or any environmental concerns regarding our business activities, we may be required to alter our business operations to comply with such changes. Our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis may also be reduced or restricted due to increased U.S., E.U. or other government regulations or other government actions. This risk is heightened by the geopolitical relevance of our data, which can shed light on sensitive operations around the globe, as well as the sensitive nature of our customer base, which include various government agencies. Moreover, we may face lawsuits or incur liability as a result of the imagery we make available through our products and services. In any of these cases, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. \nFailure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and/or adhere to regulatory requirements could result in service interruptions, regulatory scrutiny, civil penalties or forfeitures, private lawsuits, or the denial, suspension or revocation of licenses, certificates, authorizations or permits, any of which could prevent us from operating our business or could impede our business plan. The following list summarizes certain material regulatory approvals we need to maintain and the various regulatory requirements our satellite operations must adhere to, as well as certain impacts these regulatory approvals and requirements can have on our business and operations. Regulatory frameworks and our products evolve over time and thus additional material regulatory approvals could develop in the future.\nNOAA Approvals. Our business requires licenses from the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs\noffice of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (“NOAA”) Office of Space Commerce, and we currently hold various active licenses issued by NOAA for the operation of our equipment. License approval can include an interagency review of national security, foreign policy, and international obligations implications, including consultations with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of State. There can be no assurance that NOAA will renew the licenses we hold, accept necessary modifications to the licenses we currently hold, grant new licenses, or that coordination conditions can continue to be met. Moreover, the rules and regulations of NOAA, and their interpretation and application, may change, and NOAA may adopt regulations that impact our ability to collect imagery or otherwise limit or restrict our operations as presently conducted or currently contemplated. Under our NOAA licenses and NOAA rules and requirements, the U.S. government has the right to interrupt service or limit our ability to distribute satellite images when foreign policy or U.S. national security \ninterests are affected. Additionally, we must obtain NOAA approval for changes to material facts in our NOAA licenses. If NOAA revokes, modifies, or fails to renew the licenses we hold, or fails to grant a new license or modification in a timely manner, or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective licenses, we may not be able to continue to provide our products and services; should we not obtain necessary licenses or approvals in a timely manner, including as a result of recent reductions in the NOAA workforce, our products and services may not be competitive.\nCanadian Approvals. As a foreign operator of remote sensing system ground stations in Canada, we are required to obtain the relevant licenses from Global Affairs Canada (“GAC”). Should we not obtain necessary licenses or approvals in a timely manner or fail to maintain existing licenses or approvals, our products and services may be impacted. Distribution of SPOT imagery within Canada is subject to oversight by GAC. If any such imagery covers a restricted Area of Interest, it can only be provided to a “Five Eyes Government”, unless prior approval is obtained from GAC. GAC is under no obligation to grant such approvals and has sole discretion to alter the list of restricted Areas of Interest. \nExport Approvals. Planet’s satellite and ground station hardware, software, and related technology is controlled for export. Any export of hardware or software, and the provision of services and related technology, outside of the United States or to non-U.S. persons may be subject to U.S. and international export control laws and regulations including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). For additional information relating to trade control risks see “—We are subject to international trade laws and regulations that could impair our business operations and ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate applicable controls.” \nFCC Approvals. Our operation of satellites and U.S. ground terminals requires licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), and we currently hold various active licenses issued by the FCC for the operation of these facilities. The FCC regulates the launch and operation of our satellites, the use of the radiofrequency spectrum used by our satellites and the licensing of our ground terminals located within the United States. We are also subject to the FCC’s rules and regulations and the terms of our licenses, which require us to comply with various operating conditions and requirements. As conditions and requirements to our licenses, we are required to share spectrum with other users and to coordinate our spectrum use with other satellite operators, including certain agencies of the U.S. federal government, to avoid interference to or from other satellites. The results of coordination may adversely affect our use of our satellites using certain frequencies, as well as the type of applications or services that we can accommodate. Further, our radio frequency operations may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses. If we obtain a required authorization but we do not meet milestones regarding the construction, launch and operation of a satellite by deadlines that may be established in the authorization, we may lose our authorization to operate a given satellite. We believe our current operations adhere to FCC requirements. However, the FCC licenses we currently hold are subject to potential revocation, modification, or nonrenewal by the FCC. While the FCC generally renews licenses routinely, there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates on favorable terms or without adverse conditions. Failure to renew these licenses could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business as currently expected. Moreover, should we not obtain necessary licenses or approvals for new operations in a timely manner, we may not be able to expand our operations, products, and services. In addition, if we do not obtain required authorizations in the future, we may not be able to operate our existing facilities. We are subject to FCC regulatory fees associated with our authorizations which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. For example, in its fiscal year 2024 regulatory fee schedule, the FCC implemented several significant changes for fee payors in the space station (e.g., satellite) and earth station categories, including substantial fee increases that impact companies like ours. Such fee fluctuations or further increases could impact our financial flexibility and/or adversely affect our operations and ability to conduct business. Finally, the rules and regulations of the FCC, and their interpretation and application, may change, and such authorities may adopt regulations that impact our ability to collect imagery or otherwise limit or restrict our operations as presently conducted or currently contemplated, and these changes in rules or regulatory policy may significantly affect our business.\nOther International Registration and Approvals. The use of radio frequency spectrum for satellite communications and the use of orbital positions internationally is subject to the rules and requirements of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). Additionally, satellite operators must abide by the specific laws of the countries in which downlink services are provided from the satellite to ground terminals within such countries. The FCC has coordinated or is in the process of coordinating, the operations for each of our satellites pursuant to the ITU \nrequirements. Coordination of our satellites with other satellite systems is required by the ITU to help prevent harmful radio frequency interference from or into existing or planned satellite operations.\nPlanet or its vendors must secure necessary licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum in each country into which we will downlink commercial Earth imagery. If Planet or its vendors are not successful in obtaining the necessary approvals, we will not be able to downlink imagery in those foreign locations. Our inability, or our vendors’ inability, to obtain the necessary foreign licenses or authorizations could negatively affect our business. In addition, regulatory provisions in countries where we wish to operate may impose unduly burdensome restrictions on our operations. Our business may also be adversely affected if the national authorities where we plan to operate adopt treaties, regulations or legislation unfavorable to foreign companies.\nAdditional Regulatory Issues. Our launch and operation of planned satellites and ground stations may require additional regulatory authorizations from the FCC, NOAA, and/or a non-U.S. licensing authorities. Obtaining launch windows for planned satellites and ground stations, preparing for launch, and working with the requisite equipment in foreign jurisdictions may require additional coordination between us, our launch services providers, and/or various U.S. and foreign regulators. Failure to obtain these approvals may result in delays in launches of satellites or servicing of launched satellites, which in turn may materially affect our business. \nThe rules and regulations of these regulatory authorities are subject to change and may not continue to permit our operations as currently conducted or as we plan to conduct them. For example, the FCC recently adopted rules requiring the deorbiting of certain satellites – including those we may launch in the future – after five years to mitigate the risk of orbital debris. The FCC continues to consider the imposition of additional rules and reporting obligations that could affect us and our operations, including by requiring us to redesign our satellites, incur operational burdens, and/or assume increases in production and launch costs. Future rules may also affect other corporate policies or practices in ways that may create further burdens on our business and operations. Moreover, the United States and ITU are considering regulatory changes that may affect our use of or access to certain portions of the radiofrequency spectrum, possibly including reallocation of frequencies we use or intend to use or the introduction of new services that may cause harmful interference to our operations (such as X-band downlink in the 8025-8400 MHz band, which is under study in the United States and at the ITU for terrestrial use). Such authorities may also adopt rules and/or make changes in the licenses of our competitors that affect our spectrum access or use. Certain changes in rules or regulatory policy may significantly affect our business or raise the cost of operating our business. These changes could affect Planet’s operations, including by requiring us to redesign our satellites, incur operational burdens, and/or assume increases in production costs. In addition, some legislators have discussed vesting additional authority in the Commerce Department and/or NASA in certain areas related to our operations, which could result in additional regulatory burdens affecting us and our operations in a similar manner.\nIn addition, entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for the facility security clearance of our subsidiary, Planet Labs Federal, Inc., which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform services requiring access to classified information and information systems for the U.S. government.\nWe require certain facility and personnel security clearances to perform our classified U.S. government related business. A facility security clearance is required for a company to perform on classified contracts and subcontracts for U.S. government customers. Security clearances are subject to regulations and requirements including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (“NISPOM”), which specifies the requirements for the access to and protection of classified information.\nAs such, we must comply with the requirements of the NISPOM and any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations. If we, our employees or contractors were to violate the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations, Planet Labs Federal, Inc. could lose its facility security clearance. Further, obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process and it can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who hold or are able to obtain security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances \nterminate employment with us, our ability to perform classified work may be negatively affected, including the potential termination of a classified contract.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our facility security clearance. Failure to comply with the NISPOM or other security requirements may subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of the facility clearance, loss of U.S. government contracts, or potential suspension or debarment as a government contractor, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, we are limited in our ability to provide specific information about our classified work, associated risks, or any disputes or claims relating to such work. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified work than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the related risks.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws and similar laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, we will continue to engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to conduct our business, including marketing our products and obtaining necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents and third-party intermediaries, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions.\nWhile we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents and third-party intermediaries will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws, and allegations thereof, could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution or other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences, all of which could adversely impact our business, reputation, prospects and results of operations. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. \nWe are subject to international trade laws and regulations that could impair our business operations and ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate applicable controls. \nOur business is subject to international trade laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”); the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”); and trade and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and similar laws of other jurisdictions. \nInternational trade laws and regulations continuously evolve to address technological developments and changes in geopolitical conditions. Increasing global trade tensions could result in new regulations, tariffs or other governmental restrictions that inhibit our ability to transact with foreign suppliers, customers, or other business \npartners. Monitoring and responding to these developments may require significant resources and could impair our operations. If it was determined that we did not comply with such international trade laws and regulations or other similar laws, we could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations, the possible loss of our export or import privileges, seizure and forfeiture of assets involved in such noncompliance and debarment from U.S. government contracting. \nMoreover, changes to international trade laws and regulations may restrict our ability to conduct certain export activity or may impose export licensing requirements that could delay or increase costs associated with export activity. Obtaining any necessary export license for a particular export, including to foreign national employees of Planet, to ground station sites, to vendors, or to cover a sale or offering may not be possible, may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. If we are unable to maintain our existing authorizations, make necessary modifications to our existing authorizations, or obtain future export licenses in accordance with the export control laws and regulations, we may be unable to export hardware or software or provide services and related technology to our customers, suppliers, employees or other business partners, which could impair our business operations and ability to compete in international markets. \nFurthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions programs in many cases prohibit the export of software and services to certain sanctioned countries and persons, as well as for prohibited end-users and end-uses. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant applicable international trade laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties. \nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption software and technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute hardware and software or could limit our ability to provide or receive services. Because we use hardware and software that incorporate encryption functionality, we may be subject to certain of these provisions. \nAny limitation on our ability to export to or sell our technology, products, or services in international markets or to export controlled technology and software to our foreign national employees and/or non-U.S. subsidiaries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governments, including those regulators discussed above, and applicable laws and regulations evolve over time. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions or other collateral consequences. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. \nWe are also exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other improper activities by our employees, consultants, advisors and partners, as well as third parties that we may use from time to time to perform services or act on our behalf. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Specifically, it may be the case that one or more of such parties fail to adhere to our policies or violate applicable federal, state, local, and international laws, including but not limited to, those related to corruption, bribery, economic sanctions, insider trading and export/import controls. Despite the significant challenges in asserting and maintaining control and compliance by these parties, we may be held liable for such parties’ actions. Such liabilities may create harm to our reputation, inhibit our plans for expansion, or lead to extensive liability either to private parties or government regulators, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities and Operating as a Public Company\nThe price of our Class A common stock and warrants may be volatile.\nThe price of our Class A common stock, as well as any outstanding warrants, may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n•changes in the industries in which we and our customers operate;\n•any disruptions or delays in the launch and deployment of our satellites;\n•any damage or impairment to our constellation of satellites;\n•developments involving our competitors;\n•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n•variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general;\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n•publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n•the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n•actions by stockholders, including the sale of any of their shares of our Class A common stock;\n•short selling of our Class A common stock;\n•the publication of analyst or industry coverage or short seller reports regarding our business;\n•additions and departures of key personnel;\n•commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the combined company;\n•changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n•the volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;\n•general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of national and global health concerns, recessions, interest rates, inflation, local and national elections, the effects of bank or financial institution failures, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and corruption; and\n•acts of terrorism, war or political instability, both domestically and internationally, changes in laws and regulations, or the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and warrants, and securities of other companies in our industry, often without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation. In addition, the Business Combination resulted in our merging with a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), which can cause additional volatility in the price of our Class A common stock and warrants. There has also been increased focus by government agencies on transactions such as the Business Combination recently, and we expect that increased focus to continue, and we may be subject to increased scrutiny by the SEC, other government agencies and holders of our securities, as a result.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and warrants regardless of our operating performance. \nThe multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder, which will limit an investor’s ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nShares of our Class B common stock have 20 votes per share, while shares our Class A common stock have one vote per share. William Marshall and Robert Schingler, Jr. (the “Planet Founders”) hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, the Planet Founders hold over approximately 62% of the voting power of our capital stock and are able to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, many amendments of our organizational documents and many transactions involving a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction. Additionally, the Planet Founders received additional shares of Class B common stock for any contingent consideration issued in \nrespect of their ownership of Former Planet Class B common stock held immediately prior to the Business Combination. The Planet Founders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of Planet, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of Planet, and might ultimately affect the market price of shares of our Class A common stock. \nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or, if such analysts change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock can be influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide more favorable recommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future agreements and financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe may redeem the unexpired outstanding public warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to the warrant holders, thereby making their warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant; provided that the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption; provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise the redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders to (i) exercise the warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so, (ii) sell the warrants at the then-current market price when the holder might otherwise wish to hold onto such warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nWe also have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; provided that the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption; provided that certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of shares of Class A common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A common stock. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (i) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (ii) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of shares of Class A common stock received is capped at 0.361 shares of Class A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\nIn the event we determine to redeem the public warrants, holders of our redeemable warrants would be notified of such redemption as described in the Warrant Agreement, dated March 4, 2021, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Warrant Agreement”). Specifically, in the event that we elect to redeem all of the redeemable warrants as described above, the Company shall fix a date for the redemption (the “Redemption Date”). Notice of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by Planet not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date to the registered holders of the redeemable warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner provided in the Warrant Agreement shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the registered holder received such notice. In addition, beneficial owners of the redeemable warrants will be notified of such redemption via our posting of the redemption notice to the Depository Trust Company.\nIn addition, we may redeem the outstanding public warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of our Class A common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A common stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are “out-of-the-money,” in which case the holder would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of our Class A common stock had such holder’s warrants remained outstanding.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without warrant holder approval.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under the Warrant Agreement. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or to correct any defective provision or mistake, including to conform the provisions of the Warrant Agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the Warrant Agreement set forth in our public filings, (ii) adjusting the provisions relating to cash dividends on shares of common stock as contemplated by and in accordance with the Warrant Agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Warrant Agreement as the parties to the Warrant Agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of the public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nThe Warrant Agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nThe Warrant Agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the Warrant Agreement, including under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the Warrant Agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in the Warrant Agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the \nWarrant Agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of the Warrant Agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nDelaware law and provisions in our Charter and our Bylaws could make a takeover proposal more difficult.\nOur organizational documents are governed by Delaware law. Certain provisions of Delaware law and of our Certificate of Incorporation (“Charter”) and our bylaws (“Bylaws”) could discourage, delay, defer or prevent a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of Class A common stock held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n•the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n•the fact that we are a public benefit corporation, as discussed below;\n•certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n•advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; and\n•a multi-class common stock structure with 20 votes per share of our Class B common stock, providing the Planet Founders the ability to control the outcome of many matters requiring stockholder approval, even though the Planet Founders own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.\nThese anti-takeover provisions as well as certain provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Planet, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. If prospective takeovers are not consummated for any reason, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the price of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions that our stockholders desire. See “Description of Securities.”\nWe operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation. As a public benefit corporation, we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to balance our stockholders’ pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or benefits identified by our Charter. There is no assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purpose or that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, which in turn may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required, under Section 366 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) and pursuant to our Bylaws, to disclose to stockholders a report at least biennially on our overall performance in promoting the public benefit or benefits identified in our Charter and the best interests of those materially affect by our conduct and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose and in promoting those interests. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur Charter and our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our Bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered or intend to enter into with our directors and officers provide that:\n•we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law generally provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful;\n•we may, to the extent authorized from time to time by our board of directors, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n•we are required by our Bylaws to advance expenses, as incurred, to our present and former directors and officers in connection with appearing at, participating in or defending a proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor, except that such directors or officers must undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n•the rights conferred in our Bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n•we may not retroactively amend the provisions in our Bylaws to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents.\nWhile we have procured directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies, such insurance policies may not be available to us in the future at a reasonable rate, may not cover all potential claims for indemnification, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nOur Charter generally designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Court”) (and the other state courts and federal court located in Delaware) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain what such stockholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Planet or our directors, stockholders, officers or employees.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, any (i) derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders or employees to Planet or our stockholders; (iii) action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Charter or our Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time); (iv) action, suit or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court or (v) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or stockholders governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Delaware Court or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware. The exclusive forum provision described in the foregoing sentence does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Charter further provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring an interest in any shares of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the exclusive forum provisions in our Charter. These choice-of-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she or it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. We note that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce these provisions and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Charter inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nAs a public benefit corporation, the statutory obligation of our board of directors to manage Planet in a manner that balances our stockholders’ pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or public benefits identified in our Charter may negatively impact our financial performance and may subject us to increased derivative litigation concerning our directors’ obligation to balance these interests, the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur directors have a statutory obligation to consider not only the stockholders’ pecuniary interests, but also our specific public benefit and the best interests of other stakeholders materially affected by Planet’s actions. Under Delaware law, directors are shielded from liability for breach of these obligations if they make informed and disinterested decisions that are not such that no person of ordinary, sound judgment would approve. If a conflict between our stockholders’ pecuniary interests and the other interests enumerated above occur, our directors must balance such interests as they deem appropriate; thus, there is no guarantee such a conflict would be resolved in favor of our stockholders’ pecuniary interests, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nTherefore, we may take actions that our directors believe will be in the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our conduct or in the best interest of promoting our specific benefit purpose, even if those actions do not maximize our financial results. While we intend for this public benefit designation and obligation to provide an overall net benefit to us and our customers, it could instead cause us to make decisions and take actions without seeking to maximize the income generated from our business, and hence available for distribution to our stockholders. Our pursuit of longer-term or non-pecuniary benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all, yet may have an immediate negative effect on any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we may be less attractive as a takeover target than a traditional company would be and, therefore, your ability to realize your investment through an acquisition may be limited. Under our Charter, we cannot merge or consolidate with another entity if, as a result of such merger or consolidation, our capital stock would become, be converted into or exchange for the right to receive shares or other equity interests in corporation that is not a public benefit corporation or similar entity and the certificate of incorporation (or similar governing document) of such entity does not contain identical provisions to the language in our Charter identifying the public benefit or public benefits, unless the transaction receives approval from at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Additionally, public benefit corporations may also not be attractive targets for activists or hedge fund investors because new directors would still have to balance the stockholders’ pecuniary interests, the specific public benefit and the best interests of other stakeholders materially affected by the corporation’s actions, and stockholders can enforce this balancing obligation through derivative suits, subject to certain limitations under Delaware law. Further, by requiring the board of directors of public benefit corporations to consider additional constituencies other than maximizing stockholder value, Delaware public benefit corporation law could potentially make it easier for a board to reject a hostile bid, even where the takeover would provide the greatest short-term financial yield to investors.\nAs a Delaware public benefit corporation, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our board’s obligation to balance our stockholder’ pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct and our public benefit interest, the occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStockholders of a Delaware public benefit corporation with shares listed on a national securities exchange (if they, individually or collectively, own the lesser of at least two percent of the company’s outstanding shares or shares of the corporation with a market value of at least $2,000,000 as of the date the action is instituted) are entitled to file a derivative or other type of action to enforce the statutory balancing requirement imposed on the board of directors by the DGCL. This potential liability does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore, we may be subject to the possibility of increased litigation, which would require the attention of our management, and, as a result, may adversely impact our management’s ability to effectively execute our strategy. Additionally, any such litigation may be costly, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company involve significant expenses and require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from our business operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and demands on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to substantial additional costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying those or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it.\nIn addition, certain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. As such, our management team may not effectively or efficiently manage these obligations or constituents. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any material weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and accurately report timely financial information and, as a result, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions.\nSpecifically, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended and in accordance with public company standards or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could result in the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Further, the identification of a material weakness could result in regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs related to implementing an internal audit and compliance function to further improve our internal control environment.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require substantial financial and management resources.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or expresses an adverse opinion, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets or other sources of funds and our stock price may be adversely affected. \nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts, including a potential need to hire additional accounting and financial. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using these systems could adversely affect our controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention. In addition, we may discover weaknesses in our systems of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements.\nAny outstanding or potential stockholder litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are and may continue to be subject to stockholder litigation against us and we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Any such litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business or reputation.",
