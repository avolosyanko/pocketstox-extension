      "text": "Item 1.        Business\n    AGCO Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1991. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “AGCO,” “we,” “us” or the “Company” include AGCO Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nGeneral\n    We are a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural machinery and precision agriculture technology. We deliver value to farmers and Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) customers through our differentiated brand portfolio including leading brands Fendt®, Massey Ferguson®, PTx and Valtra®. Our full line of equipment, smart farming solutions and services helps farmers sustainably feed our world. We distribute most of our products through approximately 2,700 independent dealers and distributors in approximately 140 countries. We also provide retail and wholesale financing through our finance joint ventures with Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., which, together with its affiliates, we refer to as “Rabobank.” In 2024, we fundamentally shifted our portfolio through the PTx Trimble joint venture and the divestiture of the majority of our Grain & Protein (“G&P”) business.\n    On April 1, 2024, pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Sale and Contribution Agreement among AGCO, Trimble and PTx Trimble (the “Joint Venture”), AGCO and Trimble completed (i) the contribution by Trimble to the Joint Venture of Trimble’s OneAg business, which is Trimble’s agricultural business, excluding certain Global Navigation Satellite System and guidance technologies, and $8.1 million of cash, (ii) the contribution by AGCO to the Joint Venture of its interest in JCA Industries, LLC d/b/a JCA Technologies and $46.0 million of cash, and (iii) the purchase by AGCO from Trimble of membership interests in the Joint Venture in exchange for the payment by AGCO to Trimble of $1,954.0 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Immediately following the closing and as a result of the transaction, AGCO directly and indirectly owns an 85% interest in the Joint Venture and Trimble owns a 15% interest in the Joint Venture. AGCO began consolidating PTx Trimble within its consolidated financial statements on April 1, 2024. We believe PTx Trimble creates a global-leading mixed-fleet precision agriculture platform. We are the exclusive provider of the comprehensive technology offering, supporting the future development and distribution of next-generation agriculture technologies, allowing us to offer a wide variety of user-friendly technologies compatible across brands, equipment models and farm types. The acquired hardware, software and cloud-based applications span all aspects of the crop cycle, from land preparation to planting and seeding to harvest. Refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for further information.\n    On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement to sell the majority of its G&P business, which includes the GSI®, Automated Production® (AP), Cumberland®, Cimbria® and Tecno® brands for a purchase price of $700.0 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. On November 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Company’s G&P business to A-AG Holdco Limited, an affiliate of American Industrial Partners. The divestiture of the G&P business aligns with AGCO's efforts to better position itself for high margin growth and allows for AGCO to better streamline and focus on its portfolio of agricultural machinery and precision ag technology products.

PTx combines precision ag technologies from the cornerstones of AGCO's tech stack: Precision Planting® and its newest joint venture, PTx Trimble. AGCO's PTx technologies enable farmers who use almost any brand to increase profitability and sustainability. With retrofit, factory-fit and OEM solutions that work across mixed fleets, we help transform farmers' equipment into smarter, more efficient machines. Our PTx solutions provide retrofit solutions to upgrade farmers’ existing equipment to improve their planting, fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application and harvest operations, resulting in yield and cost optimization.These solutions are reflected in the table above. We provide telemetry-based fleet management tools, including remote monitoring and diagnostics, which help farmers improve uptime, machine and yield optimization, mixed fleet optimization and decision support, with critical data privacy choices and convenient mobile tools that offer access to data and information. These products ultimately result in improved yields or reduced waste as well as increased profitability for farmers to help enable sustainable farming. In addition, our precision agriculture solutions are based on connectivity, automation and digitalization and include satellite-based steering, field data collection, product self-adjustment and yield-mapping. PTx sells precision agriculture solutions around the crop cycle to third-party original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and supports our products, brands and the aftermarket with a comprehensive and customizable suite of solutions, enabling farmers to make individual, data-based decisions in order to reduce costs and maximize efficiency, yields and profitability. These technologies are developed internally or sourced from third parties and integrated into our products. We believe that these products and related devices are highly valued by farmers \nglobally and are integral to the current and future growth of our equipment sales and revenues. The PTx Trimble Joint Venture, which closed on April 1, 2024, complements and enhances AGCO’s existing precision agriculture portfolio to deliver even more industry leading solutions across the crop cycle by creating a global-leading mixed-fleet precision agriculture platform. By combining these two precision agriculture portfolios, we believe we are positioned to drive outsized growth and better provide next-generation technologies to even more farmers around the world.\nOperational Excellence\n    The Company is focused on operational efficiencies to build a more resilient business. On June 24, 2024, the Company announced a restructuring program (the “Program”) in response to increased weakening demand in the agriculture industry. The initial phase of the Program is focused on further reducing structural costs, streamlining the Company’s workforce and enhancing global efficiencies related to changing the Company’s operating model for certain corporate and back-office functions and better leveraging technology and global centers of excellence. The Company estimates that it will incur charges for one-time termination benefits of approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million in connection with this phase of the Program, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance payments, employees benefits and related costs. The Company incurred the majority of charges in 2024 and expects to incur the remaining charges in 2025. Once fully implemented, the Company expects this phase of the Program to yield annual run-rate benefits and cost savings of approximately $100.0 million to $125.0 million. Additionally, we are reimagining our business operations globally with efficiency initiatives and structural changes of processes (offshore, automate, outsource).\nMarket Conditions\n    Demand for agricultural equipment is cyclical, influenced by, among other things, farm income, farm land values and debt levels, financing costs, acreage planted, crop yields, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity and protein prices, agricultural product demand and general economic conditions and government policies, tariffs and subsidies. Geopolitical factors, including inflation, tariffs and regional conflicts, continue to create volatility in the global economy, including the potential for energy shortages, employment disruptions, supply chain constraints and delays in deliveries, as well as logistics interruptions. Global industry demand for farm equipment, driven by farm income, declined during 2024 in most major markets compared to 2023. The future demand for agricultural equipment will be influenced by the factors noted above.\n2024 Compared to 2023 Financial Highlights\n    Net income (loss) attributable to AGCO Corporation for 2024 was $(424.8) million, or $(5.69) per diluted share, compared to $1,171.4 million, or $15.63 per diluted share for 2023.\n    Net sales for 2024 were $11,661.9 million, or 19.1% lower than 2023, primarily due to lower sales volumes resulting from softer industry sales reflecting lower end market demand and unfavorable currency impacts. Income (loss) from operations was $(122.1) million in 2024 compared to $1,700.4 million in 2023. The decrease in income from operations in 2024 was primarily the result of lower sales and production volumes reflecting weak industry conditions, the recognition of\nthe loss on sale of the majority of the Company's G&P business as well as impairment charges and restructuring and business optimization expenses. Refer to “Financial Highlights” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for additional information.\nCompetition\n    The agricultural industry is highly competitive. We compete with several large national and international full-line suppliers, as well as numerous short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Our two principal competitors on a worldwide basis are Deere & Company and CNH Industrial N.V. We have regional competitors around the world that have significant market share in a single country or a group of countries. Additionally, the industry is attracting technology-focused companies and start-up ventures as technology increasingly impacts all aspects of the crop cycle. \n    We believe several key factors influence a buyer’s choice of farm equipment, including the strength and quality of a company’s dealers, the quality and pricing of products, dealer or brand loyalty, product availability, terms of financing and customer service. Refer to “Marketing and Distribution” for additional information.\nMarketing and Distribution\nDealers and Distributors\n    We distribute products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors. Our dealers are responsible for retail sales of equipment to end users and after-sales service and support. Our distributors may sell our product through networks of dealers supported by the distributors, and our distributors also may directly market our products and provide customer service support. Our sales are not dependent on any specific dealer, distributor or group of dealers. In some countries, we utilize associates and licensees to provide a distribution channel for our products and a source of low-cost production for certain products.\n\n                                          Independent Dealers and Distributors                                              Percent of Net Sales(1)\nGeographical Region                                                       2024                 2024                    2023                    2022\nEurope                                                                     755               55   %                  49   %                  49   %\nNorth America                                                            1,215               24   %                  26   %                  25   %\nSouth America                                                              325               11   %                  16   %                  17   %\nRest of World (2)                                                          405               10   %                   9   %                   9   %\n____________________________________\n(1)    The summation of these individual percentages may not total due to rounding.\n(2)    Consists of countries in Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.\nDealer Support and Supervision\n    We believe that one of the most important criteria affecting a farmer’s decision to purchase a particular brand of equipment is the quality of the dealer who sells and services the equipment. We support our dealers in order to improve the quality of our dealer network. In 2024, we announced the launch of FarmerCore, a global initiative to deliver a next generation farmer and dealer experience built on three pillars: the on-farm mindset, smart network coverage and digital engagement. FarmerCore will be implemented in close partnership with AGCO’s global dealer network. The program launched this year in select North and South America dealer organizations, with continued expansion expected throughout 2025. We monitor each dealer’s performance and profitability and establish programs that focus on continuous dealer improvement. Our dealers generally have sales territories for which they are responsible.\n    We believe that our ability to offer our dealers a full product line of agricultural machines and precision agriculture technology, as well as our digital tools to support the dealer’s sales, marketing, warranty and servicing efforts, helps ensure the vitality and increases the competitiveness of our dealer network. We also maintain dealer advisory groups to obtain dealer feedback on our operations.\n    We provide our dealers with volume sales incentives, demonstration programs and other advertising support to assist sales. We design our sales programs, including retail financing incentives, and our policies for maintaining parts and service availability with extensive product warranties to enhance our dealers’ competitive position.\nResources\nManufacturing and Assembly\n    We manufacture and assemble our products globally. Our locations are intended to optimize capacity, technology and local costs. We balance our manufacturing resources with externally-sourced machinery, components and/or replacement parts to enable us to better control costs, inventory levels and our supply of components. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Refer to Item 2, “Properties,” for a listing of our principal manufacturing locations.\n    Our AGCO Power division produces diesel engines, gears and generating sets. The diesel engines are manufactured for use in a majority of our tractors, combines and sprayers, and also are sold to third parties. AGCO Power specializes in the manufacturing of off-road engines in the 75 to 500 horsepower range.\nComponents and Third-Party Suppliers\n    We externally source some of our machinery, components and replacement parts from third-party suppliers. Our production strategy is intended to optimize our research and development and capital investment requirements and to allow us greater flexibility to respond to changes in market conditions.\n    We purchase some fully manufactured tractors from Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited (“TAFE”), Carraro S.p.A. and Iseki & Company, Limited. We also purchase other tractors, implements and hay and forage equipment from various third-party suppliers. On April 26, 2024, we gave notice to TAFE that the Company was terminating all of its commercial relationships with TAFE. Refer to Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for further discussion of our relationship with TAFE.\n    In addition to the purchase of machinery, third-party suppliers supply us with significant components used in our manufacturing operations. We select third-party suppliers that we believe are low cost and high quality and possess the most appropriate technology.\n    We also assist in the development of these products or component parts based upon our own design requirements. Our past experience with outside suppliers generally has been favorable, although from 2020 to 2022 we experienced supply chain disruptions for several key components, such as semiconductors. These supply chain disruptions eased over the course of 2023 and improved in 2024.\nIntellectual Property\n    We own and have licenses to the rights under a number of domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, trade names and brand names relating to our products and businesses. We defend our patent, trademark and trade and brand name rights primarily by monitoring competitors’ machines and industry publications and conducting other investigative work. We consider our intellectual property rights, including our right to use our trade and brand names, important in the operation of our businesses. However, we do not believe we are dependent on any single patent or group of patents, although several of our trade and brand names are internationally recognized and are important to our operations. We intend to maintain the separate strengths and identities of our core brand names and product lines.\nEngineering, Research and Innovation\n    We make significant expenditures for engineering and applied research to improve the quality and performance of our products, to develop new products and technologies which enhance agriculture and integrate sustainability and to comply with government safety and engine emissions regulations.\n    Through AGCO Ventures, we source and fund new technologies to drive and support farmers worldwide. This initiative actively connects our business needs with industry and market perspectives to identify investment opportunities in startup companies, corporate venture funds, incubators, accelerators, higher education and research institutions. AGCO Ventures supports the accelerated development of critical capabilities and competencies across three strategic areas: information management and analytics, agriculture technology and environmental and alternative fuel sources.\nWholesale Financing, Sales Terms and Accounts Receivable Sales Agreement\n    Primarily in the United States and Canada, we engage in the standard industry practice of providing dealers with floor plan payment terms for their inventories of farm equipment for extended periods, generally through our AGCO Finance joint ventures. The terms of our wholesale finance agreements with our dealers vary by region and product line, with fixed payment schedules on all sales, generally ranging from one to 12 months. In the United States and Canada, dealers typically are not required to make an initial down payment, and our terms allow for an interest-free period generally ranging from one to 12 months, depending on the product. Amounts due from sales to dealers in the United States and Canada are immediately due upon a retail sale of the underlying equipment by the dealer. If not previously paid by the dealer, installment payments generally are required beginning after the interest-free period with the remaining outstanding equipment balance generally due within 12 months after shipment. In limited circumstances, we provide sales terms, and in some cases interest-free periods, that are longer than 12 months for certain products. These typically are specified programs, predominantly in the United States and Canada, where interest is charged after a period of up to 24 months, depending on various factors including dealers’ sales volumes during the preceding year. We generally obtain a security interest in the new and used equipment we finance.\n    Sales terms outside the United States and Canada are typically of a shorter duration, generally ranging from 30 to 180 days. In many cases, we retain a security interest in the equipment sold on extended terms. In certain international markets, our sales are often backed by letters of credit or credit insurance.\n    We have accounts receivable sales agreements that permit transferring, on an ongoing basis, a majority of our wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to our AGCO Finance joint ventures in the United States, Canada, Europe and Brazil. Upon transfer, the wholesale receivables maintain standard payment terms, including required regular principal payments on amounts outstanding and interest charges at market rates. Qualified dealers may obtain additional financing through our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures at the joint ventures’ discretion. In addition, our AGCO Finance joint ventures may provide wholesale financing directly to dealers in Europe, Brazil and Australia. We also sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other third-party financial institutions around the world, and we account for the sale of such receivables as off-balance sheet transactions.\nRetail Financing\n    Our AGCO Finance joint ventures offer financing to most of the end users of our products. Besides contributing to our overall profitability, the AGCO Finance joint ventures enhance our sales efforts by tailoring retail finance programs to prevailing market conditions. Our AGCO Finance joint ventures provide both retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. AGCO owns a 49% interest in the joint ventures with the remaining interests owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. The majority of the assets of the finance joint ventures consist of finance receivables. The majority of the liabilities consist of notes payable and accrued interest. Under the various joint venture agreements, Rabobank provides financing to the AGCO finance joint ventures, primarily through lines of credit. We do not guarantee the debt obligations of the joint ventures. In the United States and Canada, we guarantee certain minimum residual values to those joint ventures upon expiration of certain eligible operating leases between the finance joint ventures and end users. We also have other guarantees with our other finance joint ventures. Refer to Note 22 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information.\n    In addition, Rabobank is the primary lender with respect to our credit facility, our senior term loan and our term loan facility, as are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our historical relationship with Rabobank has been strong, and we anticipate its continued long-term support of our business.\nSeasonality\n    Generally, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and largely are a function of the timing of the planting and harvesting seasons. To the extent possible, we attempt to ship products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal retail demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of the year and then decrease in the second half of the year. The fourth quarter is also typically a period for higher retail sales because of our customers’ year-end tax planning considerations, the increase in the availability of funds from completed harvests and the timing of dealer incentives. Our net sales and income from operations historically have been the lowest in the first quarter and have increased in subsequent quarters.\nEnvironmental Regulations\n    We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges of processed or other types of wastewater, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and the effects that they may have on us in the future are impossible to accurately predict. We attempt to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. However, we believe that any expense or liability we may incur in connection with noncompliance with laws or regulations or the cleanup of any of our properties will not have a materially adverse effect on us.\n    The engines manufactured by our AGCO Power division, which specializes in manufacturing off-road engines in the 75 to 500 horsepower range, currently comply with emissions standards and related requirements set by European, Brazilian and U.S. regulatory authorities, including both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and various state authorities. We expect to meet future emissions requirements through the introduction of new technology to our engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. In some markets, such as the United States, we must obtain governmental environmental approvals in order to import our products, and these approvals can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain or may not be \nobtainable at all. Production at our facilities and sales of our products could be impaired if AGCO Power and our other engine suppliers are unable to timely respond to any changes in environmental laws and regulations affecting engine emissions, including the emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). Compliance with environmental and safety regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of our products and increase the capital-intensive nature of our business.\nRegulation and Government Policy\n    We have manufacturing facilities or other physical presence globally and sell our products primarily through independent dealers and distributors in approximately 140 countries. This subjects us to a range of trade, product, foreign exchange, employment, tax, tariffs, environmental and other laws and regulations, in addition to the environmental regulations discussed previously, in a significant number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions and a variety of laws regulate the contractual relationships with our dealers. These laws impose substantive standards on the relationships between us and our dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts and equipment repurchase requirements. Such laws could adversely affect our ability to terminate our dealers.\n    In addition, each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products has an important interest in the success of its agricultural industry and the consistency of the availability of reasonably priced food sources. These interests result in active political involvement in the agricultural industry, which in turn, can impact our business in a variety of ways.\nSustainability\n    Our farmers continue to face increased challenges due to climate change. Our goal is to ensure that farmers have the machines and technologies they need to sustainably feed the world. Our products enable smart farming to help farms and machines run more efficiently with lower inputs and higher yields. Our precision agriculture products enable farmers to precisely place optimal amounts of inputs such as fertilizer, weed control and seeds. In addition, we are committed to driving down machinery emissions through battery powered electric tractors and other alternative fuel propulsion solutions to help farmers decarbonize and optimize their operations. AGCO also supports retrofit products on an array of OEM brands to customers which provide more flexibility, extend product lifecycles, and generate less emissions compared to new products.\n    While much of our focus is on innovating sustainable solutions, we are also committed to integrating sustainability into our core business strategy. Our low-carbon transition plan establishes key levers to reduce our climate impact by addressing both operational and value chain emissions. In our operations, we are embracing renewable energy and furthering initiatives to make our sites more energy efficient. Throughout our value chain, we attempt to deliver sustainable product solutions, optimize our transportation and logistics networks and engage supply chain partners to help drive environmental progress.\nHuman Capital\n    Our employees are our greatest asset and a key enabler of our success. We have approximately 24,000 employees worldwide, all guided by our Company’s clear purpose – to create farmer-focused solutions to sustainably feed our world. We are dedicated to retaining and developing our employees by promoting safety and well-being, providing opportunities for them to learn and lead, and creating a culture where they feel welcomed, valued, and heard.\n    Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short and long-term performance that aligns with and drives shareholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency and performance to attract and retain key talent. In addition to salaries, our compensation programs include annual short-term and long-term incentives and participation in various retirement savings plans, dependent upon the position and level of employee and the countries in which we operate. In 2024, our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 6.9%, compared to 7.5% in 2023.\n    Our employees engage in learning and development targeted to their current roles and future career aspirations. This includes completing online, self-directed and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories – leadership, professional skills, technical competencies and compliance. Compliance training includes educating our employees about AGCO’s cultural beliefs and ensuring they comply with our global Code of Conduct and associated policies, including anti-bribery/corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment and sexual harassment.\n    We are deeply committed to identifying and developing the next generation of top-tier leadership by placing focus on technologically innovative talent. We conduct quarterly in-depth talent and succession reviews with our senior leadership team that concentrate on accelerating talent development and strengthening succession pipelines for our most critical roles, including recruiting from within. We review our succession plans with our Board’s Talent and Compensation Committee annually.\n    During 2024, we shared our fourth annual global employee experience and engagement survey to all employees across our offices and shop floor locations worldwide to seek feedback on what we are doing well and where we can improve. The results showed a favorable engagement score of approximately 67%, which aligns with our core employee engagement index metric, based upon 81% workforce participation. In addition to our annual survey, we conducted intermittent pulse surveys, which enabled real-time feedback on targeted topics.\n    We are committed to ensuring our Board is highly-skilled and gender-diverse. Three of our current ten board members are women. Women represent approximately 14% of our full-time executive positions at the senior vice president and vice president levels, and approximately 18% of our overall full-time management-level employees. We want to increase the percentage of female representation in our full time management-level employee group and our overall global employee base.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\n    We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, striving to work safe, every day in every way. Our health and safety program focuses on risk reduction and safety management systems that promote preventative measures. We have implemented many leading and lagging indicators for enabling employee health and safety. Leading indicators are measured using proactive prevention programs that are designed to reduce overall risks by implementing risk assessments, ergonomic assessments and incident investigations to include detailed root cause corrective action analysis, near-miss corrective actions, and behavioral-based safety programs. The lagging indicators are measured by each of our facilities and demonstrate the current state regarding injury rates such as total case incident rate (“TCIR”). This is the fourth year in a row we achieved double digit improvement in our global TCIR rate. We reported a global TCIR of 0.89 in 2024 compared to 1.86 in 2023, which is an approximate 52% decrease and exceeded our target to achieve a target TCIR equal to 1.0 by 2025.\nUnions, Collective Bargaining Agreements and Work Councils\n    Of our worldwide employees, approximately 4,000 are located in the United States. Many of our global manufacturing employees, and some other employees, are represented by unions and works councils, and a significant number of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that typically are for terms of three to five years and are renegotiated in connection with renewals. We currently do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing these agreements.\nHuman Rights Policy\n    We are committed to respecting human rights in all aspects of our global operations under our global Human Rights Policy. We believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that human rights are understood and observed in every region in which we operate. We strive to foster safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces wherever we do business, including prohibiting human trafficking, slavery, child labor or any other form of forced or involuntary labor. Our commitment to human rights also includes improving agricultural prosperity and supporting marginalized farmers and vulnerable populations in developing countries where our activities contribute to addressing adverse human rights impacts. Through our AGCO Agriculture Foundation, as well as our brand and regional engagement activities, we support a variety of non-profit organizations and local community-based groups. In 2024, we introduced the Employee Relief Fund to provide critical support for our employees in the wake of significant crisis events such as natural disasters.\nAvailable Information\n    Our Internet address is www.agcocorp.com.

      "text": "Item 1A.    Risk Factors\n    We make forward-looking statements in this report, in other materials we file with the SEC, on our website, in press releases and in materials that we otherwise share with the public. In addition, our senior management makes forward-looking statements to investors, analysts, the media and others. Statements, including the statements contained in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” concerning our future operations, prospects, strategies, products, manufacturing facilities, legal proceedings, financial condition, financial performance (including net sales, earnings and related growth) and demand for our products and services, as well as other statements of our beliefs or expectations of industry conditions, foreign currency translation impacts, market demand, supply chain and logistics disruptions, farm incomes, weather conditions, commodity and protein prices, general economic conditions, dividends, share repurchases, availability of financing, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, margins, production and sales volumes, factory productivity, pricing impacts, material costs, benefits from cost reduction initiatives, investments in, and results of, product development and enhancement, compliance with financial covenants, support from lenders, recovery of amounts under guarantee, uncertain income tax provisions, tax rates, funding of our pension and postretirement benefit plans, or realization of net deferred tax assets, are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions, risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the SEC. There also are other factors that we may not describe, generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material, or likely to become material, that also could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\n    These risks could impact our business in a number of ways, including by negatively impacting our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For simplicity, below we collectively refer to these potential impacts as impacts on our “performance.”\n    We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nMarket, Economic and Geopolitical Risks\nOur financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry, and factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally, including declines in the general economy, increases in farm input costs, unfavorable weather conditions and lower commodity and protein prices, adversely affect our performance.\n    Our success depends entirely on the vitality of the agricultural industry. Historically, the agricultural industry has been cyclical and subject to a variety of economic and other factors. Sales of agricultural equipment, in turn, also are cyclical and generally reflect the economic health of the agricultural industry. The economic health of the agricultural industry is affected by numerous factors, including farm income, farm land values and debt levels and financing costs, all of which are influenced by levels of commodity and protein prices, acreage planted, crop yields, agricultural product demand, farm input costs, government policies, tariffs and government subsidies. The economic health of the agricultural industry also is influenced by general economic conditions, interest rate and exchange rate levels, and the availability of financing for retail customers, including government financing subsidies to farmers, which can be significant in countries such as Brazil, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. Trends in the agricultural industry, such as farm consolidations, may affect the agricultural equipment market. In addition, weather conditions, such as floods, heat waves or droughts, and pervasive livestock or crop diseases affect farmers’ buying decisions. Downturns in the agricultural industry due to these or other factors, which could vary by market, can result in decreases in demand for agricultural equipment, which would adversely affect our performance. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of many of these factors and the resulting volatility in demand make it difficult for us to accurately predict sales and optimize production. This, in turn, can result in higher costs, including inventory carrying costs and underutilized manufacturing capacity. During previous downturns in the agricultural industry, we experienced significant and prolonged declines in our performance, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar market fluctuations in the future.\nThe agricultural equipment industry is highly seasonal, and seasonal fluctuations significantly impact our performance.\n    The agricultural equipment business is highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results and our cash flow to fluctuate during the year. Farmers generally purchase agricultural equipment in the spring and fall in conjunction with the major planting and harvesting seasons. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for retail sales because of year-end tax planning considerations, the increase in availability of funds from completed harvests, and the timing of dealer \nincentives. Our net sales and income from operations historically have been the lowest in the first quarter and have increased in subsequent quarters.\nMost of our sales depend on the availability of financing to retail customers, and any disruption in their ability to obtain financing, whether due to economic downturns or otherwise, will result in the sale of fewer products by us. In addition, the collectability of receivables that are created from our sales, as well as from such retail financing, is critical to our business.\n    Most retail sales of our products are financed, either by our AGCO Finance joint ventures or by a bank or other private lender. The AGCO Finance joint ventures, which are controlled by Rabobank and are dependent upon Rabobank for financing as well, finance approximately 50% of the retail sales of our tractors and combines in the markets where the joint ventures operate. Any difficulty by Rabobank in continuing to provide that financing, or any business decision by Rabobank as the controlling member not to fund the business or particular aspects of it (for example, a particular country or region), would require the joint ventures to find other sources of financing (which may be difficult to obtain) or would require us to find other sources of financing for our dealers and their retail customers.\n    If we are unable to obtain other sources of financing, our dealers and their retail customers would be required to utilize other retail financing providers, which may or may not be available. In an economic downturn, we expect that financing for capital equipment purchases generally would become more difficult and more expensive to obtain. To the extent that financing is not available, or available only at unattractive prices, it would negatively impact our performance.\n    Both AGCO and our AGCO Finance joint ventures have substantial accounts receivable from dealers and retail customers and are adversely impacted when collectability is less than optimal. Overall collectability depends upon the financial strength of the agricultural industry, which in turn depends upon the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. Certain finance joint ventures lease equipment that may experience residual value losses that exceed expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected returns at lease maturity. AGCO guarantees minimum residual values for some of the leased equipment. To the extent that defaults and losses are higher than expected, our equity in the net earnings of the finance joint ventures would be less, or there could be losses, which could materially impact our performance.\nA majority of our sales and manufacturing take place outside the United States, and, as a result, we are exposed to risks related to foreign laws, tariffs, taxes, economic conditions, labor supply and relations, political conditions and governmental policies as well as U.S. laws governing who we sell to and how we conduct business. These risks may delay or reduce our realization of value from our international operations.\n    A majority of our sales are derived from sales outside the United States. The foreign countries in which our sales are the greatest are Germany, France, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Finland and Canada. We have significant manufacturing operations in France, Germany, Brazil, Italy and Finland, and we have established manufacturing operations in emerging markets, such as China. Many of our sales involve products that are manufactured in one country and sold in a different country, and therefore, our performance can be adversely affected by adverse changes, in either the country of origin or the country of destination, by the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, particularly the factors that impact the delivered cost of our products. Our business practices in these foreign countries must comply with not just local law, but also U.S. law, including limitations on where and to whom we may sell products and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of violations of these laws, but it is difficult to identify and prevent violations. Significant violations could subject us to fines and other penalties as well as increased compliance costs. Some of our international operations also are, or might become, subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations, including restrictions on dividends and the repatriation of funds. Foreign emerging markets may present special risks, such as unavailability of financing, inflation, slow economic growth, price controls and difficulties in complying with U.S. regulations.\n    Domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the international agricultural industry, which affects the demand for agricultural equipment. Declines in demand for agricultural equipment adversely affect our performance. Future pandemics, in addition to related or unrelated application, modification or adoption of laws, regulations, trade agreements or policies, can adversely affect the agricultural industry, including the imposition of import and export duties and quotas, expropriation and potentially burdensome taxation, and could have an adverse effect on our performance. Trade restrictions, including potential withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in the international markets in which we operate and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. These changes, particularly increases in the cost of steel, also can impact the cost of the products we manufacture. Trade restrictions and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding, global trade policy also could affect our competitive position. \n    The U.S. government has recently announced tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum. The U.S. government has also recently indicated that it intends to impose tariffs on goods imported from foreign countries, including China, Mexico and Canada. In addition, the U.S. government has also indicated that additional tariffs may be imposed on imports from other countries in the future. There is substantial uncertainty surrounding these tariffs, including any retaliatory tariffs and other consequences that may arise from the imposition of tariffs on imports from, and exports to, these other countries. These risks may delay, adversely impact or reduce our realization of value from our international operations. For more information on the risks surrounding tariffs and trade regulation, see the risk factor titled “Changes to United States tax, tariff, trade and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business”.\n    As previously discussed, the health of the agricultural industry and the ability of our international dealers and retail customers to operate their businesses, in general, are affected by domestic and foreign government programs that provide economic support to farmers. As a result, farm income levels and the ability of farmers to obtain advantageous financing and other protections would be reduced to the extent that any such programs are curtailed or eliminated. A recent freeze on the provision of funding and spending in foreign countries through U.S. foreign aid programs has created economic uncertainty for farmers, and more permanent suspensions or reductions in the provision of foreign aid by the U.S. could occur in the future and create greater global uncertainty. Any such reductions likely would result in a decrease in demand for agricultural equipment. For example, a decrease or elimination of current price protections for commodities or of subsidy payments or financing rate subsidies for farmers in the European Union, the United States, Brazil or elsewhere would negatively impact the operations of farmers in those regions, and, as a result, our sales may decline if these farmers delay, reduce or cancel purchases of our products. In emerging markets, some of these (and other) risks can be greater than they might be elsewhere. In addition, the financing provided by the AGCO Finance joint ventures or by others in certain jurisdictions is supported by a government subsidy or guarantee in some markets, including financing rate subsidies. The programs under which those subsidies and guarantees are provided generally are of limited duration and subject to renewal and contain various caps and other limitations. In some markets, for example Brazil, this support is quite significant and, from time to time, has not been available. In the event the governments that provide this support elect not to renew these programs, and were financing not available on reasonable terms, whether through our AGCO Finance joint ventures or otherwise, our performance would be negatively impacted.\n    In 2024 and 2023, we had net sales of approximately $90 million and $85 million, respectively, in Ukraine. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had less than $15 million in assets in Ukraine. It is unclear what impact the hostilities in Ukraine going forward will have on our net sales or assets, although we assume that our net sales may continue to decline in Ukraine, possibly significantly. We assess the fair value of our assets in Ukraine for potential impairment on a periodic basis as warranted.\n    In addition, AGCO sells products in, and purchases parts and components from, other regions where there could be hostilities. Should hostilities arise, we would expect our sales to decline and for our parts and component deliveries to be interrupted, which would adversely impact our performance.\n    As a result of the multinational nature of our business and the acquisitions that we have made over time, our corporate and tax structures are complex, with a significant portion of our operations being held through foreign holding companies. As a result, we are subject to taxation from multiple tax jurisdictions, and it can be inefficient, from a tax perspective, for us to repatriate or otherwise transfer funds. In addition, we must comply with a greater level of tax-related regulation and reviews by multiple governmental units than do companies with a more simplified structure. Our foreign and U.S. operations also routinely sell products to, and license technology to, other operations of ours. The pricing of these intra-company transactions is subject to regulation and review as well. While we make every effort to comply with all applicable tax laws, audits and other reviews by governmental entities for non-compliance could result in our companies being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our international operations.\nWe face significant competition, and, if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we will lose dealers and their retail customers and our performance will decline.\n    The agricultural equipment business is highly competitive, particularly in our major markets. Our two key competitors, Deere & Company and CNH Industrial N.V., are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources. In addition, in some markets, we compete with smaller regional competitors with significant market share in a single country or group of countries. Our competitors may substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing, including discounting, of products that compete with our products, which would necessitate our making similar expenditures. Additionally, the industry is attracting technology-focused companies and start-up ventures as technology increasingly impacts all aspects of the crop cycle. Competitive pressures in the agricultural equipment business may affect the market prices of new and used equipment, which, in turn, may adversely affect our performance.\n    We maintain an independent dealer and distribution network in the markets where we sell products. The financial and operational capabilities of our dealers and distributors are critical to our ability to compete in these markets. In addition, we compete with other manufacturers of agricultural equipment for dealers. If we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we could lose dealers and their retail customers and performance may decline.\nOur expansion plans in emerging markets entail significant risks.\n    Our long-term strategy includes establishing a greater manufacturing and supply-chain and/or marketing presence in emerging markets such as India and Africa. As we progress with these efforts, it will involve a significant investment of capital and other resources and entail various risks. These include risks attendant to obtaining necessary governmental approvals and the construction of facilities in a timely manner and within cost estimates, the establishment of supply channels, the commencement of efficient manufacturing operations, and, ultimately, the acceptance of the products by retail customers. While we expect the expansion to be successful, should we encounter difficulties involving these or similar factors, it may not be as successful as we anticipate and could adversely impact our performance.\nInflation can impact our costs and sales.\n    During 2022 and 2023, we experienced significant inflation in a range of costs, including for parts and components, labor, transportation, logistics, and energy. While inflation eased over 2023 and continued to ease in 2024, and we were able to pass along these higher costs through increased prices, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. If we are not, it will adversely impact our performance.\nProduct Development, Manufacturing and Operations\nOur success depends on the introduction of new products, which requires substantial expenditures.\n    Our long-term results depend upon our ability to introduce and market new products successfully. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n•innovation;\n•customer acceptance;\n•the efficiency of our suppliers in providing component parts and of our manufacturing facilities in producing final products; and\n•the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors.\n    As both we and our competitors continuously introduce new products or refine versions of existing products, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. We have experienced delays in the introduction of new products in the past, and we may experience delays in the future. Any delays or other problems with our new product launches, such as high warranty costs, will adversely affect our performance. In addition, introducing new products can result in decreases in revenues from our existing products. \n    Consistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements, we expect to make substantial investments in product development and refinement. We may need more funding for product development and refinement than is readily available, which could adversely affect our performance.\nIf we are unable to deliver precision agriculture and high-tech solutions to our customers, it could materially adversely affect our performance.\n    Increasingly our customers are implementing precision farming solutions. In order to remain competitive, we have been able to successfully acquire or develop and introduce new solutions that improve profitability and sustainable farming techniques. Our precision technology products include both hardware and software components that relate to guidance, telemetry, automation, autonomy and connectivity solutions. We expect to make significant investments in research and development expenses, acquisitions of businesses, collaborative arrangements and other sources of technology to drive these outcomes. These investments include the acquisition of the agriculture assets and technologies of Trimble through the formation of a joint venture of which we own 85% as further discussed in the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction risk factor below. Such investments may not produce attractive solutions for our customers. We also may have to depend on third parties \nto supply certain hardware or software components or data services in our precision technology products. Our dealers' ability to support such solutions also may impact our customers, acceptance and demand of such products.\nRationalization or restructuring of manufacturing facilities, and plant expansions and system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities, may cause production capacity constraints and inventory fluctuations.\n    The rationalization of our manufacturing facilities has at times resulted in, and similar rationalizations or restructurings (including relocating production from one facility to another) in the future may result in, temporary constraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner. In addition, system upgrades at our manufacturing facilities that impact ordering, production scheduling, manufacturing and other related processes are complex, and could impact or delay production. A prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our product inventories, causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our performance. Moreover, our continuous development and production of new products often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing facilities. This retooling may limit our production capacity at certain times in the future, which could adversely affect our performance. In addition, the expansion and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing facilities, as well as new or expanded manufacturing operations in emerging markets, could increase the risk of production delays, as well as require significant investments.\nWe depend on suppliers for components, parts and raw materials for our products, and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed, or by us to promptly address supplier issues, will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products. We also are subject to raw material price fluctuations, which can adversely affect our manufacturing costs.\n    Our products include components and parts manufactured by others. As a result, our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture current products, to introduce new products, and to shift manufacturing of products from one facility to another depends on the quality of these components and parts and the timeliness of their delivery to our facilities. During 2022, we experienced significant supply chain interruptions, including delays in timely deliveries of components. While supply chain disruptions eased in 2023 and 2024, there can be no assurance that there will not be future disruptions. In addition, the potential of future natural gas shortages in Europe, as well as predicted overall shortages in other energy sources, could also negatively impact our production and that of our supply chain in the future. At any particular time, we depend on numerous suppliers, and the failure by one or more of our suppliers to perform as needed will result in fewer products being manufactured, shipped and sold. If the quality of the components or parts provided by our suppliers is less than required and we do not recognize that failure prior to the shipment of our products, we will incur higher warranty costs. The timely supply of component parts for our products also depends on our ability to manage our relationships with suppliers, to identify and replace suppliers that fail to meet our schedules or quality standards, and to monitor the flow of components and accurately project our needs. The shift from our existing suppliers to new suppliers, including suppliers in emerging markets, also may impact the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing capabilities, as well as warranty costs.\n    Changes in the availability and prices of certain raw materials, components and parts could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on the sale of our products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and parts, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, as well as regulatory instability or change in tariffs, can significantly increase the costs of production. This, in turn, could have a material negative effect on performance, particularly if, due to pricing considerations or other factors, we are unable to recover the increased costs through pricing from our dealers.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire and may not fully achieve, or achieve within a reasonable time frame, expected strategic objectives and other expected benefits of the acquisitions.\n    From time-to-time we seek to expand through acquisitions of other businesses. We expect to realize strategic and other benefits as a result of our acquisitions, including, among other things, the opportunity to extend our reach in the agricultural industry and provide our dealers and their retail customers with an even wider range of products and services. However, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether, or to what extent, these benefits will be realized or whether we will be able to integrate acquired businesses in a timely and effective manner. For example:\n•the costs of integrating acquired businesses and their operations may be higher than we expect and may require significant attention from our management;\n•the businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities, such as environmental liabilities or liabilities for violations of laws, such as the FCPA, that we did not expect;\n•our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategies for acquired businesses often will be affected by, among other things, our ability to maintain and enhance our relationships with their existing customers, our ability to provide additional product distribution opportunities to the acquired businesses through our existing distribution channels, changes in the spending patterns and preferences of customers and potential customers, fluctuating economic and competitive conditions and our ability to retain their key personnel; and\n•our approach and strategies with respect to the development and introduction of new precision technology solutions to improve the profitability and sustainability for our farmer customers, including technologies we obtain through acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, may not provide the desired results for our customers.\n    Our ability to address these issues will determine the extent to which we are able to successfully integrate, develop and grow acquired businesses and technologies to realize the expected benefits of these transactions. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the PTx Trimble joint venture into our business, which could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\n    We closed the acquisition of the agriculture assets and technologies of Trimble through the formation of the PTx Trimble joint venture, of which we own 85%, on April 1, 2024. Joint venture transactions involve many risks, including the challenges attendant to integrating the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired lines of businesses, reactions by customers to the transaction, particularly the rate at which Trimble’s largest OEM customer reduces purchases of Trimble equipment and the levels of the OEM's product supply remaining in the market, and the rate of replacement by the joint venture of those sales, personnel turnover, and the diversion of management's attention from other business matters. We may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from the transaction in the time frame that we anticipate, or at all. All of these risks, as well as the others that typically accompany a large transaction, could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nOur business routinely is subject to claims and legal actions, some of which could be material.\n    We routinely are a party to claims and legal actions incidental to our business. These include claims for personal injuries by users of farm equipment, disputes with distributors, vendors and others with respect to commercial matters, and disputes with taxing and other governmental authorities regarding the conduct of our business, including environmental matters. While these matters generally are not material to our business, it is entirely possible that a matter will arise that is material.\n    In addition, we use a broad range of technology in our products. We developed some of this technology, we license some of this technology from others, and some of the technology is embedded in the components and parts that we purchase from suppliers. From time-to-time, third parties make claims that the technology that we use violates their patent rights. While to date none of these claims have been significant, we cannot provide any assurances that there will not be significant claims in the future or that currently existing claims will not prove to be more significant than anticipated.\nWe are, and in the past have been, subject to the actions of activist stockholders, which could divert management’s attention and negatively impact our business.\n    The Company values constructive input from investors and regularly engages in dialogue with its shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Company’s Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all the Company’s shareholders. Stockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our Board of Directors and management. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Company’s operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors, management and the Company’s employees. Such activities could interfere with the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plan. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may affect the market price and volatility of the Company’s common stock, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from a proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nFinancial Risks\nWe can experience substantial and sustained volatility with respect to currency exchange rates and interest rates, which can adversely affect our performance and the competitiveness of our products.\n    We conduct operations in a variety of currencies. Our production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. We also are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we denominate sales, and to risks associated with translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into United States dollars. Similarly, changes in interest rates affect us by increasing or decreasing borrowing costs and finance income. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar, and the Euro in relation to the British pound. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, we attempt to manage these risks by economically hedging some, but not necessarily all, of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward exchange or option contracts. As with all hedging instruments, there are risks associated with the use of foreign currency forward exchange or option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and other risk management contracts. While the use of such hedging instruments provides us with protection for a finite period of time from certain fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, when we hedge we forego part or all of the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates. In addition, any default by the counterparties to these transactions could adversely affect our performance. Despite our use of economic hedging transactions, currency exchange rate or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our performance.\n    We also are subject to the risk of the imposition of limitations by governments on international transfers of funds. In recent years, the Argentine government has substantially limited the ability of companies to transfer funds out of Argentina. As a consequence of these limitations, the spread between the official government exchange rate and the exchange rates resulting implicitly from certain capital market operations, usually effected to obtain United States dollars, has broadened significantly. In December 2023, the central bank of Argentina adjusted the official foreign currency exchange rate for the Argentine peso, significantly devaluing the currency relative to the United States dollar. In December 2023, we recorded losses of approximately $80.4 million related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and the related impacts to our AGCO finance joint venture in Argentina as included within Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Further devaluation of the peso or continuation or expansion of limitations of transfer of funds in Argentina or in other markets in which we operate, would adversely affect our performance. Please refer to the \"Foreign Currency Risk Management\" section within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information.\nWe have significant pension and retiree healthcare obligations with respect to our employees, and our cash flow available for other purposes may be adversely affected in the event that payments become due under any pension plans that are unfunded or underfunded. Declines in the market value of the securities used to fund these obligations will result in increased pension expense in future periods.\n    A portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit pension and retiree healthcare plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets, if any, of the applicable plans. To the extent that our obligations are unfunded or underfunded, we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to fulfill our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period. In addition, since the assets that we already have provided to fund these obligations are invested in debt instruments and other securities, the value of these assets varies due to market factors. Historically, these fluctuations have been significant and sometimes adverse, and there can be no assurances that they will not be significant or adverse in the future. Similarly the amount of our obligations varies depending upon mortality assumptions, discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates and ages, inflation, changes in health care costs and similar factors, which generally are not in our control. We also are subject to laws and regulations governing the administration of our plans in certain countries, and the specific provisions, benefit formulas and related interpretations of such laws, regulations and provisions can be complex. Failure to properly administer the provisions of our plans and comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse impact to our results of operations. We have unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension and other postretirement health care benefits. See the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for more information regarding our unfunded or underfunded obligations.\nWe have substantial goodwill, and impairment of that goodwill could materially impact our results of operation.\n    As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1,820.4 million of goodwill reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" we test goodwill for impairment annually or more often under certain circumstances. Goodwill can be difficult to value, and in all events valuation requires the use of estimates and judgment as discussed in \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Our goodwill was created in connection with business acquisitions. If those businesses do not perform as expected, future valuations may not support the amount of goodwill, and we could conclude that an impairment has occurred. Similarly, if the estimates and judgment used in our annual impairment tests prove to be incorrect, impairment could be required. An impairment of goodwill could be significant and could materially impact our results of operations. In connection with the PTx Trimble joint venture transaction, we recognized $1,592.2 million of goodwill as of the acquisition date. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $351 million, which resulted from the deterioration of the near-term outlook of the PTx Trimble North America reporting unit driven by weak industry demand and lower market penetration. While our annual impairment testing in 2024 now supports the carrying amount of this goodwill, we may be required to re-evaluate the carrying amount in future periods, thus utilizing different assumptions that reflect the then current market conditions and expectations, and, therefore, we could conclude that an impairment has occurred. Additionally, as the carrying value of the PTx Trimble North America reporting unit approximates its fair value following the impairment charge, the PTx Trimble North America reporting unit is considered at risk of future impairment. If our assumptions are not realized, or if there are future changes in any of the assumptions due to a change in economic conditions or otherwise, it is possible that a further impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and, as a result, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.\n    Our credit facility and certain other debt agreements have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain certain total debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. In addition, the credit facility and certain other debt agreements contain other restrictive covenants, such as ones that limit the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments, including dividends, and are subject to acceleration in the event of default. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result.\n    If any event of default were to occur, our lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under our credit facility or certain other debt agreements also could result in an event of default under our other financing agreements.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have other important adverse consequences such as:\n•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the agricultural industry;\n•restricting us from being able to introduce new products or pursuing business opportunities;\n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less indebtedness; and\n•limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, repurchase shares, pay cash dividends or engage in or enter into certain transactions.\nChanges to United States tax, tariff, trade and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\n    There have been ongoing discussions and significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes. Although the levels change from period to period, we generally have substantial imports into the United States of products and components that are either produced in our foreign locations or are purchased from foreign suppliers, and also have substantial exports of products and components that we manufacture in the United States. The impact of any changes to current trade, tariff or tax policies relating to imports and exports of goods is dependent on factors such as the treatment of exports as a credit to \nimports, and the introduction of any tariffs or taxes relating to imports from specific countries. Tariff changes are difficult to predict and may cause us material short-term or long-term cost fluctuations. The new political administration in the United States has signaled an intention to use tariffs more robustly in pursuing government policy and has already implemented some new tariffs. When increases are made to U.S. duty rates or tariffs, reciprocal action by other countries sometimes occurs, and any such increases could impact the price of our products and cause a decline in the demand for our products. We rely on the use of free trade agreements, where available, that may experience alterations, suspensions or cancellations, which could increase our customs expense or otherwise harm our business. In addition to duties and tariffs, any actions taken by the United States or by foreign countries to further implement trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory requirements, or other actions that impact our ability to obtain necessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business. These actions are unpredictable, and any of them could also have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, significantly reduce global trade, restrict our access to suppliers or customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n    Further, the Pacific Rim region is an important producer of parts and components that are critical to our products, particularly semiconductor chips. Should events in that region or between governments in that region and the countries in which we manufacture products deteriorate, it could significantly and adversely impact the availability of parts and components to us, and, correspondingly, our ability to produce products at targeted levels. \n    Changes to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n    On December 15, 2022, the European Union Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The European Union effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. Based on the issued guidance and interpretation, the Company does not expect a material top-up tax. As this is an evolving area with new guidance and practices being developed, the Company continues to assess the impact of the Pillar Two income taxes legislation on its future financial performance.\nFuture pandemics and public health crises could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n    Any future pandemic or other new public health crises may disrupt our business in the future, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future expectations. Any such events may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to suspend our operations in the affected markets. In particular, we could experience, among other things: continued or additional global supply chain and logistics disruptions; labor disruptions or shortages; an inability to manufacture; and an inability to sell to our customers.\nClimate Change and Other Environmental Risks\nWe increasingly are subject to risks attendant to climate change. Failure to understand and prepare for the risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change could impact our performance.\n    It is widely recognized that global climate change is occurring. We are unable to predict with any certainty the impacts upon our business of climate change, although we recognize that they are likely to be significant. Among the risks that we face are (i) increased governmental regulation of both our manufacturing operations and the equipment that we produce, (ii) the possibility that we will not become as resource-efficient in our operations as we need to, both as a result of our own actions (or inaction) and those of our suppliers, (iii) that we will not be able to develop new and improved products that help our farmer customers address climate-related changes and opportunities and that keep our products competitive with the products of others, (iv) that climate change will reduce demand for our products, and (v) the impacts on our physical facilities, including from increased severe weather condition risks. The first three of these risks may be considered “transition” risks. Addressing each of these risks is likely to entail the incurrence of significant costs by us, although, in the case of transition risks, we already may be incurring many, if not most, of these costs through our ongoing engine development programs, carbon footprint reduction projects, and our precision farming research and development. However, we may not be able to address these risks effectively and efficiently, which would impact our performance.\n    In addition, regulators in Europe and the U.S. have focused efforts on increasing reporting and disclosure requirements over climate risks, climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, and GHG. Our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations or other criticisms of our sustainability disclosures could lead to penalties or claims and other litigation, impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention, and otherwise adversely impact our performance. Compliance with these requirements will be complex and expensive.\n    Investors and financial institutions increasingly are expecting the disclosures described above, and some financial institutional investors are assessing their investments and investment opportunities based upon how businesses are addressing climate change. Any failure by us to satisfy their assessments could impact the desirability of an investment in AGCO, our access to capital could be restricted and the share price of our common stock could be impacted. For a discussion of some of the actions that we have taken, see Item 1, “Business”, above.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including increasingly stringent engine emissions standards, and our compliance with, or our failure to comply with, existing or future laws and regulations could delay production of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n    In addition to the more general climate change regulation described above, we are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These regulations govern, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Our costs of complying with these or any other current or future environmental regulations may be significant. For example, several countries have adopted more stringent environmental regulations regarding emissions into the air, and it is possible that new emissions-related legislation or regulations will be adopted in connection with concerns regarding GHG. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to us in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase our operating costs through higher utility and transportation expenses and costs of materials. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs also could impact retail customer operations and demand for our equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, we are unable to predict its potential impact at this time.\n    In addition, the products that we manufacture or sell, particularly engines, are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, including those that limit GHG emissions. As a result, on an ongoing basis we incur significant engineering expenses and capital expenditures to modify our products to comply with these regulations. Further, we may experience production delays if we or our suppliers are unable to design and manufacture components for our products that comply with environmental standards. For instance, as we are required to meet more stringent engine emission reduction standards that are applicable to engines we manufacture or incorporate into our products, we expect to meet these requirements through the introduction of new technology to our products, engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. Failure to meet applicable requirements could materially affect our performance.\n    We also may be subject to liability in connection with properties and businesses that we no longer own or operate. We may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted in the future that could apply to both future and prior conduct. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, or we may not be able to sell our products and, therefore, it could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to disclosure obligations with respect to conflict materials. \n    We are subject to SEC disclosure obligations relating to “conflict minerals” (columbite-tantalite, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (tungsten) and gold) that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjacent countries. Complying with these requirements has and will require us to incur additional costs, including the costs to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products and to modify our processes or products, if required. As a result, we may choose to modify the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials in our products. In addition, we may face reputational and regulatory risks if the information that we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate, or our process for obtaining that information does not fulfill the SEC’s requirements. We have a formal policy with respect to the use of conflict minerals in our products that is intended to minimize, if not eliminate, conflict minerals sourced from the covered countries to the extent that we are unable to document that they have been obtained from conflict-free sources.\nHuman Capital Risks\nOur labor force is heavily unionized, and our obligations under collective bargaining agreements and labor laws subject us to the risks of work interruption or stoppage and could cause our costs to be higher.\n    Most of our employees, most notably at our manufacturing facilities, are subject to collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates. Several of our collective bargaining agreements and union contracts generally are of limited duration and, therefore, must be re-negotiated frequently. As a result, we are at greater risk of work interruptions or stoppages than non-unionized companies, and any work interruption or stoppage could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to streamline existing manufacturing facilities, restructure our business or otherwise reduce our labor costs because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions.\nOur ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified and skilled employees could impact our ability to execute strategies.\n    Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified employees with the relevant education, background and experience. Equally we must be able to retain such skilled employees through our efforts to develop, train, compensate and engage them. Failure to do so could impair our ability to execute our business strategies and could ultimately impact our performance.\nData Security, Privacy and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur business increasingly is subject to regulations relating to privacy and data protection, and if we violate any of those regulations we could be subject to significant claims, penalties and damages.\n    Increasingly, the United States, the European Union, Brazil and other governmental entities are imposing regulations designed to protect the collection, maintenance and transfer of personal information. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) that imposed stringent data protection requirements and greater penalties for non-compliance beginning in May 2018. The GDPR also protects a broader set of personal information than traditionally has been protected in the United States and provides for a right of “erasure.” Other regulations govern the collection and transfer of financial data and data security generally. These regulations generally impose penalties in the event of violations, and private lawsuits in the event of a release of personal information are common. While we attempt to comply with all applicable privacy regulations, their implementation is complex, and, if we are not successful, we may be subject to penalties and claims for damages from regulators and the impacted parties.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise confidential information, exposing us to liability that could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n    We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of our equipment. We also use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. On May 5, 2022, we discovered that we had been subject to a ransomware cyberattack. The attack resulted in the temporary closure of most of our production sites and parts operations. A majority of the affected locations resumed operations within approximately two weeks after the attack was discovered. There was some data exfiltration as a result of the attack, and a portion of the exfiltrated data subsequently was released publicly. We do not have significant retail operations, and we do not believe that the exfiltrated data included privacy- protected consumer data or that the exfiltration was consequential. We have invested heavily in maturing our information technology and cybersecurity operations and continue to review and improve our safeguards to minimize our exposure to future attacks. The cost of remediation to the impacted systems has not been material. We maintain a cyber liability insurance program, although the coverage may not be sufficient in some circumstances. While we do not believe that the ultimate consequences of the attack were material to our performance, the occurrence of any similar or other events in the future could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, and could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our performance. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we increasingly are needing to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems and likely will need to invest even more in the future.",
