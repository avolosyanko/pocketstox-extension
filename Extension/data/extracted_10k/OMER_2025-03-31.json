      "text": "ITEM 1.             BUSINESS \nOverview \n \nOmeros Corporation (“Omeros,” the “Company” or “we”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing small-molecule and protein therapeutics for large-market as well as orphan indications targeting immunologic diseases, including complement-mediated diseases and cancers related to dysfunction of the immune system, as well as addictive and compulsive disorders.\nComplement-targeted Therapeutic Development Programs \n \nWe are advancing multiple development programs focused on diseases and disorders associated with the complement system, a group of specialized proteins that protect against invasive pathogens as well as damaged cells inside the body and comprise an important part of the body’s immune system. When triggered, the various components of complement cooperate to generate an immune response that fights infection and clears damaged or dead cells, maintaining healthy function of the body’s systems. However, dysregulation of the complement system (i.e., over- or under-activation) can be harmful and is associated with increased vulnerability to infections and non-infectious diseases, including autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy, and cancer.\n \nThere are three distinct pathways of complement, each activated via one or more unique mechanisms:\n \n\n●   Classical pathway: activated by antigen-antibody complexes\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Lectin pathway: activated by lectin binding of carbohydrate patterns on the surfaces of damaged cells and microbes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Alternative pathway: constitutively active and amplifies classical and lectin pathway activation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nOur complement-targeted therapeutic development programs are primarily focused on diseases and disorders associated with the lectin and/or alternative pathways of complement. Our lectin pathway program includes inhibitors of mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 (“MASP-2”) and our alternative pathway program includes inhibitors of mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 3 (“MASP-3”).\n \nNarsoplimab (OMS721), the lead product candidate in our pipeline of complement-targeted therapeutics, is a proprietary, patented human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of MASP-2, the key activator of the lectin pathway. Clinical development of narsoplimab is currently focused primarily on hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (“TA-TMA”). We are also developing OMS1029, our long-acting antibody and an orally administered small molecule targeting MASP-2 and the lectin pathway.\n \n   1\n\n \n\nThe lead product candidate in our development program focused on the alternative pathway of complement is zaltenibart (OMS906), a proprietary, patented monoclonal antibody targeting MASP-3. MASP-3 is the key and most proximal activator of the alternative pathway of complement. We believe zaltenibart has the potential to treat a wide range of alternative pathway-related diseases and that its attributes favorably differentiate zaltenibart from other marketed and in-development alternative pathway inhibitors. Clinical development of zaltenibart is currently ongoing in multiple alternative pathway-related disorders, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), a rare and life-threatening hemolytic blood disorder, and complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”), a rare chronic kidney disease. A small molecule MASP-3 inhibitor intended for oral administration is also in development.\n \nOther Development Programs\n \nOur development pipeline also includes OMS527, our phosphodiesterase 7 (“PDE7”) inhibitor program focused on addiction and movement disorders. We also have a diverse group of preclinical programs, including an oncology platform directed to development of novel therapeutics across a portfolio of signaling-driven immunomodulators, oncotoxins and an adoptive T-cell technology combined with an immunostimulator.\nOMIDRIA Sale and Royalty Monetization Transactions\n \nWe previously developed and commercialized OMIDRIA® (phenylephrine and ketorolac intraocular solution) 1%/0.3%, which is approved for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens (“IOL”) replacement to maintain pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis (pupil constriction) and to reduce postoperative ocular pain. We marketed OMIDRIA in the United States (the “U.S.”) from the time of its commercial launch in 2015 until December 2021.\n \nOn December 23, 2021, we sold OMIDRIA to Rayner Surgical Inc. (“Rayner”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 1, 2021 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Rayner paid us $126.0 million at the closing and we retained all outstanding accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses as of the closing date. In February 2023, we received a $200.0 million milestone payment from Rayner (the “Milestone Payment”), plus accrued interest, upon an event (the “Milestone Event”) that established separate payment for OMIDRIA for a continuous period of at least four years when furnished in an ambulatory surgery center (“ASC”) setting. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provides for the payment of royalties by Rayner based on Rayner's net sales of OMIDRIA for a term that extends for the life of the patents covering OMIDRIA in the relevant jurisdiction, the longest of which in the United States is currently into 2035. The applicable royalty rates are currently 30% in the United States and 15% outside the United States, subject to reduction upon certain events described in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n \nOn September 30, 2022, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP (“DRI”) under which we received $125.0 million in exchange for a portion of the royalties to which we were entitled from Rayner under the Asset Purchase Agreement on global net sales of OMIDRIA between September 1, 2022 and December 31, 2030, subject to certain annual caps on the royalty amounts payable to DRI.\n \nOn February 1, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”) under which we sold to DRI an expanded interest in the OMIDRIA royalties. The Amendment eliminated the annual caps on royalty payments to which DRI is entitled and provides that DRI will receive all royalties on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA payable between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2031. We received $115.5 million upon closing of the Amendment.Additionally, we are eligible under the Amendment to receive two milestone payments of up to $27.5 million each, payable in January 2026 and January 2028, respectively, based on achievement of certain thresholds for U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA. DRI is entitled to payment only to the extent of royalty payments that are payable on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA on or before December 31, 2031 and DRI has no recourse to our assets other than our interest in the OMIDRIA royalties. Omeros retains the right to receive all royalties payable by Rayner on any net sales of OMIDRIA outside the U.S. payable from and after January 1, 2024, as well as all royalties on global net sales of OMIDRIA payable from and after December 31, 2031. For further discussion, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – OMIDRIA Sale and Royalty Monetization Transactions.”\n \n2024 Term Loan \n \nOn June 3, 2024, we, with certain subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain funds managed by Athyrium Capital Management, LP (collectively, “Athyrium”) and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC (collectively, “Highbridge”) as lenders and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent and collateral agent. We have borrowed approximately $67.1 million under the Credit Agreement and pledged substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, as collateral, subject to customary exceptions, and excluding royalty interests in OMIDRIA and certain related rights. Pursuant to a covenant in the Credit Agreement, we must maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at all times. In addition, the Credit Agreement restricts or places conditions on, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay cash dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, repurchase our 5.25% convertible senior notes due on February 15, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), license certain of our intellectual property on an exclusive basis and engage in significant business transactions such as a change of control. Any of these restrictions could significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities.

Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause diseases characterized by serious tissue injury. Three main pathways can activate the complement system: classical, lectin, and alternative. We are focused on development of therapeutics to treat diseases associated with the lectin and/or alternative pathways of complement. We are developing antibodies as well as small-molecule inhibitors of key enzymes known to be centrally involved in the activation of the targeted pathway of complement.\nMASP-2 Program - Lectin Pathway Disorders\n \nMASP-2, a novel pro-inflammatory protein target, is the effector enzyme of the lectin pathway and is required for the function of this pathway. Omeros is developing antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of MASP-2 as potential therapeutics for diseases in which the lectin pathway has been shown to contribute to significant tissue injury and pathology. When not treated, these diseases are typically characterized by significant end-organ damage, such as kidney or central nervous system injury. Importantly, inhibition of MASP-2 has been demonstrated not to interfere with the antibody-dependent classical complement activation pathway, a critical component of the acquired immune response to infection. In addition to our clinical programs evaluating narsoplimab, we have generated positive preclinical data from MASP-2 inhibition in in vivo models of myocardial infarction, diabetic neuropathy, stroke, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and other diseases and disorders. We own or hold worldwide exclusive licenses to rights related to MASP-2, the antibodies targeting MASP-2 and the therapeutic applications for those antibodies.\n \n\n   4\n\n \n\nNarsoplimab (OMS721)\n \nThe lead product candidate in our pipeline of complement-targeted therapeutics is narsoplimab (OMS721), a proprietary, patented human monoclonal antibody targeting MASP-2. Narsoplimab is in clinical development for several indications.\n \nHematopoietic stem-cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (“TA-TMA”): In March 2025, we resubmitted to FDA a BLA seeking marketing approval for narsoplimab in TA-TMA. FDA has 30 days to decide whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a review of the BLA. Assuming FDA agrees to review the BLA, we expect the resubmission to be classified as Type B, meaning that the target date for FDA action on the BLA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) is expected to be in September 2025. As with any BLA or new drug application, there can be no guarantee that, even if FDA agrees to review the BLA, that FDA will complete its review within a given timeframe, or that our BLA will ultimately be approved.\n \nWe previously submitted a BLA for narsoplimab in TA-TMA, the clinical sections of which were based on results of the pivotal trial of narsoplimab in TA-TMA (OMS721-TMA-001), in which the drug met its primary endpoint of complete response compared to an efficacy threshold, where complete response required clinical improvements in TMA markers (platelet count and lactose dehydrogenase) and in organ function (renal pulmonary, gastrointestinal or neurological) or freedom from transfusion. Despite the success on the primary endpoint and the unmet need in TA-TMA, in October 2021 FDA issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) with respect to the original BLA and indicated that additional information would be needed to support regulatory approval. We appealed FDA’s decision to issue the CRL through a formal dispute resolution process that concluded in late 2022. Although our appeal was denied, the decision identified potential paths for resubmission of the BLA, including paths based on comparison of survival data from the completed pivotal trial versus a historical control group.\n \nBased on the recommendations included in the appeal decision and on subsequent interactions with FDA, we proposed a statistical analysis plan to assess data from our pivotal clinical trial, existing data from a historical control population available from an external source and data from the narsoplimab expanded access program. The proposed protocol and statistical analysis plan were reviewed by FDA, and FDA’s recommendations were incorporated into the final versions. All statistical analyses were conducted by an independent statistical group and the completed analyses are included in the resubmitted BLA for narsoplimab in TA-TMA.\n \nThe primary endpoint under the statistical analysis plan compared to overall survival in the 28 TA-TMA patients that received narsoplimab treatment in the OMS721-TMA-001 pivotal trial to overall survival of more than 100 similarly high-risk TA-TMA patients in an external control registry who did not receive narsoplimab treatment. The OMS721-TMA-001 patients demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant superiority in overall survival – a hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval: 0.23 to 0.44) with p-value less than 0.00001 – compared to the TA-TMA patients in the external registry. The robustness of these results is supported by the sensitivity analyses conducted, and confidence in the results is demonstrated by statistical tests intended to assess potential confounding effects.\n \nAnalyses similar to the primary analysis comparing survival in TA-TMA patients treated with narsoplimab under a global expanded access program (“EAP”) to that of similarly at-risk TA-TMA registry of patients were also included in the analysis plan, along with sensitivity analyses related to each of the primary and EAP comparisons.  \n \nThe EAP-related analyses, which compare survival in narsoplimab-treated adult EAP patients and survival in similarly at-risk TA-TMA patients in the external control registry, further support the robustness and generalizability of the primary analysis results, with representative analyses of the combined EAP and pivotal trial patients yielding hazard ratios ranging from 0.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.53) to 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.60) and p-values ranging from less than 0.00001 to 0.00002. Results of the primary-related and EAP-related sensitivity analyses performed as part of the statistical analysis plan support the robustness of the primary results. The EAP includes adults and children and includes both treatment-naïve patients and patients who failed or stopped treatment for their TA-TMA prior to receiving narsoplimab. Analyses of survival across all of these subgroups of patients treated with narsoplimab show consistently impressive survival results regardless of age or prior treatment status.\n \nIn the U.S., FDA has granted narsoplimab (1) breakthrough therapy designation in patients who have persistent TMA despite modification of immunosuppressive therapy, (2) orphan drug designation for the prevention (inhibition) of complement-mediated TMAs, and (3) orphan drug designation for the treatment of TA-TMA. The European Commission (the “EC”) also granted narsoplimab designation as an orphan medicinal product for treatment in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n \nIn Europe, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has confirmed narsoplimab’s eligibility for the EMA’s centralized review of a single marketing authorization application (“MAA”) that, if approved, authorizes the product to be marketed in all EU member states and European Economic Area countries. We are targeting to complete our MAA submission in the first half of 2025.\n \n\n   5\n\n \n\nCOVID-19 and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”): There is strong and increasingly well-established evidence of the central role of the lectin pathway in COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”), and we have developed mechanistic, in vivo animal data, and proof-of-concept clinical data indicating that narsoplimab may be an effective therapeutic for COVID-19, ARDS and/or related indications. We have also generated compelling data in established animal models across all forms of severe ARDS - bacterial, viral and chemical - and continue to explore the evidence that MASP-2 and the lectin pathway are important drivers of post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 (“PASC”), commonly known as long COVID.\n \nWe have also developed an assay platform to identify hyperactivation of the lectin pathway. Because lectin pathway hyperactivation is correlated with COVID-19-related-ARDS and may be involved in the pathogenesis of other forms of ARDS and/or PASC, the assay may be useful to identify patients with these conditions who are at greatest risk of hospitalization and/or mortality as well as those who are particularly amenable to lectin pathway inhibition therapy for the treatment of one or more of these conditions. We continue to validate the clinical correlation of lectin pathway hyperactivation with COVID-19, ARDS and PASC and to engage in discussions with potential partners as well as with representatives of the U.S. government regarding potential opportunities to obtain funding and advance development of our potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic product candidates for COVID-19, PASC and/or ARDS. \n \nOMS1029\n \nOur lectin pathway program also includes OMS1029, our long-acting antibody targeting MASP-2. This next-generation MASP-2 inhibitor is intended to be complementary to narsoplimab, enabling us to pursue chronic indications in which dosing convenience would be of significant benefit to patients. We have completed Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating both single-ascending and multiple-ascending doses of OMS1029. Data from these trials demonstrated the feasibility of once quarterly, subcutaneous administration, representing a convenient regimen well-suited for chronically dosed indications that can be administered either in health care centers or at home. OMS1029 has been well tolerated to date with no safety concerns identified. We continue to evaluate several potential indications for which Phase 2 clinical development of OMS1029 could be pursued, depending on resource availability. OMS1029 drug product and placebo have been manufactured and stored for future use. Available quantities are expected to be sufficient to support a Phase 2 clinical trial.\n \nMASP-3 Program - Alternative Pathway Disorders\n \nAs part of our program to develop complement-targeted therapeutics, we have identified MASP-3, which has been shown to be the key activator of the complement system’s alternative pathway (“APC”), and we believe that we are the first to make this and related discoveries associated with the APC. The complement system is part of the immune system’s innate response, and the APC is considered the amplification loop within the complement system. MASP-3 is responsible for the conversion of pro-factor D to mature factor D; which is necessary for the activation of the APC. \n \nWe believe that MASP-3 inhibitors have the potential to treat patients suffering from a wide range of diseases and conditions including: PNH; C3G; multiple sclerosis; neuromyelitis optica; age-related macular degeneration; Alzheimer’s disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; diabetic retinopathy; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; anti-phospholipid syndrome; atherosclerosis; myasthenia gravis and others. Several of these indications have been clinically validated by other agents targeting the APC. Our MASP-3 program has also generated positive data in a well-established animal model of arthritis.\n \nZaltenibart (OMS906)\n \nThe lead product candidate in our MASP-3 inhibitor program is zaltenibart (previously referred to as OMS906), a proprietary, patented human monoclonal antibody targeting MASP-3. Clinical development of zaltenibart is ongoing in PNH and C3G. Zaltenibart has been well tolerated to date across all clinical trials, and no safety signal of concern has been identified.\n \n   6\n\n \n\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”): \n \nOur program evaluating zaltenibart in PNH is in Phase 3 of development. Similar to our Phase 2 program, our Phase 3 program includes both a study treating PNH patients who are not receiving treatment with a complement inhibitor, as well as a “switch-over” study in PNH patients who have had an unsatisfactory response to eculizumab and ravulizumab, both of which are inhibitors of complement component 5 (“C5”).\n \nIn the fall of 2024, we met with FDA and European regulators to discuss further details of our planned Phase 3 program for zaltenibart in PNH. With both regulatory agencies, we discussed data developed from our clinical and nonclinical programs to date and our Phase 3 development plans for zaltenibart in PNH. Both regulatory agencies agreed with the trial designs and provided other valuable feedback to inform our development plans.\n \nBoth studies in our Phase 3 program are designed to provide head-to-head comparisons with the C5 inhibitors and could produce data demonstrating the superiority of zaltenibart over the C5 inhibitors in these patient populations. These data could form the basis for comparative superiority claims for promotion, enhanced market access, and pricing reflective of zaltenibart’s advantages. We also sought and received recommendations regarding patient-reported-outcome measures from the German Federal Joint Committee, which determines availability of reimbursement from statutory health insurance funds in that country and which has specialized expertise in patient-reported-outcome measures. Recommended patient-reported-outcome measures were incorporated into the zaltenibart Phase 3 program and are expected to be helpful in securing appropriate pricing in relevant jurisdictions.\n \nClinical site activation in our Phase 3 program for PNH has begun. All zaltenibart drug product needed for our Phase 3 programs has been manufactured and active comparator drug has been sourced. A total of 120 clinical investigative sites across 30 countries have been chosen for clinical trial participation in the zaltenibart Phase 3 program in PNH. A number of these sites have already identified pools of PNH patients ready to participate in the zaltenibart trials, and Omeros continues collaborating with sites to identify additional eligible and already available PNH patients.\n \nOur Phase 2 development program evaluating zaltenibart for PNH consists of three studies. A study in PNH patients who have had an unsatisfactory response to the C5 inhibitor ravulizumab has been completed. A study in PNH patients who have not previously been treated with a complement inhibitor is ongoing under protocol amendments intended to produce additional data on the zaltenibart dose selected for Phase 3 development. The third clinical trial in our Phase 2 program evaluating zaltenibart in PNH is an ongoing open-label extension study to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of zaltenibart in patients who have completed any of our PNH clinical trials. Data from the extension study are expected to contribute to any future marketing applications for zaltenibart in the treatment of PNH. \n \nResults from a pre-specified interim analysis in our Phase 2 clinical trial of zaltenibart in complement-inhibitor-naïve adults with PNH were featured in a podium presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December 2023. The interim analysis results showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in all measured markers of hemolysis, including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. This study was amended to gather additional data on the zaltenibart dose selected for Phase 3 development and remains ongoing for this purpose.\n \nThe last patient visit in our Phase 2 trial evaluating two doses of zaltenibart in PNH patients who have had an unsatisfactory response to the C5 inhibitor ravulizumab occurred in October 2024. Utilizing a “switch-over” design, this study enrolled PNH patients receiving ravulizumab, added zaltenibart to provide combination therapy with ravulizumab for 24 weeks, and then, in those patients who demonstrated a hemoglobin response with the combination therapy, switched to zaltenibart monotherapy. In June 2024, efficacy data from a pre-specified interim analysis of the combination therapy portion of the trial were featured in a podium presentation at the annual congress of the European Hematology Association held in Madrid, Spain. The interim analysis showed that the addition of zaltenibart therapy to ravulizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both mean hemoglobin levels and absolute reticulocyte counts by week 4 of combination therapy, with a sustained response observed through week 24 (the latest assessment prior to the interim analysis cutoff). All 13 enrolled patients were included in the interim analysis. All patients in the high-dose group achieved clinical response, defined as an increase in hemoglobin of at least 2 grams, and six of seven patients in the low-dose group achieved this same clinical response. Data from the monotherapy portion of the trial were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December 2024. Twelve of 13 enrolled patients continued to the second stage of the study. The interim results from the monotherapy stage of the study showed that in PNH patients experiencing substantial extravascular hemolysis while receiving ravulizumab, zaltenibart monotherapy resulted in sustained clinically meaningful improvements in both hemoglobin and absolute reticulocyte count and prevented both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.\n \nZaltenibart received designation from FDA as an orphan drug for the treatment of PNH in July 2022. \n \nComplement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”): We also have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical program evaluating zaltenibart for the treatment of C3G, a rare and debilitating renal disease driven by complement dysregulation. Notably, the relevance of the alternative pathway to C3G has been clinically validated in two Phase 3 trials with other inhibitors of the alternative pathway that reported positive results in the treatment of C3G. Sites for the zaltenibart Phase 2 trial in C3G are open to enrollment in multiple countries and dosing in the study is ongoing. We are amending the study to include a cohort of patients with C3G who have normal plasma C3 levels and evidence of renal inflammation in their urine, which represents a large proportion of the total C3G population. Our Phase 2 study in C3G requires enrollment of a relatively small number of patients and we expect to complete the study later this year. Following completion of the Phase 2 study, and assuming strong evidence of efficacy, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in C3G.\n \nIn October 2024, zaltenibart received a rare pediatric disease designation from FDA for the treatment of C3G. Companies awarded a rare pediatric disease designation are eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher from FDA if the designated drug's first approval is for the associated indication in the pediatric population and certain other criteria are met. Absent legislative reauthorization and extension of the priority review voucher program for rare pediatric disease, one of the criteria for receipt of a voucher under the current law is that the drug must be approved by September 30, 2026. The holder of a priority review voucher is entitled to obtain a priority review by FDA of either a new drug application or a biologics license application for a different product and/or indication, reducing the review time and accelerating any grant of approval and subsequent market entry by at least four months. The voucher may be used by the original recipient, or it can be sold for use to another company. \n \nPreclinical Complement Inhibitor Programs\n \nWe have also directed efforts to development of small-molecule inhibitors of MASP-2 and MASP-3 designed for oral administration. In our MASP-2 small-molecule inhibitor program, we continue to develop and assess preclinical data on our selected drug candidate. Our MASP-3 small-molecule inhibitor is advancing toward selection of a drug development candidate.\nOther Clinical Programs\n \nPDE7 Inhibitor Programs - OMS527\n \nOur PDE7 inhibitor program, which we refer to as OMS527, comprises multiple PDE7 inhibitor compounds and is based on our discoveries of previously unknown links between PDE7 and any addiction or compulsive disorder, and between PDE7 and any movement disorders. PDE7 appears to modulate the dopaminergic system, which plays a significant role in regulating both addiction and movement. We believe that PDE7 inhibitors could be effective therapeutics for the treatment of addictions and compulsions as well as for movement disorders. Data generated in preclinical studies support the use of PDE7 inhibitors in both of these therapeutic areas.\nCocaine Use Disorder (“CUD”): In April 2023, we were awarded a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”), part of the National Institutes of Health, and requested by NIDA to develop our lead orally administered PDE7 inhibitor compound for the treatment of CUD. The award, for a total of $6.24 million over three years is intended to fund an in-patient, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of OMS527 in adults with CUD who receive concurrent intravenous cocaine, as well as prerequisite cocaine-OMS527 interaction safety studies in which the OMS527 therapeutic candidate was co-administered with cocaine in two animal species to rule out enhancement of the detrimental effects of cocaine.\n \nIn the OMS527-cocaine interaction studies, OMS527, when administered at two different doses in combination with cocaine, did not produce an additive or synergistic effect on the convulsive threshold of cocaine in rats or on the adverse cocaine-induced cardiovascular responses in non-human primates. Instead, the higher doses of OMS527 generally lessened the severity of effects noted following intravenous administration of cocaine, most notably decreasing convulsant-related activity following the administration of cocaine.\n \nBased on the successful outcome of the preclinical studies, NIDA has provided the Company with a funding commitment for the year commencing April 1, 2025 in the amount of $4.02 million. This amount is expected to fund the inpatient clinical trial assessing safety and efficacy of the lead OMS527 compound in adult patients with CUD. Readout of preliminary data from that study is targeted by year-end 2025.\n \nIn a previously completed Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy human subjects the lead OMS527 compound was well tolerated with no safety signal of concern and displayed favorable pharmacokinetics, supporting once daily dosing in the dose range expected to produce efficacy in humans.\n \nLevodopa-induced dyskinesia (“LID”): With investigators at Emory University, we are also evaluating an OMS527 PDE7 inhibitor as a potential treatment for LID, which are involuntary and often crippling movements in patients with Parkinson’s disease that are caused by prolonged treatment with levodopa, the most prescribed therapy for Parkinson’s disease. More than 10 million patients are living with Parkinson’s disease worldwide. Reportedly 50 percent or more of levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson’s disease suffer from LID.\n \nWe hold an exclusive license to certain PDE7 inhibitors claimed in patents and pending patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (“Daiichi Sankyo”), as successor-in-interest to Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd. for use in the treatment of movement, addiction and compulsive disorders as well as other specified indications. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, see “License and Development Agreements” below.\n \n   7\n\n \n\nPPARγ Program - OMS405\n \nIn our peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (“PPARγ”) program, we have engaged in development of proprietary compositions that include PPARγ agonists for the treatment and prevention of addiction to substances of abuse, which may include opioids, nicotine and alcohol. We believe that Omeros is the first to demonstrate a link between PPARγ and addiction disorders. Data from clinical studies and from animal models of addiction suggest that PPARγ agonists could be efficacious in the treatment of a wide range of addictions.\n \nOur collaborators at The New York State Psychiatric Institute have completed two Phase 2 clinical trials related to our PPARγ program. These studies evaluated a PPARγ agonist, alone or in combination with other agents, for treatment of addiction to heroin and to nicotine. The published results of the heroin study demonstrated that, although not altering the reinforcing or positive subjective effects of heroin, the PPARγ agonist significantly reduced heroin craving and overall anxiety. NIDA provided substantially all of the funding for these clinical trials and solely oversaw the conduct of these trials. We have the right or expect to be able to reference the data obtained from these studies for any future FDA submission and continue to retain all other rights in connection with the PPARγ program.\n \nWe have also reported positive results (i.e., decreased cravings and protection of brain white matter) from a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by an independent investigator evaluating the effects of a PPARγ agonist in patients with cocaine use disorder. An investigator-sponsored study evaluating the effects of a PPARγ agonist on the prevention of relapse following treatment of cocaine use disorder is ongoing. The study is funded by NIDA.\n \nWe own patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights related to our PPARγ program, as described under “Intellectual Property” below.\n \n   8\n\n \n\nPreclinical Programs and Platforms\n \nOncology Platform\n \nThe objective of our oncology program is to move beyond existing targeted biologics, such as antibody-drug conjugates (“ADC”), which have small therapeutic indexes and limited tissue penetrance, and beyond engineered cellular-therapies, such as CAR-T cells, which are expensive and time-consuming. Building on our understanding of immunity, both innate, e.g., complement-mediated, and adaptive, meaning B-cells as well as CD4 and CD8 T-cells, we are developing a portfolio of next generation biologics to treat cancer. It consists of new modalities of targeted drug conjugates, with better therapeutic indexes and better tissue penetrance, which we believe could eventually sideline the current ADC technology. Our portfolio also includes an adoptive T-cell technology combined with an immunostimulator that is easier, faster and cheaper than current cellular therapy approaches. Our technology also maintains an enhanced anti-cancer immune response through subsequent repetitive and simple therapeutic administrations.\n \nOur oncology development program is operating in stealth mode as we continue to confirm our results and to generate new data which we expect will contribute to our intellectual property position. \n \nSales and Marketing\n \nWe have retained all worldwide marketing and distribution rights to our product candidates and our development programs. As such, we will be able to market any product candidate that is approved in the future independently, through arrangements with third parties, or via some combination of these approaches.\n \nIf narsoplimab is approved for marketing in the United States for treatment of TA-TMA, we expect to utilize an internal sales force to sell the product. We have hired a head of sales for narsoplimab, along with regional leaders of our planned U.S. sales force and intend to begin hiring specialty sales representatives for U.S. field sales upon reaching certain milestones associated with FDA’s review of our BLA for narsoplimab. If our anticipated MAA for narsoplimab in TA-TMA is approved by the EMA, we intend to enter into partnerships and/or commercial services arrangements with third-parties to market and sell narsoplimab in Europe and are currently evaluating various potential arrangements for commercialization in Europe.\n \nManufacturing, Supply and Commercial Operations\n \nWe have laboratories in-house for analytical method development, bioanalytical testing, formulation, stability testing and small-scale compounding of laboratory supplies of product candidates; however, we do not own or operate internal manufacturing facilities capable of producing sufficient quantities of our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) for use in clinical studies, or for the manufacture of narsoplimab for commercial use following potential regulatory approval.\n \nWe utilize contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of product candidates for use in preclinical and clinical studies and to store and distribute our product candidates. We require manufacturers that produce bulk drug substance and finished drug products for clinical use to operate in accordance with cGMP and all other applicable laws and regulations. We anticipate that we will rely on contract manufacturers to develop and manufacture our product candidates for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.\n \n   9\n\n \n\nIn July 2019, we entered into a master services agreement with Lonza Biologics Tuas Pte. Ltd. (“Lonza”) for the commercial production of narsoplimab and for certain regulatory support and related services to be provided by Lonza from time to time. Under the agreement Lonza will manufacture narsoplimab pursuant to purchase orders issued in accordance with certain forecast and confirmation procedures specified in the contract. We will purchase narsoplimab that meets agreed specifications in batches, with the price per batch varying according to the total number of batches ordered for serial production in a single manufacturing campaign. We are obligated to purchase a minimum number of batches annually beginning on a specified anniversary of the first commercial sale of narsoplimab in either the U.S. or EU. We may be obligated to pay certain fees to Lonza upon cancellation of purchase orders. The initial term of the agreement expires five years after the first commercial sale of narsoplimab in either the U.S. or EU and is subject to automatic renewal for an additional four-year term unless we provide notice of non-renewal at least three years prior to the end of the initial term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement, subject to applicable notice and cure periods under certain circumstances. \n \nWe have a Combined Development and Commercial Supply Agreement, effective May 16, 2018, with Vetter Pharma International, GmbH (“Vetter”) under which the process for manufacturing of sterile liquid vials pre-filled with finished narsoplimab was developed and validated, and pursuant to which Vetter has agreed to aseptically fill narsoplimab in vials for clinical or commercial use. Under the agreement, we must provide Vetter with non-binding rolling forecasts of our long-term supply requirements on a periodic basis and submit purchase orders for filled narsoplimab vials intended for commercial use for confirmation by Vetter within an agreed time before the anticipated delivery date. Pricing for commercial manufacturing services varies based on the number of batches ordered and may be adjusted periodically, subject to limitations specified in the agreement. For commercial-stage manufacturing, each batch ordered must be for a quantity of finished units that is at least equal to a specified minimum but no more than a specified maximum per batch. We may be obligated to pay certain fees to Vetter upon cancellation purchase orders or in connection with postponement of batches subject to a purchase order. The agreement is effective with respect to the commercial work contemplated thereunder for an initial term five years after which it automatically renews for two-year terms unless either party notifies the other party at least 12 months before the end of the then-current term that it does not intend to renew. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, subject to applicable notice and cure periods. \n \nIn addition to our agreements with Lonza and Vetter, we utilize a third-party vendor for labelling and final packaging of narsoplimab finished goods. We expect to utilize one or more wholesalers for distribution of narsoplimab, if approved in the U.S. for commercial sale.\n \nWe have not entered into commercial supply agreements for any of our product candidates other than narsoplimab.\n \n\nLicense and Development Agreements\n \nMASP-3. In August 2020, we entered into a technology license agreement with Xencor, Inc., pursuant to which we received an exclusive license to apply Xencor’s Xtend Fc technology to zaltenibart and options to access exclusive licenses to apply Xtend Fc technology to additional antibodies (the “Xencor Agreement”). Exercise of an option to access additional licenses would require payment of a $3.0 million upfront license fee. With respect to each antibody for which we license the Xencor technology we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $65.0 million, comprised of $15.0 million in development milestones, $25.0 million in regulatory milestones and $25.0 million in sales milestones. In August 2023, we paid $5.0 million to Xencor in connection with the achievement of a development milestone in our zaltenibart program. We expect that an additional $10.0 million milestone payment will become due during 2025, pending the anticipated achievement later this year of an additional clinical development milestone in our zaltenibart program. We are obligated on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis to pay Xencor royalties in the mid-single digit percentage range on net sales of any product covered by the license so long as there is a valid, subsisting and enforceable claim in any patents or patent applications covering the licensed technology. Thereafter, the royalty rate is reduced to the low single-digit percentage range, if the applicable licensed product is covered by Xencor know-how, or to zero, if the applicable licensed product is not covered by Xencor know-how. The term of the Xencor Agreement continues on a product-by-product basis until the later of (i) expiration for the last-to-expire patent covering the licensed technology or (ii) five years from the date of first commercial sale of the applicable product.\n \n   10\n\n \n\nPDE7. Under an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, we hold an exclusive worldwide license to PDE7 inhibitors claimed in certain patents and pending patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo for use in the treatment of (1) movement disorders and other specified indications, (2) addiction and compulsive disorders and (3) all other diseases except those related to dermatologic conditions. Under the agreement, we agreed to make milestone payments to Daiichi Sankyo of up to an aggregate total of $33.5 million upon the achievement of certain events in each of these three fields; however, if only one of the three indications is advanced through the milestones, the total milestone payments would be $23.5 million. The milestone payment events include successful completion of preclinical toxicology studies; dosing of human subjects in Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials; receipt of marketing approval of a PDE7 inhibitor product candidate; and reaching specified sales milestones. In addition, Daiichi Sankyo is entitled to receive from us a low single-digit percentage royalty of any net sales of a PDE7 inhibitor licensed under the agreement by us and/or our sublicensee(s) provided that, if the sales are made by a sublicensee, then the amount payable by us to Daiichi Sankyo is capped at an amount equal to a low double-digit percentage of all royalty and specified milestone payments received by us from the sublicensee.\n \nThe term of the agreement with Daiichi Sankyo continues so long as there is a valid, subsisting and enforceable claim in any patents covered by the agreement. The agreement may be terminated sooner by us, with or without cause, upon 90 days advance written notice or by either party following a material breach of the agreement by the other party that has not been cured within 90 days or immediately if the other party is insolvent or bankrupt. Daiichi Sankyo also has the right to terminate the agreement if we and our sublicensee(s) cease to conduct all research, development and/or commercialization activities for a PDE7 inhibitor covered by the agreement for a period of six consecutive months, in which case all rights held by us under Daiichi Sankyo’s patents will revert to Daiichi Sankyo.\n \n   11\n\n \n\nCompetition\n \nOverview. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as smaller companies like ours. We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may:\n \n●  develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer than our future products;\n \n●  commercialize competing products before we can launch our products;\n \n●  operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;\n \n●  initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;\n \n●  have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;\n \n●  more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and\n \n●  take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.\n \nWe expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. Further, our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively.\n \n   12\n\n \n\nProduct Candidates, Development Programs and Platforms. There are a number of complement-targeted therapeutics that are in advanced stages of clinical development, or which have been approved for commercial use. These include Soliris® (eculizumab), Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwvz), Empaveli® (pegcetacoplan), Tavneos® (avocopan), PiaSky® (crovalimab-akkz), Voydeya (danicopan) and Fabhalta® (iptacopan). Narsoplimab, OMS1029 and/or zaltenibart will face competition from branded and/or generic versions of one or more of these products if approved for any indication(s) for which one or more of these potentially competitive products are also approved or for which a potentially competitive product is used off-label to treat a relevant condition.\nIntellectual Property \n \nWe have retained control of all worldwide manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights for each of our product candidates and programs. Some of our product candidates and programs are based on inventions and other intellectual property rights that we acquired through assignments, exclusive licenses or acquisitions described in further detail under “License and Development Agreements” above.\n \nAs of March 31, 2025, we owned or held worldwide exclusive licenses to a total of 81 issued patents and 64 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 1,443 issued patents and 655 pending patent applications in foreign markets directed to therapeutic compositions and methods and other technologies related to our research and development programs. For each program, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including one or more of the following: our available resources, the size of the commercial market, the presence of a potential competitor or a contract manufacturer in the market and whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights.\n \n●  MASP-2 Program - Narsoplimab (OMS721) and OMS1029. We own and hold worldwide exclusive licenses to rights in connection with MASP-2, antibodies targeting MASP-2, small-molecule MASP-2 inhibitors, and related therapeutic applications. As of March 31, 2025, we exclusively controlled 42 issued patents and 33 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 861 issued patents and 474 pending patent applications in foreign markets, related to our MASP-2 program, including narsoplimab and our second-generation MASP-2 antibody OMS1029. Our MASP-2-related patents have terms that will expire as late as 2038 and, if currently pending patent applications are issued, as late as 2043.\n●  MASP-3 Program - Zaltenibart (OMS906). We own and exclusively control rights in connection with MASP-3, antibodies targeting MASP-3 and related therapeutic applications. We also hold an exclusive license from Xencor, Inc. for the application of certain antibody technology to zaltenibart, as well as the option to obtain additional licenses to such technology for exclusive application to additional antibodies that we may select. As of March 31, 2025, we exclusively controlled five issued patents and eight pending patent applications in the U.S. and 212 issued and 109 pending patent applications in foreign markets that are related to our MASP-3 program. Our MASP-3-related patents have terms that will expire as late as 2037 and, if currently pending patent applications are issued, as late as 2043.\n \n●  PPARγ Program - OMS405. As of March 31, 2025, we owned three issued patents and one pending patent application in the U.S., and 42 issued patents and one pending patent application in foreign markets, directed to our discoveries linking PPARγ and addictive disorders. Our PPARγ-related patents have terms that will expire as late as 2030.\n \n●  PDE7 Program - OMS527. As of March 31, 2025, we owned two issued patents and two pending patent applications in the U.S., and 61 issued patents and seven pending patent applications in foreign markets directed to our discoveries linking PDE7 to movement disorders, as well as three issued patents and two pending patent applications in the U.S., and 54 issued patents and six pending patent applications in foreign markets directed to the link between PDE7 and addiction and compulsive disorders. Additionally, under a license from Daiichi Sankyo, we exclusively control rights to two issued U.S. patents and 53 issued patents in foreign markets that are directed to proprietary PDE7 inhibitors. Our PDE7-related patents have terms that will expire as late as 2031 and, if currently pending patent applications are issued, as late as 2043. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, see “License and Development Agreements” above.\n \n   13\n\n \n\n●  Oncology Program. Our oncology program comprises novel platforms and technologies related to potential therapies for cancer. We are operating the oncology program in stealth mode as we continue to confirm our results and to generate new data which we expect will contribute to our intellectual property position. As of March 31, 2025, we had two patent applications pending in the U.S. directed to a potential cancer therapeutic derived from our oncology platform.\n \nAll of our employees enter into our standard employee proprietary information and inventions agreement, which includes confidentiality provisions and provides us ownership of all inventions and other intellectual property made by our employees that pertain to our business or that relate to our employees’ work for us or that result from the use of our resources. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of the use, formulation and structure of our product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as on our ability to defend successfully these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.\n \nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S., and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that we own or have licensed or in third-party patents.\n \nWe have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademark “OMEROS”, as well as the associated “alpha/omega” logo within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and various foreign jurisdictions in connection with the products and services we offer. We also have registered and pending trademark applications within the USPTO and in certain foreign jurisdictions directed to the trademark “YARTEMLEA”, the brand name under which we expect to market narsoplimab if the drug is approved for commercial sale. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our trademarks in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction.\n \nGovernment Regulation \n \nGovernment authorities in the U.S., the EU and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of drug and biologic products including the product candidates that we are developing. Failure to comply with applicable requirements, both before and after receipt of regulatory approval, may subject us, our third-party manufacturers, and other partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, a delay in approving or refusal to approve pending applications, civil and other monetary penalties, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions.\n \nIn the U.S., our product candidates are regulated by FDA as drugs or biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations and under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). In the EU, our product candidates are regulated by the EMA and national medicines regulators under the rules governing medicinal products in the EU as well as national regulations in individual countries. Our product candidates are in various stages of testing and none of our product candidates has received marketing approval from FDA or the applicable regulatory authorities in the EU.\n \n   14\n\n \n\nThe steps required before a product may be approved for marketing by FDA, or the applicable regulatory authorities outside of the U.S., typically include the following:\n \n●  formulation development and manufacturing process development;\n \n●  preclinical laboratory and animal testing;\n \n●  submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; in the EU Member States and in European Economic Area countries a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) is submitted to the Clinical Trials Information System; in other countries outside of the U.S. and Europe, a CTA is filed according to the country’s local regulations;\n \n●  adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of the product for each indication for which approval is sought;\n \n●  adequate assessment of drug product stability to determine shelf life/expiry dating;\n \n●  in the U.S., submission to FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), in the case of a drug product, or a BLA in the case of a biologic product and, in Europe, submission to the EMA or a national regulatory authority of an MAA;\n \n●  satisfactory completion of inspections of one or more clinical sites at which clinical trials with the product were carried out and of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), and cGMP; and\n \n●  FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA, or review and approval of an MAA by the applicable regulatory authorities in the EU.\n \nManufacturing. Manufacturing of drug products for use in clinical trials must be conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines, for example, cGMP. Process and formulation development are undertaken to design suitable routes to manufacture the drug substance and the drug product for administration to animals or humans. Analytical development is undertaken to obtain methods to quantify the potency, purity and stability of the drug substance and drug product as well as to measure the amount of the drug substance and its metabolites in biological fluids, such as blood.\nPreclinical Tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, clinical development plan, and other available information are submitted as part of an IND or CTA.\nThe IND/CTA Process. An IND or CTA must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. INDs are extensive submissions including, among other things, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include one or more protocols for proposed clinical trials detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. An IND will become effective 30 days after receipt by FDA unless, before that time, FDA raises concerns or questions and imposes a clinical hold. In that event, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before the clinical hold is lifted and clinical trials can proceed. Similarly, a CTA must be cleared by the local independent ethics committee and competent authority prior to conducting a clinical trial in the country in which it was submitted. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND or CTA will result in authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND or CTA is in effect, there are certain reporting requirements.\n \n   15\n\n \n\nClinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified personnel and must be conducted in accordance with local regulations and GCP. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, for example, the parameters to be used in monitoring patient safety and the efficacy criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board or ethics committee for each clinical site at which the trial will be conducted before it can begin. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined:\n \n●  Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational product to human subjects, who may or may not have the disease or condition for which the product is being developed, to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacodynamics and, if possible, to gain an early indication of the effectiveness of the product.\n \n●  Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population with the disease or condition for which the product is being developed to evaluate appropriate dosage, to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and to evaluate preliminarily the effectiveness of the product for specific indications.\n \n●  Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate and confirm effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the product in its final form in an expanded patient population.\n \nWe, our product development partners, institutional review boards or ethics committees, FDA or other regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\n \nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information. Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on ClinicalTrials.gov, a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of an applicable clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of such trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Clinical trials conducted in European countries are required to be registered at a similar public database maintained and overseen by European health authorities. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.\n \nThe Application Process. If the necessary clinical trials are successfully completed, the results of the preclinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to FDA in the form of an NDA or a BLA, as applicable, and to the EMA or national regulators in the form of an MAA, requesting approval to market the product for a specified indication. In the EU, an MAA may be submitted to the EMA for review and, if the EMA gives a positive opinion, the EC may grant a marketing authorization that is valid across the EU (centralized procedure). Alternatively, an MAA may be submitted to one or more national regulators in the EU according to one of several national or decentralized procedures. The type of submission in Europe depends on various factors and must be cleared by the appropriate authority prior to submission. For most of our product candidates, the centralized procedure will be either mandatory or available as an option.\n \nIf the regulatory authority determines that the application is not acceptable, it may refuse to accept the application for filing and review, outlining the deficiencies in the application and specifying additional information needed to file the application. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the regulatory authority ultimately may decide that the proposed product is not safe or effective, or that the application does not otherwise satisfy the criteria for approval. In the U.S., to support an approval an NDA must demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed drug product is safe and effective, has a favorable benefit-risk profile, is manufactured in a way that preserves its identity, strength, purity and potency, and that its labeling is adequate and not false or misleading. A similar standard exists for BLAs. Before approving an NDA or BLA, or an MAA, FDA or the EMA, respectively, may inspect one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical studies were conducted to ensure that GCP were followed and may inspect facilities at which the product is manufactured to ensure satisfactory compliance with cGMP. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendation. In addition, even if a product candidate satisfied its endpoints with statistical significance during clinical trials, FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses and/or subject to restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations. If approval is obtained changes to the approved product such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims will require submission of a supplemental application, referred to as a variation in the EU, or, in some instances, a new application, for further review and approval. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any future approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.\n \n   16\n\n \n\nSome of our product candidates, such as those from our MASP-2 and MASP-3 programs, are considered biologics because they are proteins that are greater than 40 amino acids in size. The added complexity associated with manufacturing biologics may result in additional monitoring of the manufacturing process and product changes.\n \nIn addition, we, our suppliers and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with extensive regulatory requirements both before and after approval. For example, we must establish a pharmacovigilance system and are required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the regulatory authorities. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will be required to also comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. The regulatory authorities may impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization, such as additional safety monitoring, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-marketing safety studies, or the imposition of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), which could include significant restrictions on distribution or use of the product. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems such as safety issues may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or marketing authorization holder, including removal of the product from the market.\n \nFast-Track and Priority Review Designations. Section 506(b) of the FDCA provides for the designation of a drug as a fast-track product if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. A program with fast-track status is afforded greater access to FDA for the purpose of expediting the product’s development, review and potential approval. Many products that receive fast-track designation are also considered appropriate to receive priority review, and their respective applications may be accepted by FDA as a rolling submission in which portions of an NDA or BLA are reviewed before the complete application is submitted. Together, these may reduce time of development and FDA review time. In Europe, products that are considered to be of major public health interest are eligible for accelerated assessment, which shortens the review period. The grant of fast-track status, priority review or accelerated assessment does not alter the standard regulatory requirements for obtaining marketing approval.\n \nBreakthrough Therapy Designation. In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. This law established a regulatory process allowing for increased interactions with FDA with the goal of expediting development and review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.\n \n   17\n\n \n\nAccelerated Approval. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In both cases, FDA must take into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Studies that are conducted to demonstrate a drug’s effect on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint for accelerated approval must be adequate and well-controlled as required by the FDCA.\n \nFollowing accelerated approval, FDA requires that companies conduct confirmatory studies post-approval to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. FDA may also impose restrictions on distribution to assure safe use. Pursuant to statutory authority under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, FDA can require confirmatory studies to be underway at the time of the accelerated approval. If the required confirmatory studies fail to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the drug, or if the applicant fails to perform the required confirmatory studies with due diligence, FDA may withdraw approval of the drug under expedited procedures. FDA may also withdraw approval of a drug if, among other things, other evidence demonstrates that the drug product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use.\n \nThe EU also has accelerated approval programs. In the EU, a marketing authorization may be granted on the basis of less complete data than are normally required in certain “exceptional circumstances,” such as when the product’s indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive data. Alternatively, a conditional marketing authorization may be granted prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for a full MAA if a product fulfills an unmet medical need and the benefit to public health of the product’s immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the incomplete data.\n \nOrphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act (“ODA”), FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the applicable disease or condition is not likely to be recovered from U.S. sales for that product. The grant of orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements (other than payment of certain fees and the applicability of certain pediatric assessment requirements), nor does it alter the standards or process for obtaining marketing approval. The sponsor of a product that has an orphan drug designation qualifies for various development incentives specified in the ODA, including a tax credit of up to 25% of expenditures on qualified clinical testing for the orphan drug. Furthermore, if the orphan designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the orphan indication, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means that FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity for the protected indication. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. The EU has a similar Orphan Drug program to that of the U.S., and it is administered through the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.\nPediatric Testing and Exclusivity. In the U.S., NDAs and BLAs are subject to both mandatory pediatric testing requirements and voluntary pediatric testing incentives in the form of exclusivity. An additional six months of exclusivity in the U.S. may be granted to a sponsor of an NDA or BLA if the sponsor conducts certain pediatric studies, which studies are conducted pursuant to a written request from FDA. This process is initiated when FDA issues a Written Request for pediatric studies to determine if the drug or biologic could have meaningful pediatric health benefits. If FDA determines that the sponsor has conducted the requested pediatric studies in accordance with the written request, then an additional six months of exclusivity may attach in the case of a drug to any other regulatory exclusivity or patent protection applicable to the drug and, in the case of a biologic, to any other regulatory exclusivity applicable to the biologic. The EU has a similar requirement and incentive for the conduct of pediatric studies according to the pediatric investigation plan, which must be adopted by the EMA before an MAA may be submitted.\n \n   18\n\n \n\nExpanded Access. “Expanded access” refers to the use of an investigational drug where the primary purpose is to diagnose, monitor, or treat a patient’s disease or condition rather than to collect information about the safety or effectiveness of a drug. There are three FDA-recognized categories of expanded access trials: expanded access for individual patients, including for emergency use; expanded access for intermediate-size patient populations; and expanded access for large patient populations under a treatment IND or treatment protocol. For all types of expanded access, FDA must determine prior to authorizing expanded access that: (1) the patient or patients to be treated have a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy; (2) the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of use and that the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and (3) granting the expanded access will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical studies in support of the drug’s approval. Only a licensed physician or the drug’s manufacturer may apply for expanded access. Manufacturers are not required to supply the investigational product for expanded access. The FDA has established streamlined processes for physicians to request individual patient expanded access whereby physicians can submit a single patient IND. In cases of individual patient emergency expanded access, physicians can receive FDA approval for access by phone and follow up with the abbreviated form. In addition, the sponsor of an expanded access IND must submit IND safety reports and, in the cases of protocols continuing for one year or longer, annual reports to FDA.\n \nU.S. Labeling, Marketing and Promotion. The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. In general, our labeling and promotion must not be false or misleading in any particular, and claims that we make must be adequately substantiated. In addition, our approved labeling must include adequate directions to physicians for each intended use of our products. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties.\n \nIn addition to regulation by FDA, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products in the U.S. are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by prison sentences, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\n \nThere are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information or impose other special requirements for the sale and marketing of drug products. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, federal and state “transparency laws” require manufacturers to track and report certain payments made to health care providers and, under some state laws, other information concerning our products. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.\n \nDrug Supply Chain Security Act. Title II (the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”)), of the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which began a several-year phase-in process in 2015. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers subject to the DSCSA are required to provide certain documentation regarding the drug product to trading partners to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier (i.e., serialize), respond to verification requests from trading partners, provide transaction documentation upon request by federal or state government entities, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers must be done electronically. For products and transactions falling within DSCSA’s scope, manufacturers are required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under the DSCSA, covered manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities for product that is reasonably believed or that credible evidence shows to be counterfeit, diverted, stolen, intentionally adulterated such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death, the subject of fraudulent transactions or otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Anti-counterfeiting and serialization requirements similar to those under the DSCSA have also been adopted in the EU and became effective in February 2019.\n \n   19\n\n \n\nForeign Regulatory Requirements. Outside of the U.S., our ability to conduct clinical trials or market our products will also depend on receiving the requisite authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The foreign regulatory approval processes include similar requirements and many of the risks associated with FDA and/or the EU approval process described above, although the precise requirements may vary from country to country.\n \nHatch-Waxman Act. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or an approved method of use of the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) application. In this case the original NDA, i.e., the pioneer drug, is known as the “listed” drug or “reference-listed” drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug that has the same active ingredients and, in some cases, also the same inactive ingredients, in the same strengths, route of administration and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug or receives a waiver from bioequivalence testing. ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are considered therapeutically equivalent, and are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug. These drugs then generally can be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.\n \nThe ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to FDA concerning any patents listed for the referenced approved drug in FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, for each listed patent, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant does not include a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired, except for any listed patents that only apply to uses of the drug not being sought by the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.\n \nIf the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has made a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must also send a Paragraph IV Notice Letter to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV Notice Letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV Notice Letter automatically prevents FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, modification by a court or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.\n \nThe ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference-listed drug has expired. The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was supported by new clinical trials other than bioavailability studies that were essential to the approval and conducted by or for the sponsor. During those three years of exclusivity, FDA cannot grant approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected dosage form, route of administration or combination, or use of that listed drug.\n \n   20\n\n \n\nIn December 2019, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (“CREATES Act”) was signed into law. The legislation is intended to address the concern that some brand manufacturers have improperly denied generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. The CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on commercially reasonable, market-based terms. If the developer prevails, the court may grant the developer a monetary award up to the brand product’s revenue for the period of delay in providing samples.\n \nBiosimilars. The enactment of federal healthcare reform legislation in March 2010 provided a new pathway for approval of follow-on biologics (i.e., biosimilars) under the PHSA. FDA licensure of a biosimilar is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the proposed biosimilar is “highly similar” to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. The types of data ordinarily required in a biosimilar application to show high similarity include analytical data, animal studies (including toxicity studies), and clinical studies (including immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies). A biosimilar must seek licensure for a condition of use for which the reference-listed product is licensed.\n \nFurthermore, the PHSA provides that for a biosimilar to be considered “interchangeable” (i.e., the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product), the applicant must make an additional showing that the biosimilar can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once to a patient, that risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biological product and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without switching. Although FDA has provided guidance on what information and data an applicant should submit to enable an interchangeability determination, thus far FDA has not licensed any biologic as being interchangeable with its reference product.\n \nThe PHSA also provides a period of exclusivity for pioneer biologics. Specifically, FDA may not accept a biosimilar application referencing data from a pioneer biologic (i.e., one approved through a full BLA) until four years have elapsed from the date of first licensure of the pioneer biologic. FDA may not approve a biosimilar application referencing data from a pioneer biologic until 12 years have elapsed since the date of first licensure of the pioneer biologic. There are certain restrictions and limitations on the types of BLAs that are eligible for biologics exclusivity as well as what constitutes the date of first licensure for a pioneer biologic.\n \nIn the EU, a pathway for the approval of biosimilars has existed since 2005.\n \nHealthcare compliance laws. In the U.S., commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, is subject to regulation and enforcement under a number of federal and state healthcare compliance laws administered and enforced by various agencies. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \n●  the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offering or paying anything of value to a person or entity to induce or reward referrals for goods or services reimbursed by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n \n●  the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, and which has been interpreted to also include claims caused by improper drug-manufacturer product promotion or the payment of kickbacks;\n \n●  a variety of governmental pricing, price reporting, and rebate requirements, including those under Medicaid and the Veterans Health Care Act; and\n \n   21\n\n \n\n●  the so-called Sunshine Act and certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which require that we report to the federal government information on certain financial payments and other transfers of value made to certain health care providers and institutions, as well as certain information regarding our distribution of drug samples.\n \nIn addition to these federal law requirements, several U.S. states have enacted similar laws requiring periodic reporting and/or disclosure related to our marketing, sales and other activities, or regulating certain sales and marketing activities, such as provision of meals to certain health care providers. We may also be subject to federal or state privacy laws if we receive protected patient health information or consumer health information.\n \nSimilar requirements apply to our operations outside of the U.S. Laws in the U.S. such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibit the offering or payment of bribes or inducements to foreign public officials for business, including physicians or other medical professionals who are employees of public healthcare entities. In addition, many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, or may operate in the future, have their own laws similar to the healthcare compliance laws that exist in the U.S.\n \nPharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement \n \nOverview. In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers including, in the U.S., managed care organizations and other private health insurers as well as governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend on a number of factors, including the payer’s determination that use of a product is:\n \n●  a covered benefit under its health plan;\n \n●  safe, effective and medically necessary;\n \n●  appropriate for the specific patient;\n \n●  cost-effective; and\n \n●  neither experimental nor investigational.\n \nReimbursement by government payers is based on statutory authorizations and complex regulations that may change with annual or more frequent rulemaking, as well as legislative reform measures.\n \nThird-party private and governmental payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost-effectiveness in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products or product candidates. Even with the availability of such studies, third-party private and/or governmental payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.\n \nUnited States. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business. For example, legislation imposed a two percent across-the-board reduction to Medicare payments to providers, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will begin to increase gradually starting in April 2030, reaching 4 percent in April 2031 and continuing until the reduction ends in October 2031, unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. \n \n   22\n\n \n\nContainment of healthcare costs has been a priority of federal, state, and foreign governments, and the prices of drug products have been a focus of this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs. This interest has resulted in significant proposed and enacted reform measures affecting healthcare reimbursement and drug pricing, including the enactment in August 2022 of significant changes to potential Medicare drug product reimbursement through government negotiation of certain drug prices, as well as Medicare manufacturer discount and inflation rebate obligations under the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”).\n \nWe are unable to predict what additionallegislation, regulations, policies, executive orders or court orders, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or coverage and reimbursement may be enacted or imposed in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations, policies or court orders would have on our business. Any cost-containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial operations.\n \nEurope. Governments in the various member states of the EU influence or control the price of medicinal products in their countries through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials or pharmacoeconomic studies that assess the cost-effectiveness of a product or product candidate relative to currently available therapies or relative to a specified standard. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription medicines in particular, has become very intense and is creating increasingly high barriers to the entry of new products in these markets.\nResearch and Development\n \nWe have built a research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical and medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team. We strive to make disciplined strategic decisions regarding our research and development programs and to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles and, when appropriate, as we advance our programs to commercialization. We engage third parties on a limited basis to conduct portions of our preclinical research; however, we are not substantially dependent on any third parties for our preclinical research nor do any of these third parties conduct a major portion of our preclinical research. We also engage multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials and rely on third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) to coordinate and execute aspects of clinical trial operations. None of these CROs or clinical sites are responsible for the major portion of our clinical trials and we are not substantially dependent on any one of them.\nEmployees \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 202 full-time employees, 136 of whom are in research and development, 19 of whom are in sales and marketing and 47 of whom are in finance, legal, business development and administration. Our full-time employees include seven with M.Ds and 41 with Ph.Ds., of whom six and 40, respectively, are in research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.\n \n   23\n\n \n\nInformation about Our Executive Officers and Significant Employees\n \nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers and significant employees as of March 13, 2025:\n \n\n               Name                     Age                                        Position(s)                                     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExecutive Officers:                                                                                                                \nGregory A.

      "text": "ITEM 1A.            RISK FACTORS \n \nThe risks and uncertainties described below may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. In addition, we may be adversely affected by risks that we currently deem immaterial or by other risks that are not currently known to us. You should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRisks Related to Our Product Candidates, Programs and Operations\n \nManagement has concluded that a substantial doubt is deemed to exist concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.\n \nAs further discussed in Part II, Item 8, “Note 1—Organization and Basis of Presentation” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern through one year from the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to generate positive cash flow from operations, obtain additional financing, enter into strategic alliances and/or sell assets.  Our limited cash resources, which are impacted by a covenant in the Credit Agreement requiring us to maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at all times, and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital, enter into strategic alliances and/or make our scheduled debt payments on a timely basis or at all. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\n \nWe have incurred cumulative operating losses since inception. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or to continue our other preclinical development programs. \n \nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our incorporation, As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $90.1 million. Our cash used in operations was $148.8 million and our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $156.8 million. Pursuant to a covenant in the Credit Agreement, we must maintain $25.0 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at all times. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to:\n \n●  initiate and conduct clinical trials and manufacture clinical and registration batches for our product candidates;\n \n●  continue our research and development in our programs;\n \n●  make principal, interest and fee payments as required under our 2026 Notes; \n \n●  make interest payments under the initial term loan of $67.1 million provided pursuant to the Credit Agreement (the “Initial Term Loan”); and\n \n●  commercialize and launch product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\n \nWe expect to continue to incur additional losses until such time as we generate significant revenue from the sale of commercial products or from partnerships. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses and cannot provide assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue from commercial products in the future to fund our operations fully. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from commercialized products or partnership arrangements, we may never become and remain profitable and will be required to raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, when required. Adverse developments to our financial condition or business, as well as disruptions in the global equity and credit markets, may limit our ability to access capital. In addition, pursuing debt financings, certain equity offerings or other strategic transactions may result in mandatory prepayments of the Initial Term Loan. If we do not raise additional capital when needed through one or more funding avenues, such as debt or equity financings or corporate partnering, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our preclinical programs or other research and development initiatives. In addition, we may be required to seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future products at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than otherwise might be available or to relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. We also may have insufficient funds or otherwise be unable to advance our preclinical programs to a point where they can generate revenue through partnerships, collaborations or other arrangements. Any of these actions could limit the amount of revenue we are able to generate and harm our business and prospects.\n \nOur Credit Agreement places restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility and could, if we were to default, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to retain title to our assets.\n \nWe have borrowed approximately $67.1 million under the Credit Agreement and pledged substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, as collateral. The Credit Agreement restricts or places conditions on, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay cash dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, repurchase our 2026 Notes, license certain of our intellectual property on an exclusive basis and engage in significant business transactions such as a change of control. Any of these restrictions could significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. The failure to satisfy these or other obligations under the Credit Agreement could constitute an event of default, which could provide the lenders with a right to accelerate our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement and to take control of our pledged assets, which includes substantially all of our intellectual property assets. Upon acceleration of the Credit Agreement, we would be required to repay outstanding amounts immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration through negotiation or litigation. In addition, if an acceleration event were to occur under the Credit Agreement and not be cured, the trustee or the holders of the 2026 Notes would have the right to accelerate our repayment obligations for all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2026 Notes then outstanding. If we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under the 2026 Notes and Credit Agreement, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and we would lose title to substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. In any related proceeding, the lenders’ right to repayment under the Credit Agreement would be senior to the right of repayment of the holders of the 2026 Notes and the rights of both would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. Any event of default could accordingly have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause the price of our 2026 Notes and common stock to decline significantly.\n \nIn addition to our Credit Agreement, our other indebtedness and liabilities and any future indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $97.2 million total aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes outstanding, $67.1 million total aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Initial Term Loan, and we had approximately $2.0 million of outstanding finance lease obligations. We may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. As described above, our Credit Agreement places restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and our other existing and future indebtedness could also have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n \n● requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service and repay our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n \n● limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n \n● limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n \n● diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes;\n \n● placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than we are or have better access to capital; and\n \n● increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\n \nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including economic, financial, competitive and other circumstances beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that further limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\n \n   27\n\n \n\nFailure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from commercializing and marketing our product candidates.\n \nThe regulatory process is subject to substantial agency discretion and risks, including those described herein and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors.” In October 2021, we received a CRL from FDA regarding our BLA for narsoplimab for the treatment of TA-TMA. In the CRL, FDA expressed difficulty in estimating the treatment effect of narsoplimab in TA-TMA and asserted that additional information would be needed to support regulatory approval. We appealed FDA’s decision to issue the CRL through a formal dispute resolution process that concluded in late 2022. Although our appeal was denied, the decision identified a potential path for resubmission of the BLA based on inclusion of certain additional information and analyses. Based on the decision and on subsequent interactions with FDA, we proposed a statistical analysis plan to assess data from our pivotal clinical trial, existing data from an historical control population available from an external source and data from the narsoplimab expanded access program. The primary endpoint under the analysis plan is patient survival in our pivotal narsoplimab trial compared to that in an external registry of TA-TMA patients who were not treated with narsoplimab. Analyses similar to the primary analysis comparing survival in TA-TMA patients treated with narsoplimab under a global EAP to that of similarly at-risk TA-TMA registry patients were also included in the analysis plan, along with sensitivity analyses related to each of the primary and EAP comparisons. All statistical analyses were conducted by an independent statistical group. These data and analyses are included in our recently resubmitted BLA for narsoplimab in TA-TMA. We expect also to include these data and analyses in the MAA for narsoplimab in this indication.\n \nWe cannot guarantee when or if FDA or EMA will approve narsoplimab for the treatment of TA-TMA. Even if our clinical data, data from our EAP and statistical analyses comparing these data to an external registry of TA-TMA patients provide favorable evidence of the effectiveness of narsoplimab in the treatment of TA-TMA, the reviewing agency may determine that such evidence is insufficient to support regulatory approval for any reason, including unfavorable interpretation of our analysis results, potential differences between the diagnostic criteria used in our pivotal trial and in the external registry, a determination by the reviewing agency that the registry used in our statistical analysis is insufficiently representative of TA-TMA patients to provide a reliable control, FDA’s assessment of the comparability of the registry to the population in our pivotal trial, the sufficiency of our sensitivity analyses, and/or the lack of additional control sources. Additionally, we do not currently have narsoplimab manufacturing slots scheduled with our contract manufacturing partner and, if a pre-licensing inspection is requested in connection with agency review of our BLA or MAA, we may face difficulty in securing manufacturing capacity to support such inspection at reasonable cost, or at all, our manufacturing partner may also fail to provide other needed regulatory support on a timely basis, or at all. Any difficulties associated with our contract manufacturer’s support in connection with regulatory processes could prevent or delay review and approval of our marketing application. Overall, the requirements for resubmission of our BLA have been and may continue to be costly, require significant time and may not result in approval. Ultimately, we cannot guarantee that FDA or EMA will ever approve narsoplimab for the treatment of TA-TMA or any other indication.\n \nWe also intend to market outside the U.S. any of our product candidates that are approved in the future. In order to market our products in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we or our partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The regulatory approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and data review. The requirements governing marketing authorization, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Approval by FDA does not ensure approval by the EMA, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other foreign countries or by FDA. The time required to obtain regulatory approval outside the U.S. and EU may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EU approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval discussed in these “Risk Factors” and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, even if we were able to obtain regulatory approval for a product in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we may need to complete additional requirements to maintain that approval and our ability to market the product in the applicable jurisdiction.\n \nIf any product that we develop and commercialize does not receive adequate coverage or reimbursement from governments and/or private payers our prospects for revenue and profitability would suffer.\n \nThe success of any product that we or our third-party business partners commercialize in the future will depend heavily on the pricing, availability and duration of adequate coverage or reimbursement for any such product from government, private and other third-party payers, both in the U.S. and in other countries.\n \nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage or reimbursement for newly approved products, and we may not be able to provide data sufficient to be granted adequate coverage or reimbursement. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, coverage may be limited to the uses of a product that are either approved by FDA (or, in other countries, the relevant country’s regulatory agency) and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium, or other conditions may apply. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not mean that any product will be reimbursed at a rate that allows us to make a profit or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, sales and distribution. Increasingly, government and private third-party payers that reimburse for healthcare services and products are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products, which could adversely impact the pricing of our products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, including as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. Pricing may also be adversely affected by changes in the terms, scope and/or complexity of government pricing requirements. Even if we achieve coverage or reimbursement for a product, the initial rate or method at which the product will be reimbursed could become unfavorable to us at the time reimbursement is initiated or in the future or may be of a limited duration. In addition, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer.\n \n   28\n\n \n\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate reimbursement approvals and comply with related foreign legal and regulatory requirements. In some countries, including those in the EU, our products may be subject to government price controls. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take a considerable amount of time and expenditure of resources after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. We provide no assurances that the price of any product in one or more of these countries or regions will allow us to make a profit or cover our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, sales and distribution, and as a result we may decide to delay, potentially indefinitely, initiating sales in the particular country or region.\n \nIf the reimbursement or pricing that we are able to obtain and maintain for any product that we develop and commercialize is inadequate, is significantly delayed or is subject to overly restrictive conditions, our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability and/or commercialize our product candidates may be impaired and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects and the trading price of our stock could decline.\n \nOur ability to meet our future capital requirements is partially dependent on certain milestone and royalty payments that we are eligible to receive based on Rayner’s sales of OMIDRIA, and, if sales of OMIDRIA are less than anticipated and/or Rayner is unable to expand sales of OMIDRIA outside the U.S., our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, the price of our common stock may decline and we may be unable to access needed capital on favorable terms, or at all.\n \nIn February 2024, we sold to DRI an expanded interest in OMIDRIA royalties payable by Rayner. Pursuant to the Amendment with DRI, DRI is entitled to receive all royalties on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2031. We retain the right to receive all royalties payable by Rayner on any net sales of OMIDRIA outside the U.S. as well as royalties on global net sales of OMIDRIA payable from and after December 31, 2031. We received $115.5 million upon closing of the Amendment. Additionally, we are eligible under the Amendment to receive two milestone payments of up to $27.5 million each, payable in January 2026 and January 2028, respectively, based on achievement of certain thresholds for U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA.\n \nThe royalty rate payable by Rayner on net sales of OMIDRIA is currently 30% in the United States and 15% outside the U.S. The royalty rate is subject to further reduction to 10% of U.S. net sales upon the occurrence of certain events, including during any specific period in which OMIDRIA is no longer eligible for separate payment. The availability of royalties from Rayner and/or milestone payments from DRI is dependent on Rayner’s net sales of OMIDRIA and may be of lesser magnitude than anticipated or may not become payable at all. We cannot provide assurance that royalty income from Rayner and/or milestone payments from DRI, if they become payable, will be a meaningful source of capital in the future. Sales-based royalty income and milestone payments may be affected by any number of factors, including:\n \n●  Rayner’s ability to successfully market and sell OMIDRIA in the U.S.;\n \n●  whether, and to what extent, Rayner is able to expand sales of OMIDRIA outside the U.S.;\n \n●  pricing, coverage and reimbursement policies of government and private payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, group purchasing organizations, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators;\n \n●  a lack of acceptance by physicians, patients and other members of the healthcare community;\n \n●  interruptions in the supply of OMIDRIA;\n \n●  the availability, relative price and efficacy of the product as compared to alternative treatment options or branded, compounded or generic competing products;\n \n●  an unknown safety risk; and\n \n●  changed or increased regulatory restrictions in the U.S., EU and/or other foreign territories.\n \nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate.\n \nOur operating results are difficult to predict and will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n \n●  the extent and magnitude of certain payments to which we may be entitled based on Rayner’s net sales of OMIDRIA may be affected by the extent of coverage and reimbursement for OMIDRIA, market acceptance of the product and Rayner’s ability to execute an effective sales strategy;\n \n●  the extent of any payments received from any collaboration agreements or development funding arrangements that we may enter into from time to time, as well as the extent of any payments that we are required to make under existing or future collaboration and license agreements, which may include sales-based royalties and milestone payments based on the achievement of development, regulatory and sales milestones and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter;\n \n●  the timing, cost and level of investment in our research and development activities as well as expenditures we may incur to acquire or develop additional technologies, product candidates, or in preparation for potential commercialization of our product candidates; and\n \n●  whether we are able to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, the extent and timing of revenue from sales of any such approved product and the magnitude and timing of expenses associated with the manufacturing and sale of any such approved product.\n \nAny of these risk factors, should one or more occur, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\n \n   29\n\n \n\nSignificant changes to the size, structure, powers and operations of the U.S. federal government, as well as recent policy actions by the U.S. federal government, may cause economic disruptions that could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\n \nThe new administration has begun to implement significant changes to the size and scope of the federal government to achieve stated goals including reducing the federal budget deficit and national debt, improving the efficiency of government operations, and promoting innovation and economic growth. To date, these efforts have been carried out through a mix of executive actions aimed at eliminating or modifying federal agency and federal program funding, reducing the size of the federal workforce, reducing or altering the scope of activities conducted by, and possibly eliminating, various federal agencies and bureaus. If implemented, these changes may have varied effects on the economy that are difficult to predict. For instance, the delivery of government services and the distribution of federal program funds and benefits may be disrupted or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of funding cuts, recasting of federal agency mandates or a substantial reduction of the federal workforce. We rely on the availability, predictability and efficiency of federal agencies including FDA, NIDA and others in connection with the operation of our business and programs. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by disruptions affecting these or other agencies in areas relevant to our programs and operations.\n \nIn addition, recent policy actions by the new U.S. administration, including the imposition of new tariffs on imported materials and goods from certain foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and China, and the temporary freeze on federal grants and loans, may have an adverse impact on our business. Increased tariffs on critical raw materials, components, and finished goods could raise our production costs, disrupt our supply chain, and reduce our competitiveness in the marketplace. Additionally, the administration's halt on certain federal research grants may negatively impact our industry. Any prolonged reductions in such funding could slow innovation, delay collaborations, and limit the adoption of new technologies that contribute to our business growth. If these or similar policy changes continue or expand, we may face increased costs. Although we cannot predict the full extent of these impacts, any prolonged disruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n \nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and the failure to comply with these regulations may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\n \nBoth before and after approval of any product, we and our suppliers, contract manufacturers and clinical investigators are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries, covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, clinical trials, post-marketing studies, reporting, risk management plans, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import and export, governmental pricing, price reporting and rebate requirements. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in one or more of the following actions: warning letters; unanticipated expenditures; delays in approval or refusal to approve a product candidate; product recall or seizure; interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials; operating or marketing restrictions; injunctions; criminal prosecution and civil or criminal penalties including fines and other monetary penalties; adverse publicity; and disruptions to our business. Further, government investigations into potential violations of these laws would require us to expend considerable resources and face adverse publicity and the potential disruption of our business even if we are ultimately found not to have committed a violation.\n \nObtaining FDA approval of our product candidates requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and may be subject to both expected and unforeseen delays, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on any of our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. As was the case with our BLA for narsoplimab in TA-TMA, with respect to which FDA issued a CRL, even after collaborating closely with FDA or regulators with corollary responsibilities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. regarding the contents of a marketing application a regulator may decide that the design of our clinical trials or clinical data collection protocols as actually run, or our resulting data, are insufficient for approval of our product candidates. FDA or other regulators may require us to run additional preclinical, clinical or other studies or perform additional work related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls. In addition, we, FDA or an independent institutional review board or ethics committee may suspend or terminate human clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are or would be exposed to an unacceptable health risk or because of the way in which the investigators on whom we rely carry out the trials. We are subject to extensive government regulation of the testing of our investigational products, including the requirement that we conduct all of our clinical trials in accordance with FDA’s GCP requirements and similar requirements outside of the U.S. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, if we are required to conduct additional trials or to conduct other testing of our product candidates beyond that which we currently contemplate for regulatory approval, if we are unable to complete our clinical trials or other testing successfully, or if the results of these and other trials or tests fail to demonstrate efficacy or raise safety concerns, we may face substantial additional expenses, be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or may never obtain marketing approval.\n \nWe are also required to comply with extensive governmental regulatory requirements after a product has received marketing authorization. Governing regulatory authorities may require post-marketing studies that may negatively impact the commercial viability of a product. Once on the market, a product may become associated with previously undetected adverse effects and/or may develop manufacturing difficulties. We are required to comply with other post-marketing requirements including cGMP, advertising and promotion restrictions, pharmacovigilance requirements including risk management activities, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and other requirements. As a result of any of these or other problems or failure to comply with our regulatory obligations, a product’s regulatory approval could be withdrawn, which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, we must maintain an effective healthcare compliance program in order to comply with U.S. and other laws applicable to marketed drug products and, in particular, laws (such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and the Sunshine Act) applicable when drug products are reimbursed by a federal or state healthcare program. U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibit the offering or payment of bribes or inducements to foreign public officials, including potentially physicians or other medical professionals who are employees of public healthcare entities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, many countries have their own laws similar to the healthcare compliance laws that exist in the U.S. Implementing and maintaining an effective compliance program requires the expenditure of significant time and resources. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including but not limited to civil or criminal penalties, damages and fines as well as exclusion from government healthcare programs.\n \nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations as well as future legislation, including as a result of the new U.S. administration.\n \nExisting regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\n \n   30\n\n \n\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare resulting from the IRA or other legislative or policy changes or from other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. These healthcare reforms and the implementation of any future cost containment measures or other reforms may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain and/or maintain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes, including as a result of the U.S. administration, will be enacted, whether existing legislation will be implemented, interpreted or enforced as anticipated or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our product candidates, if any, may be.\n \nWe have no internal capacity to manufacture commercial or clinical supplies of our product candidates and intend to continue to rely solely on third-party manufacturers, which could significantly limit or delay our clinical trials or regulatory submissions and may negatively impact our financial conditions and results of operations. If we are unable to establish relationships with contract manufacturers that have sufficient manufacturing capacity available to meet our needs, or if the contract manufacturers that we rely on experience difficulties manufacturing and supplying our product candidates, or fail FDA or other regulatory inspections, then our clinical trials or regulatory submissions may be significantly limited or delayed or we may have inadequate supply to meet demand for any product that we commercialize in the future.\n \nWe rely and intend to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce quantities of clinical drug supplies of our product candidates that are needed for clinical trials and to support NDAs, BLAs, or similar applications to regulatory authorities seeking marketing approval for our product candidates, as well as to produce inventory of our product candidates for commercial use in anticipation of marketing approval. Global demand for contract manufacturing is volatile and the available supply of contract manufacturing capacity is limited and unpredictable. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to enter into or maintain these types of arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that manufacturing arrangements will meet our requirements. Our contract manufacturers previously have and may in the future require us to place orders or make other financial commitments several years in advance of manufacturing commencement based on forecasts of our long-term commercial supply requirements for product candidates that have not yet received, and may never receive, regulatory approval. We may be required to pay significant cancellation fees or other financial penalties in connection with the withdrawal or cancellation of any binding order for manufacturing that we later determine is not needed. The fees or other financial obligations that we may incur in connection with withdrawn or cancelled orders may be material and any such financial penalty would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nIf we or one of our manufacturers were to terminate one of these arrangements early, or the manufacturer was unable to supply product quantities sufficient to meet our requirements, we would be required to transfer manufacturing to an approved alternative facility and/or establish additional manufacturing and supply arrangements. We may also need to establish additional or replacement manufacturers, potentially with little or no notice, in the event that one of our manufacturers fails to comply with FDA and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturing regulatory requirements. Even if we are able to establish additional or replacement manufacturers, identifying these sources and entering into definitive supply agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals may require a substantial amount of time and cost and may create a shortage of the product. It can take several years to qualify and validate a new contract manufacturer, and we cannot guarantee that we would be able to complete in a successful and timely manner the appropriate validation processes or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for one or more additional or replacement manufacturers. Such alternate supply arrangements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, if we are unable to engage multiple suppliers to manufacture our products, we may have inadequate supply to meet demand for our product.\n \nIn addition, narsoplimab, zaltenibart and OMS1029 are biologic drug products and other product candidates from certain of our programs, including but not limited to MASP-2 and MASP-3, could be biologic drug products. We do not have the internal capability to produce biologics for use in clinical trials or on a commercial scale. There are only a limited number of manufacturers of biologic drug products and we may be unable to enter into agreements on commercially reasonable terms with a sufficient number of them to meet clinical or commercial demand, if at all. The regulatory requirements for commercial supply are more stringent than for clinical supply and we cannot guarantee that a contract manufacturer producing drug product for clinical trials will be able to complete successfully the appropriate validation processes or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for marketing approval and commercial supply in a timely manner or at all.\n \n   31\n\n \n\nOur contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties with formulation, manufacturing, supply chain and/or release processes that could result in delays in clinical trials and/or regulatory submissions or that could impact adversely the commercialization of our products or product candidates, as well as in the initiation of enforcement actions by FDA and other regulatory authorities. For example, our manufacturers are required to comply with FDA’s GMP requirements and are subject to periodic inspections by FDA. If our manufacturers are unable to comply with FDA requirements, they may be unable to meet our supply needs. These difficulties also could result in the recall or withdrawal of a product from the market or a failure to have adequate supplies to meet market demand. If the safety or manufacturing quality of any product candidate supplied by contract manufacturers is compromised due to one or more of those contract manufacturers’ failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to maintain regulatory approval to run clinical trials or to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which would harm our business and prospects significantly.\n \nAny significant delays in the manufacture and/or supply of clinical or commercial supplies could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n \nIngredients, excipients, test kits and other materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may adversely affect the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n \nWe and our third-party manufacturers must obtain from third-party suppliers the APIs, excipients, and/or other raw materials plus primary and secondary packaging materials necessary for our contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials and, to the extent approved or commercialized, for commercial distribution. Although we have entered or intend to enter into agreements with third-party suppliers that will guarantee the availability and timely delivery of APIs, excipients, test kits and materials for our product candidates, we have not entered into agreements for the supply of all such ingredients, excipients, test kits or materials, and we may be unable to secure all such supply agreements or guarantees on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to secure such agreements or guarantees, our suppliers may be unable or choose not to provide us the ingredients, excipients, test kits or materials in a timely manner or in the quantities required. Further, if we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to obtain APIs, excipients, test kits and materials as necessary for our clinical trials or for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates, if approved, potential regulatory approval or commercialization would be delayed, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates. \n \n   32\n\n \n\nIf our clinical trials or clinical protocols are delayed, suspended or terminated, we may be unable to develop our product candidates on a timely basis, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of approved products.\n \nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials or clinical data collection protocols that will cause regulatory agencies, institutional review boards or ethics committees, or us to delay our clinical trials or suspend or delay the analysis of the data from those trials. Clinical trials and clinical data protocols have been, and in the future can be, delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n \n●  discussions with FDA, the EMA or other foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or clinical data collection protocols;\n \n●  delays or the inability to obtain required approvals from institutional review boards, ethics committees or other responsible entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n \n●  delays in enrolling patients into clinical trials, collecting data from enrolled patients or collecting historical control data for any reason including disease severity, trial or data collection protocol design, study eligibility criteria, patient population size (e.g., for orphan diseases or for some pediatric indications), proximity and/or availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients, availability of competing therapies and clinical trials, regional differences in diagnosis and treatment, perceived risks and benefits of the product or product candidate, disruptions due to external events or conditions affecting the localities or regions in which our clinical trials are conducted, such as terrorism, political crises, natural disasters, war and wartime conditions, such as those in Ukraine, which has affected the operation of our clinical trials of zaltenibart, or outbreaks of contagious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which previously slowed enrollment in our clinical trials of narsoplimab;\n \n●  lower than anticipated retention rates of patients in clinical trials;\n \n●  the need to repeat or conduct additional clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results, failure to replicate positive early clinical data in subsequent clinical trials, failure to deliver an efficacious dose of a product candidate, poorly executed testing, a failure of a clinical site to adhere to the clinical protocol or to follow GCP or other study requirements, an unacceptable study design or other problems;\n \n●  adverse findings in clinical or nonclinical studies related to the safety of our product candidates in humans;\n \n●  an insufficient supply of product candidate materials or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n \n●  the need to qualify new suppliers of product candidate materials for FDA and foreign regulatory approval;\n \n●  an unfavorable inspection or review by FDA or other regulatory authority of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical investigation;\n \n●  the occurrence of unacceptable drug-related side effects or adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n \n●  the suspension by a regulatory agency of a trial by imposing a clinical hold; or\n \n●  the amendment of clinical trial or data collection protocols to reflect changes in regulatory requirements and guidance or other reasons as well as subsequent re-examination of amendments to clinical trial or data collection protocols by regulatory agencies, institutional review boards or ethics committees.\n \n   33\n\n \n\nIn particular, because PNH and C3G, the indications for which our ongoing clinical trials are evaluating zaltenibart, are rare conditions, we have opened and expect to continue opening clinical sites in Ukraine and other countries that may be affected by armed conflict or political instability or that have not been traditionally established as centers for clinical research. Like Ukraine, some of these areas have been, and may continue to be, affected by such conflict, instability and/or health infrastructure challenges. Enrollment and retention of patients in, or the ability to receive results from, these clinical trials could be disrupted by the existing conditions in these areas or other geopolitical or macroeconomic developments. If patients withdraw from our trials, miss scheduled doses or follow-up visits or otherwise fail to follow trial protocols, if we are unable to resupply the drugs to clinical sites on schedule, or if our trial results are otherwise disrupted or disputed due to such conditions and developments, the integrity of data from our trials may be compromised or not accepted by FDA or other regulatory authorities, which would represent a significant setback for the development of this product candidate.\n \nIn addition, our clinical trial or development programs have been, and in the future may be, suspended or terminated by us, FDA or other regulatory authorities, or institutional review boards or ethics committees due to a number of factors, including:\n \n●  failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n \n●  inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n \n●  our failure to comply with our regulatory obligations as a sponsor of clinical research, such as adverse event reporting, control of study drug, adequate study monitoring, and other obligations;\n \n●  the failure to remove a clinical hold in a timely manner, if at all;\n \n●  unforeseen safety issues or any determination that a trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n \n●  inability to deliver an efficacious dose of a product candidate; or\n \n●  lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or development program, including as a result of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and/or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs, or other third parties.\n \nIf the results of our clinical trials are not available when we expect or if we encounter any delay in the analysis of data from our clinical trials, we may be unable to file for regulatory approval or conduct additional clinical trials on the schedule we currently anticipate. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our development costs, could slow down our product development and regulatory submission process, could delay our receipt of product revenue and could make it difficult to raise additional capital. In addition, significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our future products, potentially harming our business.\n \nBecause we have a number of product candidates and development programs, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications for which there is a greater likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval and that may be more profitable, if approved.\n \nWe have limited resources and must focus on the product candidates and clinical and preclinical development programs that we believe are the most promising. As a result, we may forgo or delay the pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential and may not be able to progress development programs as rapidly as otherwise possible. Further, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug through collaboration, license or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\n \nOur product candidates may not successfully complete clinical development or be suitable for successful commercialization or generation of revenue through partnerships, and our preclinical programs may not produce product candidates that are suitable for clinical trials.\n \nWe must successfully complete preclinical testing, which may include demonstrating efficacy and the lack of toxicity in established animal models, before commencing clinical trials for any product candidate. Many pharmaceutical and biological product candidates do not successfully complete preclinical testing. There can be no assurance that positive results from preclinical studies will be predictive of results obtained from subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trials.\n \n   34\n\n \n\nEven if preclinical testing is successfully completed, we cannot be certain that any product candidates that do advance into clinical trials will successfully demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials. Even if we achieve positive results in early clinical trials, they may not be predictive of the results in later trials, and safety and/or efficacy outcomes of early clinical trials may not be consistent with outcomes of subsequent clinical trials. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize our current or future product candidates or to meet our expectations with respect to revenues or profits from such products.\n \nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of commercial disputes, claims, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our business operations, especially with regard to patent and other intellectual property rights, and such costs or an adverse outcome in such a proceeding may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\n \nOur business involves numerous commercial contractual arrangements, important intellectual property rights, potential product liability, uncertainties with respect to clinical development, manufacture and regulatory approvals and other aspects that create heightened risks of disputes, claims and legal proceedings. These include claims that may be faced in one or more jurisdictions related to the safety of our product candidates, the development of our product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our expectations regarding product development and regulatory approval, sales and marketing practices, commercial disputes including with contract manufacturers, competition, environmental matters, employment matters and other matters. These matters could consume significant time and resources, even if we are successful. Many of our competitors and contractual counterparties are significantly larger than we are and, as a result, may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, we may pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue our operations.\n \nWe may initiate or become subject to litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement litigation involves many complex technical and legal issues and its outcome is often difficult to predict and the risk involved in doing so can be substantial. Manufacturers of generic or biosimilar drugs could seek approval to market a generic or biosimilar version of our products or challenge our intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates.\n \nFurther, our industry has produced a large number of patents and it is not always clear which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. A third party may claim that we or our contract manufacturers are using inventions covered by the third party’s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in the alleged infringing activity, including making, using or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we, or our contract manufacturers, are infringing the third party’s patents and would order us or our contractors to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, if we or our contract manufacturers are found to have violated a third party’s patent, we or our contract manufacturers could be ordered to pay damages to the other party. We have agreed or may in the future agree to indemnify our contract manufacturers against certain patent infringement claims and thus may be responsible for any of their costs associated with such claims and actions. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we might be unable to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\n \nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\n \nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for the use, formulation and structure of our product candidates, the methods used to manufacture them, the related therapeutic targets and associated methods of treatment as well as on successfully defending these patents against potential third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.\n \n   35\n\n \n\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Further, the determination that a patent application or patent claim meets all of the requirements for patentability is a subjective determination based on the application of law and jurisprudence. The ultimate determination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or by a court or other trier of fact in the U.S., or corresponding foreign national patent offices or courts, on whether a claim meets all requirements of patentability cannot be assured. Although we have conducted searches for third-party publications, patents and other information that may affect the patentability of claims in our various patent applications and patents, we cannot be certain that all relevant information has been identified. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or patent applications, in our licensed patents or patent applications or in third-party patents.\n \nWe cannot provide assurances that any of our patent applications will be found to be patentable, including over our own prior art patents, or will issue as patents. Neither can we make assurances as to the scope of any claims that may issue from our pending and future patent applications nor to the outcome of any proceedings by any potential third parties that could challenge the patentability, validity or enforceability of our patents and patent applications in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions. Any such challenge, if successful, could limit patent protection for our product candidates and/or materially harm our business.\n \nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for one of our product candidates or in the event that such patent protection expires or is limited to method of use patent protection, it may no longer be cost-effective to extend our portfolio by pursuing additional development of a product or product candidate for follow-on indications.\n \nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies or product candidates, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\n \n\n   36\n\n \n\nCompetitors may develop products that are less expensive, safer or more effective, or which may otherwise diminish or eliminate the success of any products that we may commercialize.\n \nWe may not achieve commercial success if our competitors, many of which have significantly more resources and experience than we have, market products that are safer, more effective, less expensive or faster to reach the market than any products that we may develop and commercialize. Our competitors also may market a product that proves to be unsafe or ineffective, which may affect the market for future product we are developing, regardless of the safety or efficacy of our product. The failure of any future product that we may market to compete effectively with products marketed by our competitors would impair our ability to generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\n \nThe loss of members of our management team could substantially disrupt our business operations.\n \nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The members of our management team are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies other than on the life of Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D., our president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors. Losing the services of any key member of our management team, whether from death or disability, retirement, competing offers or other causes, without having a readily available and appropriate replacement could delay the execution of our business strategy, cause us to lose a strategic partner, or otherwise materially affect our operations.\n \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively.\n \nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, many of whom possess specialized expertise that may be difficult to replace. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. If we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified employees for any reason, we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively. We maintain a rigorous, highly selective and time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has significantly contributed to our success to date. If we do not succeed in attracting qualified personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our existing operations may suffer and we may be unable to grow effectively.\n \n   37\n\n \n\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could delay our business plans or adversely affect our results of operations.\n \nTo manage our future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems and continue to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel. We may not be able to implement necessary business processes and systems, recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel and otherwise manage the growth of our enterprise due to factors such as limited financial resources and competition for qualified personnel within local, national and international markets. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. Additionally, our inability to manage growth effectively could cause our operating costs to exceed our forecasts.\n \nProduct liability claims may damage our reputation and, if insurance proves inadequate, these claims may harm our business.\n \nWe may be exposed to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the biopharmaceutical industry. A product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about our product’s safety and efficacy and could limit our ability to sell one or more products by preventing or interfering with commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, product liability insurance for the biopharmaceutical industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms for any product we bring to market. Further, our product liability insurance coverage may not provide coverage for or may be insufficient to reimburse us for any or all expenses or losses we may suffer. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nWe rely on third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research and clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or otherwise expected, or if we fail to adequately supervise or monitor these parties, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\n \nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical and research institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct a portion of our preclinical research, assist us in conducting our clinical trials or to conduct third party-sponsored clinical trials of our product candidates. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that our preclinical research and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, the relevant trial protocol and within the context of approvals by an institutional review board or ethics committee, and we may not always be successful in ensuring such compliance. Our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of responsibility for ensuring compliance with FDA and other regulations and standards for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of preclinical research and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical and clinical development processes may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\n \nIf we are unable to obtain licenses from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or fail to comply with our obligations under such agreements, our business could be harmed.\n \nIt may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. If we are unable to license such technology, or if we are forced to license such technology on unfavorable terms, our business could be materially harmed. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products or product candidates, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, which could enable our competitors to obtain access to the same technologies licensed to us.\n \nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market, or may be forced to cease developing, manufacturing or marketing, any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under such agreements. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of the product or product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology, or impede, delay or prohibit the further development or commercialization of one or more product candidates that rely on such agreements.\n \nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n \nWe are a non-accelerated filer under the Exchange Act and, therefore, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Therefore, our internal control over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the auditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements. In addition, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the trading price for our common stock may be negatively affected.\n \n\n   38\n\n \n\nGeneral Risk Factors Related to our Business\n \nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or information technology systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations.\n \nWe utilize information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, the confidentiality and the availability and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or mitigating their effects. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our collaborators, CROs, third-party logistics providers, distributors and other contractors and consultants will be successful in protecting our clinical and other data that is stored on their systems. While we have not experienced any previous cybersecurity incidents that have had a material adverse effect on or company, we cannot provide assurance that a future cybersecurity incident will not occur or that it would not materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we may suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action as a result of cyber-attacks or other data security breaches and may incur significant additional expense to implement further data protection measures.\n \nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\n \nDuring the 12-month period ended December 31, 2024, the closing price of our stock ranged from as high as $12.15 per share and as low as $2.88 per share. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\n \nIf we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, our existing shareholders would experience further dilution.\n \nTo the extent that we raise additional funds in the future by issuing equity securities, our shareholders would experience dilution, which may be significant and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, approximately 16.7 million shares of common stock were subject to outstanding options as of December 31, 2024 and may become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements. As of December 31, 2024, we also had approximately 6.9 million additional shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans that are not subject to outstanding options. Further, to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, such conversion would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders despite the expected reduction of such dilution as a result of the capped call transactions that we entered into in connection with the original issuances of the 2026 Notes. If the holders of outstanding options or warrants elect to exercise some or all of them, or if the shares subject to our employee benefit plans are issued and become eligible for sale in the public market, or we issue common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, our shareholders would experience dilution and the market price of our common stock could decline.\n \n   39\n\n \n\nIf we or the third parties upon whom we rely are adversely affected by natural disasters or other events, our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from such interruptions.\n \nAny unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, tsunami, extreme weather condition, power shortage, power outage, telecommunication failure, or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents could disrupt our operations. If a natural disaster or other event were to occur that prevents us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damages critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupts operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of a natural disaster or other event, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, and we could potentially lose valuable data and other items. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Washington law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, difficult and prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\n \nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Washington law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on shareholder actions by less than unanimous written consent, restrictions on the ability of shareholders to fill board vacancies and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\n \nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\n \nOur business requires significant funding. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings, if any, in the development and growth of our business. Furthermore, we are prohibited from making cash dividend payments under the terms of our secured credit facility. Therefore, we have no intention of paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, will be the sole source of potential gain for shareholders in the foreseeable future, and an investment in our common stock for dividend income should not be relied upon.",
