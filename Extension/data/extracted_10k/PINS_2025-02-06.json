      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPinterest is a visual search and discovery platform, positioned at the intersection of search, social, and commerce. We offer a unique and differentiated experience that enables people to go from inspiration to action all on one consumer internet property. Pinterest can be accessed through our mobile application or the web.\nPeople use Pinterest to find useful, relevant ideas—and then bring them to life. People don’t always have the words to describe what they’re looking for, but often know it when they see it. As they browse Pinterest content (called “Pins”), they fine-tune their tastes and find the perfect idea. Users interact with the platform in dynamic multi-session journeys to find inspiration, curate their latest look, plan their next project and shop from great brands. This happens at a massive scale, with billions of searches and saves per month.\nThe unique, first party, intent-based signal we receive from user actions on Pinterest helps power the AI based recommendation systems that we use to surface relevant and engaging content to our users. \nAI also plays a central role in how we drive value for our advertisers, who come to Pinterest to reach our users with high commercial intent. The inspiration-to-action journey on Pinterest aligns with the advertiser marketing funnel, allowing us to help brands reach customers at every stage, from discovery to purchase, through digital ads.\nWe believe users and advertisers intentionally choose Pinterest because of our efforts to create a positive and more brand safe environment. As a result, we make deliberate decisions through our policies and product development and aim to deliver on that experience, creating value for advertisers who can showcase their product and services in an inspiring and positive environment.\nOur Users and Our Platform\n553 million monthly active users from around the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas, curate and refine their tastes, and turn those ideas into reality. Our platform particularly resonates with women, who comprise roughly two-thirds of our total user base. In addition, our platform also resonates with the younger generation, as Gen Z users represent over 40% of our user base. Geographically, we have a diverse user set, representing over 100 countries globally.\nContent on Pinterest comes from a variety of sources, including retailers, brands, creators, publishers and users. We acquire that content via a wide range of methods including product catalog uploads, direct publishing, and user curation. Content formats include images that allow you to click into an idea to learn more, videos that provide the steps of an idea, collages that allow users to piece together different images into one, and products that brands and merchants upload from catalogs.\nOn Pinterest, users interact with several surfaces, each of which offers distinct functionalities and experiences. Users often move between these surfaces various times in a single session and across multiple sessions. Saving content and creating boards and collages are highly unique and beneficial to our ecosystem, as we utilize the signals from the curation to help serve users even more relevant content recommendations.\nHome Feed: When users open the Pinterest mobile application or navigate to www.pinterest.com, they are by default in their Home Feed, where they can discover Pins relevant to their tastes and interests in a scrolling format. As users interact with more content - through searching, saving and curating - their Home Feed is designed to become even more representative of their interests.\nSearch Page: On the Search surface, users find Pins they are looking for by typing a query in the search bar. The search functionality allows users to see many relevant possibilities that are personalized for their individual taste and interests. Users often come to Pinterest with a vague idea of what they’re looking for and use our visual search functionality to narrow their focus. As such, over 90% of our searches are unbranded.\nRelated Pins: Visual discovery on Pinterest also happens when a user taps on a Pin to learn more about an idea or image, and a feed of visually similar Pins is served beneath the tapped image. These related Pins help users \nPart I\n\nspringboard off a point of inspiration to explore deeper into an interest or narrow in on the perfect product. Our related pins surface is powered by our recommendation models that use computer vision designed to identify products in the Pin and show other relevant organic or ads content that the user might find valuable to their inspiration to action journey.\nBoards: Users save and organize Pins onto virtual “boards.” Boards often are labeled with topical categories like “Hawaiian vacation,” “spring outfits” or “living room furniture” and are a collection of Pins that help users organize the vast amount of visual content that they interact with on the platform.\nHow we monetize the inspiration to action journey:\nOur Flywheel\nOur users often come to the platform to get inspiration for many of life’s moments, which can lead to discovering new products and brands. As a result, commercial content from brands, retailers and advertisers is central to Pinterest. We believe that in-market consumers on Pinterest tend to be early in their journey toward a purchase decision and do not yet know exactly what they want to purchase. Accordingly, we believe that they are open to discovering new products and brands on Pinterest rather than merely navigating to brands they already know, as is common on traditional search engines and e-commerce platforms. This creates a unique flywheel where relevant ads can not only enhance the user experience but also drive more value for advertisers in the form of increased views, clicks and conversions.\nOur Advertising System\nAd Formats\nWe have a number of advertising products to help advertisers meet users across the full funnel, from upper funnel brand advertising to lower funnel performance advertising. Many of our ad formats can be leveraged by advertisers across upper and lower funnel objectives. Additionally, many of these formats are enabled with mobile deep links and/or direct link capabilities for a seamless, one-click handoff from an ad to the advertiser’s mobile app or webpage.\n•Standard ad: A static image used to showcase content in a simple vertical image format.\n•Video ad: Used by advertisers to capture attention and tell a story with a visually engaging format. \n•Shopping ad: Used by advertisers who wish to promote specific products in their catalogs to reach users who are deciding what to buy. \n•Carousel ad: Multiple static images or videos in one carousel, used by advertisers to showcase more than one image or video at a time.\n•Collection ad: Used by advertisers to display products in action with a hybrid format that mixes lifestyle imagery and video with featured products.\n•Interactive ad: Used by advertisers to engage with their users through interactive formats.\n•Premier Spotlight ad: Used by advertisers to showcase their latest product launch or seasonal moments with exclusive placements on the Pinterest Home Feed and search page.\nAd Auction\nThe vast majority of our advertisers buy ads through an auction-based system. Our ad auction allows us to serve ads to users at relevant moments while optimizing business outcomes for advertisers.\nWe offer ads across both the upper and lower funnel. Upper funnel “brand” revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “brand” objectives like impressions (\"CPM\") or video views (\"CPV\"). Lower funnel revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “performance” objectives like clicks (\"CPC\"), actions (“CPA”) or conversion events (\"oCPM\"), such as a checkout or add-to-cart.\nPart I\n\nOur auction system selects the best ad for each available ad impression, based on the likelihood of a desired action occurring and how much that action is worth to advertisers. The likelihood of the action occurring depends on a variety of factors, such as ad relevance and creative quality.\nCampaign Management\nFor most campaigns, advertisers can manage set up, track results and improve performance over time through our Ads Manager or the Pinterest API. To help maximize performance, advertisers can target specific groups of users based on interests, demographics and search keywords. We continue to invest in AI to automate campaign set up and performance optimization for our advertisers.\nMeasurement\nMeasuring the effectiveness of digital ad spend is a high priority for our advertisers. Our first-party measurement solutions, including our Conversions API and clean rooms, are designed to help advertisers recognize the value of an investment on our platform across a variety of objectives. We also have tools to help advertisers understand our contribution and drivers to conversion, and incremental impact. Advertisers can leverage our leading third-party measurement partners to validate Pinterest’s performance individually and across channels. Additionally, our Conversions API is integrated with other third-party partners to help increase adoption of our measurement tools.\nSales and Marketing\nOur go-to-market approach\nThe Pinterest platform enables a diverse group of advertisers to achieve a wide range of objectives, from building awareness to driving consideration and delivering conversions. We have advertisers across multiple verticals including retail, consumer packaged goods, travel, financial services, and auto. We serve these advertisers in customized ways depending on their size, sophistication and objectives across the full funnel. The majority of our advertisers utilize our Ads Manager platform to initiate and manage their campaigns. We also have a global sales force presence who work directly with advertisers and ad agencies to provide additional support through the campaign management cycle. In some geographies, we work with other third parties to support our sales efforts.\nMarketing\nWe grow our global user base organically through the strength of our global brand, the utility of our service and unpaid traffic from search engines. In addition, we use paid marketing to grow and retain our user base, build brand awareness and attract advertisers through business marketing and scaled education tools for optimizing campaigns on our platform.\nOur technology innovation\nWe believe we have one of the largest image-rich data sets ever assembled. Using our proprietary AI technology and computer vision, we can leverage our data sets to analyze trends, understand intent and predict consumer behavior at a massive scale to help serve personalized and relevant recommendations for users and improved ads delivery for our customers. We aim to continue innovating on our industry-leading work across AI to deepen our foothold in visual search and discovery.\nOur competition\nWe primarily compete with consumer internet companies that are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks), particularly ones focused on advertising. Competitors such as Amazon, Meta (including Facebook and Instagram), Google (including YouTube), Snap, Reddit, TikTok and X, many of which are larger and have significantly greater financial and human resources, offer users engaging content and commerce opportunities through similar technology or products to ours. We remain focused on emerging competition as well. \nWe face competition across almost every aspect of our business. We compete to attract, engage and retain users and their time and attention. We also compete with other platforms to attract, retain and grow our base of creators and publishers. \nPart I\n\nWe also compete for advertisers and advertising revenue across a variety of formats and goals, which depends on our ability to deliver compelling returns on investment. Finally, we compete for talent to attract and retain highly talented individuals, particularly people with expertise in computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning. \nIntellectual property\nOur success is tied in part to our ability to protect our intellectual property and key technological innovations. We rely on a combination of federal, state and common-law rights in the United States and rights under the laws of other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights to help protect our brand and proprietary technologies. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology and to preserve our rights thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 400 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to aspects of our actual or contemplated operations and technologies. We also had over 660 registered trademarks and trademark applications in the United States and foreign countries, including our “Pinterest” name and related logos. \nWe are also dependent on third-party content, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business.\nWe are presently involved in intellectual property litigation and expect to continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors and “non-practicing entities,” that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.\nFor additional information on risks relating to intellectual property, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”\nGovernment regulation\nWe are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content moderation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, or that significantly restrict or impose conditions on our ability to collect, store, augment, analyze, use and share data or increase consumer notice or consent requirements before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies or that increase the liability of content platforms like us. Many relevant laws and regulations are still evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our business, and new laws and regulations may be enacted, including in connection with the restriction or prohibition of certain content or business activities.\nWe rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the United States, and the Digital Services Act (“DSA” ) and EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (\"EU Copyright Directive\") in the European Union. Additional new and pending legislation in the US and around the world may impose additional obligations or risk on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform.\nWe receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPA”), the Florida Digital Bill of Rights, and other state laws that may take effect in 2025. These laws expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, collected, used and shared, creates new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal data, increases requirements for security and confidentiality and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending concerning content moderation, transparency, and access, as well as data \nPart I\n\nprotection that could affect us. These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.\nGovernment authorities outside the United States may also seek to restrict access to or block our service, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our service or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our service in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. For example, access to our service has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in certain countries. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content.\nFor additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”\nSeasonality \nWe have historically experienced seasonality in monthly active user growth, monetization on our platform and free cash flow. Historically, we have had lower sequential user growth in the second calendar quarter. Industry advertising spend tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter resulting in higher revenue, and free cash flow is historically higher in the first quarter as we collect on the fourth quarter's higher revenue. We expect this seasonality to continue.\nTalent management and development\nIn order to fulfill our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, we strive to attract and retain top talent. To attract and retain great talent, we strive to create opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. As of December 31, 2024, we had 4,666 full-time employees. \nInclusion and belonging\nWe strive to create an inclusive workplace where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work every day. We seek for and respect a wide range of experiences and perspectives across our Board of Directors, leadership and employee base, which we believe helps us create a more inclusive and global product.\nEmployee health, safety and benefits\nThe success of our business is fundamentally tied to the well-being of our people. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health. We also have a flexible work model that provides employees in roles that can be performed from anywhere the autonomy to live and work flexibly within their country or region, while prioritizing intentional in-person collaboration at our offices. \nWe provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and their families. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include equity awards, sales incentive programs for eligible employees, a 401(k) Plan with Company matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, family leave and family care support, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs and charitable donation matching, among many others. We regularly review and update our compensation and benefits programs as needed to remain competitive with market compensation. For example, in 2022, we enhanced our family leave benefits for birthing and adoptive parents. Because every family is unique, we offer additional benefits to parents and caregivers with newborns in neonatal intensive care, adoptive parents and people experiencing miscarriage, and also offer fertility benefits globally. To promote financial wellbeing, we offer money management education, financial planning and investment services. To promote emotional wellbeing, we offer free access to mental health and wellbeing tools like Lyra, Calm and Cleo.\n Learning and development\nWe help our employees create a career that is inspiring, impactful and ultimately time well spent. We have programs for open and ongoing conversation towards career growth goals both long term and short term. We also have workshops \nPart I\n\ndedicated to learning new skills and developing an employee’s career. We set aside a dedicated personal learning and development budget for every employee.\nCorporate information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, and our telephone number is (415) 762-7100.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision with respect to our Class A common stock. Some of the factors, events, and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. The occurrence of any of the following risks and uncertainties could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations, growth, prospects, reputation, revenue, financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties; our business could also be affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. \nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy and Growth\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers or a reduction in how much they spend could harm our business, revenue and financial results. \nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from third-party advertising. However, we may not be able to continue to grow and scale this revenue model. Our growth strategy depends on, among other things, attracting more advertisers (including expanding our sales efforts to reach advertisers in international markets), retaining and scaling our business with existing advertisers and expanding our advertising product offerings.\nAs is common in our industry, most of our advertisers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our advertisers spend a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. To increase the number of advertisers and increase the portion of the advertising budget that our existing advertisers spend with us, we must invest in new tools and technology and/or expand our sales force, and there can be no assurance that those efforts will be successful. The insights on user behavior we provide to advertisers may not yield effective results for the advertisers and may reduce or stop their spend on our platform. In addition, unless we improve existing and develop new measurement tools that better showcase our platform’s effectiveness, some advertisers may view our products or platform as experimental and may devote less advertising spend on our platform. In addition, many advertisers do not have advertising creative content in a format that would be successful on our platform and may be unable or unwilling to devote the technical or financial resources required to develop content for our platform. Further, we may not always be able to develop tools that effectively and efficiently meet the needs of advertisers. Advertisers will not do business with us if they do not believe that advertisements on our platform are effective in meeting their campaign goals, if we cannot measure the effectiveness of our advertising products or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of advertisers and is currently concentrated in certain verticals, particularly CPG and retail. We either contract directly with advertisers or with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers, many of which are owned by large media corporations that exercise varying degrees of control over the agencies. Our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed by the loss of, or a deterioration in our relationship with, any of our largest advertisers or with any advertising agencies or the large media corporations that control them.\nIn addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from partnerships with third-party advertising platforms. We may be unable to maintain these partnerships or identify and secure new partnerships on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, we may be exposed to reputational and other risks arising from our business association with these partners. \nOur advertising revenue could be harmed by many other factors, including: \n•decreases in the number of our MAUs or our MAU growth rate;\n•decreases in our users’ engagement with us and the ads on our platform;\n•changes in the price of advertisements; \nPart I\n\n•our inability to create new products that sustain or increase the value of our advertisements; \n•our inability to meet advertiser demand on our platform if we cannot increase the size and engagement of our user base;\n• if our partnerships for third-party advertisement demand do not yield expected business impact;\n•our inability to find the right balance between brand and performance advertising and provide the right products and platform to support the pricing and demand needed for each of the advertisers and their advertising objectives;\n•changes in user demographics that make us less attractive to advertisers; \n•our inability to make our ads more relevant and effective; \n•any decision to serve contextually relevant or less personalized advertisements; \n•the availability, accuracy and utility of our analytics and measurement solutions that demonstrate the value of our advertisements, or our ability to further improve such tools; \n•changes to our data privacy practices (including those relating to protecting the security and integrity of our platform, our use of artificial intelligence, as well those resulting from changes to laws, regulations, legal decisions, or third-party policies) that affect the type or manner of advertising that we are able to provide;\n•our inability to collect, process and share data which new or existing advertisers find useful; \n•competitive developments or advertiser perception of the value of our products; \n•product changes or advertising inventory management decisions we make that change the type, size or frequency of advertisements on our platform; \n•reductions of advertising due to users that upload content or take other actions that are deemed to be hostile, inappropriate, illicit, objectionable, illegal or otherwise not consistent with our advertisers’ brands; \n•the impact of invalid clicks or click fraud on our advertisements; \n•the failure of our advertising auction mechanism to target and price ads effectively; \n•decreases in user response rate to application notifications received from Pinterest, whether due to decreased user appreciation for notifications generally or changes in the manner notifications are delivered by mobile operating systems, which may decrease user engagement;\n•difficulty and frustration from advertisers who may need to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines or experience challenges uploading and conforming their advertisements with our system requirements; \n•the macroeconomic conditions and the status of the advertising industry, such as fear of recession, inflation, the impact of tariffs, supply chain issues and inventory and labor shortages, which could cause businesses to spend less on advertising and/or direct their advertising spend to larger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products; \n•restrictions placed on, or the relevance of, ads outside of the United States;\n•adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to us or to social media platforms in general (including those relating to data security and protection), may tarnish our reputation and erode advertisers’ confidence in our platform;\n•laws that allow users to opt out of the use of personal data or restrict the use of personal data of teens, which may limit or prohibit us and our customers from targeting advertising to users, including teens; and\n•the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese and other factors could reduce the amount that advertisers spend on our platform, or cause advertisers to stop advertising with us altogether.\nOur ecosystem of users and advertisers depends on our ability to attract, retain and engage our user base. If we fail to add new users or retain or recover users, or if users engage less with us, our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed. \nIf current and potential users do not perceive their experience with our platform to be useful, or the content that we serve to them to be relevant to their personal taste and interests, we may not be able to attract new users, retain existing users, recover past users or maintain or increase the frequency and duration of users' engagement. User engagement fluctuates depending on factors beyond our control. For example, although we saw a higher number of users and higher user engagement during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we experienced declines in the number of users and lower levels of user engagement as the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\nPart I\n\nWe anticipate that our active user growth rate will decline over time if the size of our active user base increases or we achieve higher market penetration rates. As a result, our financial performance will increasingly depend on our ability to increase user engagement and our monetization efforts. Our platform particularly resonates with women, who comprise a significant majority of our total user base. In addition, our platform also resonates with the younger generation, as Gen Z users represent a large portion of our user base. We may not be able to further increase the number of users in these demographics and may need to increase the number of users in other demographics, such as men and international users, in order to grow our users. Further, we may make changes to our product that makes it less attractive for a particular demographic.\nThere are many other factors that could negatively affect user growth, retention and engagement, including if: \n•our competitors mimic our products or product features or create more engaging platforms or products, causing users to utilize their products instead of, or more frequently than, our products;\n•we do not provide a compelling user experience because of the decisions we make regarding our products or the type and frequency of advertisements that we display;\n•our content is not relevant to users’ personal taste and interests;\n•search queries by users do not yield relevant results; \n•third parties do not permit or continue to permit their content to be displayed on our platform;\n•users have difficulty or are blocked from installing, updating or otherwise accessing our platform on mobile devices or web browsers;\n•there are changes in the amount of time users spend across all applications and platforms, including ours;\n•users use or spend more time on other platforms that they feel are more relevant or engaging in lieu of our platform;\n•we are unable to attract creators or publishers to create engaging and relevant content on our platform; \n•there is decreased engagement with our products, decreased efficiency of our advertising products, or failure to accept our terms of service as part of changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether required or voluntarily, in connection with, for example, the GDPR, the DSA, the CCPA, and other U.S. federal and state privacy, and youth and social media laws, among others;\n•technical or other problems frustrate the user experience, particularly if those problems prevent us from delivering our service in a fast and reliable manner;\n•we are unable to successfully educate users how to utilize new products and product features that we introduce, such as live stream content, video and shopping features;\n•users are located in countries with low smartphone penetration or with lack of cellular based data network since our products typically require high bandwidth data capabilities; \n•changes in regulations or our contractual arrangements that adversely impact our access to, and use of, zero-rating offers or other discounts or data usage for our platform;\n•we are unable to address user and advertiser concerns regarding the content, privacy and security of our platform;\n•we are unable to combat spam, harassment, cyberbullying, discriminatory, political or other harmful, hostile, inappropriate, misleading, abusive, offensive, or illegal content or usage on our products or services;\n•users adopt new technologies that block our products or services or where our products or services may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;\n•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our platform, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are discontinued;\n•merchants on Pinterest do not provide users with positive shopping experiences, for example, if products are not of the quality depicted on the platform or not readily available for purchase;\n•there are macro level conditions that are beyond our control; or\n•the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur.\nOur ability to serve advertisements on our platform, and therefore the value proposition for our advertisers, depends on the size and engagement of our user base. Our growth efforts are not currently focused on increasing the number of daily active users, and we do not anticipate that most of our users will become daily active users. Therefore, even if we are able to increase demand for our advertising products, we may not be able to deliver those advertisements if we cannot also increase the size and engagement of our user base, which could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nAny decrease in user growth, retention or engagement could render our platform less attractive to users or advertisers.\nPart I\n\nIf we are not able to continue to provide content that is useful and relevant to users’ personal taste and interests or fail to take appropriate action on objectionable content or block objectionable practices by advertisers or third parties, user growth, retention or engagement could decline, which could result in the loss of advertisers and revenue.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide users with content, including advertisements and shopping content, that is useful and relevant to their personal taste and interests, which in turn, depends on the content contributed by our users, creators, publishers, advertisers, merchants and other third-party partners and the manner in which we present that content to users. We may not be able to effectively compete for content on our platform, may not be able to effectively partner with third-party content publishers or may get content that is not relevant, useful or inspiring to our users. \nThe size of our user base and their level of engagement are critical to our success. If our platform is not perceived to be high-quality, relevant, reliable, trustworthy, or innovative, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement.\nUsers engage with content that is relevant to their country, language and gender preferences as well as their personal interests and intent. We may not always correctly or timely identify and serve content that is useful and relevant to users. In addition, new content and new or different forms of content we distribute may not have as much relevancy signal for optimal distribution of the Pins as prior content and forms of content that have been saved repeatedly on our platform, which may result in lower user engagement with such content. Content that is not visually pleasing, is not intuitive or easy to use or is not in the desired language may not be engaging for users, especially in non-U.S. markets. If users do not believe that we offer content that is useful and relevant to their personal taste and interests, user growth, retention or engagement may decline, which could result in the loss of advertisers and revenue.\nSome of the actions that we may take to make our platform more positive and inspiring and make our content more useful and relevant may reduce traffic that we drive from our platform to the websites of third parties, which may reduce their willingness to contribute or continue availability of their content on our platform. We endeavor to keep divisive, disturbing or unsafe content off our platform by deactivating or limiting the distribution of certain types of content, even if this content would be permitted on other platforms, which could result in a decrease in user growth, retention or engagement. We apply significant judgment in making these determinations and may be unsuccessful in our efforts to remove this content in a manner that is (or is perceived to be) consistently applied and on a timely basis or at all, which could also result in a decrease in user growth, retention or engagement. Further, we may not be able to prevent users from misusing the content they discover on our platform, or misusing the platform itself, which may harm our brand and reputation and also deter users and advertisers from using our platform. If we fail to identify and keep off our platform advertisers and merchants who offer poor quality goods or fail to deliver goods to their customers, we may lose user confidence. In addition, controversies regarding content on other social media platforms, such as the allegations of the impact of social media on the mental health of users, may impact user engagement and advertising spending on our platform. Any of these factors could decrease our user growth, retention or engagement.\nWe regularly monitor how our advertising affects users’ experiences in our effort to avoid delivering too many advertisements or irrelevant advertisements to users, and will, from time to time, change the number of advertisements or eliminate certain types of advertisements to maintain users’ satisfaction in the service. Further, advertisements may be placed near content that may not be relevant or inspiring which can deter advertisers from using our platform.\nFrom time to time, we make changes to our platform based on feedback provided by users or advertisers. These decisions may not produce the short-term or long-term benefits that we expect, in which case user growth, retention and engagement, our relationships with advertisers, and our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed. \nIf we are unable to collect, process and use data because of data privacy laws, regulations, and legal decisions, it could impact our ability to effectively deliver relevant content. These laws, regulations, and legal decisions may also impact our ability to expand advertising on our platform, as they may impede our ability to sell or deliver targeted advertising and accurately measure our ad performance. Additionally, even if not prohibited by data privacy laws, regulations, and legal decisions, we may elect not to collect certain types of data if we believe doing so would be inconsistent with our users’ expectations, if the source is unreliable or for any other reason. These and other decisions we make related to data privacy, including with respect to the advertising performance measurement tools that we have developed and may develop in the future, may fall short of our users’ expectations, and even if we satisfy their expectations, the increase in media attention generally about online privacy and data protection may motivate users to take certain actions to protect their privacy. For these and other reasons, our users may elect not to allow data sharing or use. This could impact our ability to deliver relevant content aligned with users’ personal taste and interests. Additionally, the impact of these developments may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to certain peers in the technology sector that, by virtue of the scope and breadth of their operations or user base, have greater access to user data.\nPart I\n\nSince substantially all our revenue is generated from advertising, our inability to serve the volume of advertisements desired by our advertisers may deter new or existing advertisers from using our platform.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively for users.\nWe face significant competition to attract, retain and engage users and for their time and attention. We compete with consumer internet companies that are either tools (search, e-commerce, creator tools) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks).\nWe compete with large, established companies and companies that offer widely used products, such as Amazon, Meta (including Instagram), Google (including YouTube), Snap, Reddit, TikTok and X, which provide their users with a variety of online products, services, content (including video), and other offerings, and advertising offerings, including web search engines, social networks and other means of discovering, using or acquiring goods and services. Several of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, research, marketing and other resources and larger user bases than we do. Several of these competitors also have access to larger volumes of data and platforms that are used on a more frequent basis than ours, which may enable them to better understand their user base and develop and deliver more relevant content.\nOur competitors have previously and may continue to develop technology, products, services or interfaces that are similar to our existing and future products quickly and at scale, or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products, including by users, advertisers, creators, publishers and other third parties. We may face additional competition with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants. Some of our competitors also operate existing products that have significant market power in certain market sectors and could use that market power to advance their own products or services that compete with ours. For example, many of our competitors have introduced shopping platforms, expanded their video-based and live shopping experiences. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts and undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, which may allow them to build larger, more engaged user bases than ours. Also, some of our existing or potential competitors operate products or services from which we currently derive substantial value, such as search engines and email, and those competitors could reduce or eliminate the value and information we receive. \nWe also face competition from smaller companies in one or more high-value verticals that offer users engaging content and commerce opportunities through similar technology, products, features or services to ours. In addition, emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide technology, products, services or features similar to ours or before us.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in user preferences. Barriers to entry in our industry are low, and our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent competitors from launching comparable products or services.\nIn emerging international markets, where mobile devices often lack large storage capabilities, we may also compete with other applications for the limited space available on a user’s mobile device.\nIn addition to the above, we believe that our ability to compete for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: \n•the usefulness, novelty, performance and reliability of our platform compared to those of our competitors; \n•the timing and market acceptance of products, including the developments and enhancements to those products, offered by us or our competitors; \n•our brand strength relative to our competitors; and \n•the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe may be unable to compete effectively for advertisers.\nWe face significant competition for advertising revenue across a variety of formats. To compete effectively, we must enable our advertisers to easily create content and buy, forecast, optimize and measure the performance of advertising on our platform. In order to grow our revenue and improve our operating results, we must increase our share of advertising spend relative to our competitors, many of which are larger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products, as well as more robust tools to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.\nSome of our larger competitors have substantially broader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain additional share of advertising spend. They have large distributed sales forces and an increasing amount of control over mobile distribution channels. These competitors’ economies of scale allow them to have access to larger volumes of data and platforms that are used on a more frequent basis than ours, which may enable them to better understand their user base and develop and deliver more targeted advertising. They may not need to rely on third-party data, including data provided by advertisers, in order to effectively target the campaigns of advertisers, \nPart I\n\nwhich could make their advertising products more attractive to advertisers than ours as third-party data becomes less available to us, whether because of regulatory changes, privacy concerns or other reasons. If we are unable to provide our advertisers with the ability to effectively target their advertising campaigns, or if our advertisers do not believe that our value proposition is as compelling as those of our competitors, we may not be able to attract new advertisers or retain existing ones.\nWe believe that our ability to compete for advertisers depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n•sales, marketing, customer service and support efforts;\n•first- and third-party data available to us relative to our competitors;\n•ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors;\n•the attractiveness and volume of our product and service offerings (including pricing and measurement tools) compared to those of our competitors;\n•the strength of our advertiser relationships and offerings compared to those of our competitors;\n•the ease with which our advertising products fit into existing advertiser budgets compared to those of our competitors;\n•positions or actions taken by us, users, advertisers or other third parties that may impact our brand and reputation or the desirability of advertising on online platforms in general; and\n•the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe may not be able to develop effective products and tools for advertisers. \nGrowth in our advertising revenue depends on our ability to continue to develop and offer effective products and tools for advertisers. New ad formats that take up more space on our platform may result in fewer impressions, which could adversely affect our revenue. As the advertising market generates and develops new concepts and technologies, we may incur additional costs to implement more effective products and tools. We may introduce changes to our existing ad products or develop and introduce new and unproven ad products with which we have little or no prior experience. For example, as we execute on our business strategy of transitioning to provide full funnel advertising solutions there is no guarantee that the lower funnel performance advertising solutions that we have developed and that we may develop in the future will be attractive to or effective for advertisers or that we will otherwise be successful in executing on this strategy. Each of these could result in unintended outcomes or results that are not well received by advertisers. In addition, if new or enhanced ad products fail to attract or retain advertisers, we may fail to generate sufficient revenue. Further, continuing to develop and improve these products and tools may require significant time and resources and additional investment. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising products and tools in a timely fashion, or if our advertising products and tools are not well received by advertisers, our advertising revenue could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not develop successful new products or improve existing ones, our business may suffer. We may also invest in new products that fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue.\nOur ability to grow, retain and engage our user base and therefore increase our revenue depends on our ability to successfully enhance our existing products and create new products, both independently and in conjunction with platform developers or other third parties, and to do so quickly. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. Our focus on innovation and experimentation could result in unintended outcomes or decisions that are poorly received by users. If new or enhanced products fail to engage our users, we may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments. We also may develop new products that may increase user engagement and costs that may not increase revenue or that may not be fully integrated into the user experience.\nFurther, our products often require users to learn new behaviors that may not always be intuitive to them. To the extent that new users are less willing to invest the time to learn to use our products, or if we are unable to make our products easier to learn to use, our user growth, retention or engagement could be negatively affected.\nWe continue to develop our international growth strategy and may not succeed in further expanding and monetizing our platform internationally and may be subject to increased international business and economic risks. \nWe continue to develop and evolve our international growth strategy and may adjust the way we expand our business operations outside the United States. We may limit our expansion or decrease our operations in certain international markets, including discontinuing advertising in those markets or not monetizing those markets at all. Alternatively, we may enter new international markets and expand in existing markets where we have limited or no experience in deploying our service or selling advertisements. We may launch our advertising platform in countries where we do not have sales staffing \nPart I\n\nin place, where market perception of our service and ad platform may be low or where our audience size in a given market may be low relative to advertiser expectations, all or any of which could limit our ability to monetize those countries. In addition, as part of our growth and monetization strategy in markets outside the United States, we are working to partner with local third-party sales organizations, which we refer to as resellers. However, there is no guarantee that resellers will choose to work with us or be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to effectively sell our platform or that this strategy will be successful to increase average revenue per user in these markets. Further, in order to expand successfully, we need to offer content and products that are customized and relevant to local users and advertisers, which requires significant investment of time and resources. \nWe are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, and our exposure to these risks will increase as we continue to expand our operations, user base and advertiser base globally. These risks include:\n•political, social and economic instability, including armed conflict or hostilities, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war in the Middle East;\n•selective or inconsistent government regulatory action or enforcement; \n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and restrictions on currency conversions; \n•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud; \n•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions; \n•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; \n•difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and tax compliance costs associated with multiple international locations and subsidiaries; \n•different regulations and practices with respect to employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain international jurisdictions; \n•increasing labor costs due to high wage inflation in certain international jurisdictions; \n•compliance with statutory requirements relating to our equity; \n•regulations that might add difficulties in repatriating cash earned outside the United States and otherwise prevent us from freely moving cash; \n•import and export controls and restrictions and changes in trade regulations, including sanctions or increased or new tariffs; \n•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions; \n•compliance with laws governing supply chains and related business operations;\n•compliance with environmental, social and governance (ESG) laws and with GDPR and similar data privacy and data protection laws; \n•compliance with laws that might restrict content or advertising (such as laws intended to protect teens), require us to provide user information, including confidential information, to local authorities or add significant requirements that make it difficult to operate in that jurisdiction;\n•macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation and labor shortage which had an impact on the pace of our global expansion;\n•compliance with multiple tax jurisdictions and management of tax impact of global operations; and \n•the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nIf we are unable to execute our strategy on international growth and manage the complexity of global operations successfully, our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the growth of our business. \nAlthough we experienced rapid growth in our initial years, we have not seen the same level of rapid growth more recently and cannot assure you that our business will grow at those same rates or at all. \nThe growth and expansion of our business and product offerings and the increase in full-time employees place significant challenges on our management, operational and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, creators, publishers, advertisers, technology licensors and other third parties. If we continue to grow our operations or the number of our third-party relationships, our technology systems, procedures or internal controls may not be adequate. Advancements in technology such as AI and machine learning are changing the way people work by automating tasks, enhancing communication, and improving decision-making processes, and our business may be harmed or we may face \nPart I\n\ncompetitive disadvantage if we are slow to adopt these new technologies. Further, we may not be able to continue to develop or maintain a long-term growth strategy, execute the strategy effectively, or effectively manage the growth of our business. For example, during times of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we make decisions from time to time to save costs in certain ways that could adversely affect our business, operations, revenue and financial results.\nWe utilize a flexible work model and, as a result, a majority of our employees work remotely. Accordingly, we are required to implement more complex organizational management strategies. We may also find it increasingly difficult to preserve our workplace culture as we grow, particularly given our flexible work model, which could impact our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products and adequately oversee employees and business functions. \nWe make decisions consistent with our mission and values that may reduce our short- or medium-term operating results.\nOur mission—to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love—and company values are integral to everything we do. We frequently make decisions regarding our business and platform in accordance with our mission and values that may reduce our short- or medium-term operating results if we believe those decisions will improve the experiences of users, advertisers, content creators, employees or our community, and therefore benefit our business. For example, we may choose to remove content that we have determined does not create an inspiring and positive experience for users or revise our policies in ways that decrease user engagement. These decisions may not be consistent with the expectations of investors and any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the time frame we expect or at all.\nWe may acquire other businesses, talent or technology, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. \nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products or technologies. Our previous and future acquisitions may not achieve our goals, and we may not realize benefits from acquisitions we make in the future. Any acquisitions, including the integration process will require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, or the personnel or technologies associated with those acquisitions, the business, revenue and financial results of the combined company could be harmed. Our acquisition strategy may change over time and future acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, advertisers, investors or other parties with whom we do business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition, including accounting charges. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities that we assume as a result of acquiring companies. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our securities. We would expect to finance any future acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing or cash from operations. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and reputation, and if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our ability to expand our user and advertiser base could be impaired. \nWe believe that our brand, identity and reputation have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the “Pinterest” brand and reputation is critical to retaining and growing our user, creator, publisher and advertiser base. Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation depends largely on our continued ability to provide high-quality, relevant, reliable, trustworthy and innovative products, which may require substantial investment and may not be successful. From time to time, we introduce new products or updates to existing products that require users to agree to new terms of service that users may not like, which may negatively affect our brand and reputation. Additionally, advertisements or actions of our advertisers may affect our brand and reputation if users do not think the advertisements help them accomplish their objectives, or view the advertisements as intrusive, annoying or misleading or have poor experiences with our advertisers. In addition, our brand, identity and reputation may be adversely affected by perceptions of social media platforms in general, including perceptions resulting from factors unrelated to the company’s actions or the content or actions of users, such as the boycott of Facebook and X by some advertisers or allegations of the impact of social media on the mental health of users.\nOur brand and reputation can also be negatively affected by the content or actions of our users that are deemed to be harmful or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of our users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading, or by the use of our platform for illicit, illegal or objectionable ends. We also may fail to respond expeditiously to the sharing of illegal, illicit or objectionable content on our platform or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise address user or advertiser concerns, \nPart I\n\nwhich could erode confidence in our brand and damage our reputation. We expect that our ability to enforce our policies against this content in a consistently applied manner and on a timely basis or at all may decrease as the number of users grows, as the amount of content on the platform increases or as we expand our product and service offerings, such as video and live streaming content. Any governmental or regulatory inquiry, investigation or action, including based on the appearance of illegal, illicit or objectionable content on our platform, our business practices, or failure to comply with laws and regulations, could damage our brand and reputation, regardless of the outcome.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, media, legislative, governmental, regulatory, investor and other third-party scrutiny of our decisions. Any scrutiny, inquiry, investigation or action, including regarding our data privacy, copyright, content, employment or other practices, workplace culture, charitable giving, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory action or regarding the actions of our employees, users or advertisers or other issues, may harm our brand and reputation. In addition, scrutiny of other companies in our industry, including their impact on user “screen time” or their content policies or data privacy practices, could also have a negative impact on our brand and reputation. These concerns, whether actual or unfounded, may also deter users, creators, publishers or advertisers from using our platform. \nAdverse publicity, regardless of its accuracy, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, third-party vendors, users, creators, publishers or our advertisers, or to social media platforms in general, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. If we fail to promote and maintain the “Pinterest” brand or preserve our reputation, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed. In addition, parental or general public perception of our industry or our Company in particular could adversely affect the size, demographics, engagement, and loyalty of our user base.\nContinued development and use of AI may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations.\nWe use machine learning and AI technologies in our products and services, and we are making investments in expanding our AI capabilities, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new product features using AI technologies. There are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our profitability. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant potential disruption from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. The continued integration of any AI technologies into our products can result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, intellectual property claims, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, negative user perceptions as to automation and AI, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. As a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and data protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI. For example, the Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”) recently came into effect in August 2024 and gives companies one to three years to comply with its various requirements which are principally focused on creating transparency with respect to generative AI systems and AI-generated content. Penalties for non-compliance with the EU AI Act include fines as high as 7% of a company’s global annual revenue. We may not always be able to anticipate the necessary response to these frameworks given they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adjust our product or service offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks governing the use of AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\nOther companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models.\nUncertainty around new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of data with AI technologies, which may be costly and could impact our expenses as we expand the use of AI into our product or service offerings. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that is factually inaccurate or flawed, or otherwise unlawful, harmful or policy-violating. Such content may expose us to brand or reputational harm and/or legal liability. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, copyright and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. For example, we use generative AI which, despite our best efforts, may generate content that is not relevant or useful to our users and can subject us to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, discrimination, toxicity, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. The use of certain AI technologies presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on users or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. As such, it is not possible to predict all of the risks related to \nPart I\n\nthe use of AI, and developments in regulatory frameworks governing the use of AI and in related stakeholder expectations may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to liability.\nRisks Related to Data, Security and Privacy\nIf our security is compromised, or users or advertisers believe our security has been compromised, we could lose the trust of users, creators, publishers and advertisers who may use our platform less or may stop using our platform altogether, our reputation and business could be harmed. \nAs a social media company, we are frequently targeted by cybersecurity attacks because we receive, process, use, store, and share digitally large amounts of data, including user data as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and personal information in the ordinary course of our business. There can be no assurance that any cybersecurity attack or incident will not be material or ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. Our efforts to protect our internal data or the information that users, creators, publishers and advertisers and other partners have shared with us may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities or other technical malfunctions, cybersecurity attacks, employee error or malfeasance, hacking, ransomware, viruses or other factors. In addition, third parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to induce our personnel, users, creators, publishers, advertisers or vendors to disclose information to gain access to our data, advertisers' data or users’ data. Further, because the login credentials or passwords employed by users to access our platform may be similar to or the same as the ones that they use in connection with other platforms or websites, a breach in the security of those platforms or websites can allow third parties to gain unauthorized access to users’ accounts on our platform. If any of the events described above occur, our information or personnel's, users', creators', publishers' or advertisers' information could be accessed or disclosed improperly. If a third-party gains unauthorized access to our platform, they may, among other things, post malicious spam and other content on our platform using a user’s, creator's, publishers' or advertiser’s account, which could negatively affect our platform, reputation, and business.\nSome third parties, including advertisers and vendors, store information that we share with them on their networks. If these third parties fail to implement adequate data-security practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies, users’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. Even if these third parties take all the necessary precautions, their networks may still suffer a breach, which could compromise the data we share with them.\nAny incidents where personnel's, users’, creators', publishers', advertisers' or our information is accessed without authorization or is improperly used, or incidents that violate our privacy policy, terms of service or other policies, or the perception that an incident has occurred, could damage our brand and reputation, adversely impact our competitive position and result in significant costs. We may be required or choose to notify government authorities or affected personnel or users regarding security incidents, and government authorities or affected personnel, users, creators, publishers or advertisers could initiate legal or regulatory action against us over those incidents, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices.\nIt may be difficult and costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a cybersecurity incident and our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business. Threat actors may also gain access to other networks and systems after a compromise of our networks and systems. Further, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate for related losses resulting from a cybersecurity incident.\nIn addition, we may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to adopt additional measures designed to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations require us to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our systems and sensitive information. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective.\nMaintaining the trust of users, creators, publishers and advertisers is important to sustain user and advertiser growth, retention and engagement, and we may incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents. Concerns over our information security or data privacy practices, whether actual or unfounded, can subject us to negative publicity and damage our brand and reputation and deter users, creators, publishers and advertisers from using our platform.\nPart I\n\nOur ability to attract and retain advertisers depends on our ability to collect, process and use data and develop tools to enable us to effectively deliver and accurately measure advertisements on our platform. \nMost advertisers rely on tools that measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns in order to allocate their advertising spend among various formats and platforms. If we are unable to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform or we are unable to convince advertisers that our platform should be part of a larger advertising budget, our ability to increase the demand and pricing of our advertising products and maintain or scale our revenue may be limited. Our tools may be less developed than those of other platforms with which we compete for advertising spend. Therefore, our ability to develop and offer tools that accurately measure the effectiveness of a campaign on our platform is critical to our ability to attract new advertisers and retain, and increase spend from, our existing advertisers. \nWe are continuing to develop and improve these tools and such efforts have and are likely to continue to require significant time and resources and additional investment, and in some cases we have relied on and may in the future rely on third parties to provide data and technology needed to provide certain measurement data to our advertisers. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising tools in a timely fashion, those tools are not reliable, or the measurement results are inconsistent with advertiser goals, our advertising revenue could be adversely affected. \nMany existing advertiser tools that measure the effectiveness of advertising do not account for the role of advertising early in a user's decision-making process, which is when many users come to our platform. Instead, these tools measure the last ad or content that was exposed to the user that gets credit for influencing any user’s purchase or action. As a result, we may not be able to demonstrate and measure for our advertisers the value of engaging with a user during the early intent phase. \nIn addition, web and mobile browser developers, such as Apple, Microsoft or Google, have implemented and may continue to implement changes, including requiring additional user permissions, in their browser or device operating system that impair our ability to measure and improve the effectiveness of advertising on our platform. Such changes include, limiting the use of cookies and related tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising identifiers, and other changes that limit our ability to collect or use information that allows us to attribute user actions on advertisers’ websites to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns run on our platform. For example, Apple launched its Intelligent Tracking Prevention (“ITP”) feature in its Safari browser. ITP blocks some or all third-party cookies by default on mobile and desktop and ITP has become increasingly restrictive over time. Apple's related Privacy-Preserving Ad Click attribution (\"PPAC\"), intended to preserve some of the functionality lost with ITP, would limit cross-site and cross-device attribution, prevent measurement outside a narrowly-defined attribution window, and prevent ad re-targeting and optimization. Further, Apple implemented certain changes, including introducing an AppTrackingTransparency framework that limits the ability of mobile applications to request an iOS device’s advertising identifier and affects our ability to track user actions off our platform and connect their interactions with on-platform advertising.\nIn addition, third parties, such as Apple, Microsoft or Google, have implemented and may continue to implement changes and restrictions in browser or device functionality including by limiting the use of cookies, or that limit our ability to communicate with or understand the identity of our users.\nAll these restrictions described above make it more difficult for us to provide the most relevant ads to our users, measure the effectiveness of, and to re-target and optimize, advertising on our platform. We have developed the Pinterest Conversions API and other measurement tools to address these restrictions, which are all designed to mitigate loss of conversion signal. However, there is no guarantee that advertisers will use this technology or future technologies that we develop, or that these technologies will otherwise be effective to improve conversion visibility and enable the use of conversion data for retargeting in future advertising campaigns. Advertisers may also prioritize integrations with larger platforms due to larger spend concentration. All of this may result in advertisers spending less or not at all, on our platform and prefer larger platforms like Facebook and Google that have more capabilities to help advertisers measure their conversions. \nDevelopers may release additional technology that further inhibits our ability to collect or use data that allows us to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform. Any other restriction, whether by law, regulation, policy (including third-party policies) or otherwise, on our ability to collect, process and share data that our advertisers find useful, our ability to use or benefit from tracking and measurement technologies, including cookies, or that further reduces our ability to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform would impede our ability to attract, grow and retain advertisers. Advertisers and other third parties who provide data that helps us deliver personalized, relevant advertising may restrict or stop sharing this data. If they stop sharing this data with us, it may not be possible for us to collect this data within the product or from another source. \nWe rely heavily on our ability to collect, process and share data and metrics for our advertisers to help new and existing advertisers understand the performance of advertising campaigns. If advertisers do not perceive our metrics to be \nPart I\n\naccurate representations of our user base and user engagement, or if we discover inaccuracies in our metrics, they may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our platform.\nWe receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information, which subjects us to complex and evolving governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and other matters, which are subject to change and uncertain interpretation.\nWe receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. There are numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding matters central to our business, data privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees and business partners, the scope of which are regularly changing, subject to uncertain and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries or states or conflict with other rules.\nThe application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and as the focus on data privacy and data protection increases globally, we are, and will continue to be, subject to varied and evolving data privacy and data protection laws. We are subject to GDPR which expands the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, includes restrictions on the use of personal data of children, creates new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal data (particularly in the case of a data breach), increases requirements for security and confidentiality, restricts transfers of data outside of the European Economic Area and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance, including fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements. Additionally, we have historically relied upon multiple legally valid transfer mechanisms to transfer certain personal data outside of the European Economic Area, including the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld the validity of the SCCs subject to future elaboration of additional safeguards by regulators such as specific “supplemental measures” that should be undertaken to protect EU data subjects. While the EU Commission has approved a new EU-U.S Data Privacy Framework, which Pinterest has applied to join, the validity of data transfer mechanisms and additional safeguards remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political review and developments in both Europe and the U.S. The invalidation of data transfer mechanisms, or the potential invalidation of additional safeguards could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer the personal data of EEA users outside of the European Economic Area. The State of California enacted the CCPA which requires companies that process information of California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Other states have also enacted privacy laws similar to the CCPA, which became operative recently or will become operative in the next few years, with these providing consumers with similar abilities to opt-out of certain data sharing and to limit the use of certain data for targeted advertising. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply and may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers that have greater resources. These laws and regulations may also impact our ability to expand advertising on our platform internationally, as they may impede our ability to deliver targeted advertising and accurately measure our ad performance.\nIn addition, the privacy of teens’ personal data collected online, and use of commercial websites, applications, online services, or other interactive platforms, generally, are also becoming increasingly scrutinized. Regulations focused on online safety and protection of teens’ privacy online may require us to change our services and incur costs to do so. Moreover, various laws to restrict or govern the use of commercial websites, applications, online services, or other interactive platforms by teens have passed or have been proposed, including laws prohibiting showing teens advertising, requiring age verification or assurance, limiting the use of teens’ personal data, and requiring parental consent or providing for other parental rights. These laws may be, or in some cases already have been, subject to legal challenges and changing interpretations, which may further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. These new laws may result in restrictions on the use of certain of our products or services by teens, the inability to offer certain products and services to teens, decrease DAUs or user engagement in those jurisdictions, require changes to our products and services to achieve compliance, decrease our advertising and subscription revenue, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and our third-party partners.\nPrivacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we are legally or contractually obligated to comply. Moreover, we are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We also publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements regarding data privacy and security, including statements relied on by our users, advertisers, and business partners. If these policies, materials, or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in \nPart I\n\ntransparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences, including class-action litigation or mass arbitration demands.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, data privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or our data privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, or other failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or regulatory scrutiny, can result in governmental enforcement actions or litigation that could expose our business to substantial financial penalties, or other monetary or non-monetary relief, negative publicity, loss of confidence in our products, decline in user or advertiser growth or damage to our brand and reputation. Companies in the technology industry have recently experienced increased regulatory scrutiny relating to data privacy and data protection, and we have become subject to enhanced scrutiny and enforcement actions from regulators to ensure compliance with data privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, and other such laws and regulations impose new and burdensome obligations, and include substantial uncertainty as to their interpretation, and we are subject to challenges in addressing their requirements, which could result in fines or penalties, lead us to change our data privacy policies and practices, how our product currently operates, and limit our ability to deliver personalized advertising by, for example, requiring users to opt-in to personalized advertising. Public statements and complaints against us by consumer advocacy groups or others could also cause users to lose trust in us, which could result in declines in user growth, retention or engagement and have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and business. Additionally, if third parties that we work with, such as advertisers, service providers or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, these violations may also put users’ information at risk.\nThe implementation and enforcement, including through private rights of action, of these increasingly complex, onerous, or divergent laws and regulations, and the introduction, interpretation, or revision of any new such laws or regulations, with respect to privacy, security, data protection, and our industry are uncertain and may further complicate compliance efforts, lead to fragmentation of the service, and may increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and our third-party partners, or decrease the perceived usefulness of our service to our users and advertisers. For example, some federal privacy laws are currently being challenged, and litigation in this space could impact the privacy rights of our community, which in turn may negatively impact users' experience, trust, and satisfaction and decrease their engagement with our products. Many of these obligations are becoming increasingly stringent and subject to rapid change and uncertain interpretation. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources, and there is no guarantee that our compliance efforts to date, or in the future, will be deemed compliant or sufficient. \nAny significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices, or to interpretations of existing laws and regulations, regarding the use or disclosure of users’ data, or regarding requirements around obtaining consent from users for the use and disclosure of such data, could require us to modify our products to allow for limited data use, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products that make use of the data that users voluntarily share. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service, particularly as we expand our operations internationally.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale our technology infrastructure, including speed and availability of our service.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve users, content creators and advertisers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our service and our underlying technology infrastructure and content delivery processes. From time to time, we experience interruptions in or disruptions of our systems. If our platform is unavailable when users, content creators or advertisers attempt to access it, if it does not load as quickly as they expect or if their content is not saved, users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all.\nOur advertisers must be able to easily buy, forecast, optimize and measure the performance of ads on a responsive and stable platform. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if our technology infrastructure is not reliable. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could harm our business. Our systems may not be adequately designed to avoid performance delays or outages. We have gaps in our ability to deploy changes safely to the site, which increases the risk of disruptive intentional and unintentional (and potentially premature) updates and changes being made directly to our live platforms and services. As our user, content and advertiser base, sophistication of our machine learning models and the volume and types of information shared on our service continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technology infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy the needs of users, content creators and advertisers, which could increase our costs. We may be unable to effectively scale and grow our technology infrastructure \nPart I\n\nto accommodate these increased demands or to achieve our business objectives. Further, in the event of a systems failure, employee error, failure or interruption of services by AWS, or malicious intent by employees or third parties, we may lose all or substantial amounts of data and we may not be able to recover such data quickly or at all.\nIn addition, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage, delays or interruptions from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, spikes in usage volume, epidemics, pandemic and other public health emergencies, terrorist attacks, acts of war, geopolitical conflicts, other physical security threats, cyber-security attacks, earthquakes, the effects of climate change, power and space shortages in our cloud infrastructure and other events beyond our control. We are particularly vulnerable to these types of events because our cloud computing infrastructure is currently located in one geographic region. In addition, the substantial majority of our employees are located in California, which has historically experienced, and may continue to experience, climate-related events including drought and water scarcity, warmer temperatures, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shut-offs. If there is a catastrophic failure involving our systems or major disruptive event affecting our headquarters or the San Francisco area in general, we may be unable to operate our service. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services and could cause us to incur substantial expense. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact, have the potential to disrupt our business and/or the business of our third-party suppliers and partners. Any of the foregoing events can result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services.\nA substantial portion of our technology infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic or cause our platform to become unavailable. We exercise little control over these providers and have limited line of sight into their governance, and any financial or other difficulties these providers face may harm our business.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such risks or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. These events may result in distraction of management, loss of revenue and costs from litigation and enforcement. In addition, they could also result in significant expense to repair or replace damaged facilities and remedy resultant data loss or corruption. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our products could materially harm our reputation and business.\nThe failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, or loss of one or more of our key personnel, could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including William Ready and others. Mr. Ready's employment, and the employment of our other key personnel, is at will, which means they may resign or be terminated for any reason at any time. Similarly, Mr. Silbermann is currently non-executive Chair of the Board and may resign at any time. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of management as well as our key engineering, design, marketing, sales and product development personnel, could disrupt our operations and harm our business. This risk is particularly heightened in an environment where companies, including us, slow down hiring or reduce their workforce and will continue to find ways to further reduce costs due to macroeconomic conditions. \nIn addition, it is important to our business to attract and retain highly talented personnel, particularly engineers with expertise in computer vision, AI and machine learning. We have found and may continue to find our recruiting and retention efforts more challenging because the marketplace for talent is highly competitive. The incentives provided by our stock option grants, restricted stock grants and restricted stock unit grants, or by other compensation and benefits arrangements, may not be effective to attract and retain employees, especially as a result of continued fluctuations in our stock price. We may also be required to enhance wages, benefits and non-equity incentives. If we are unable to meet employees' and potential employees' expectations, we may experience difficulties attracting and retaining personnel.\nFurther, our ongoing efforts to implement terms of the settlement agreement with respect to certain derivative lawsuits and resolve certain related allegations or claims have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs, as well as consuming management's time and attention. Further, if efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion are perceived as insufficient or overdone, we may not be able to attract and retain talent, we may be subject to investigations, litigation and other proceedings and our brand and reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nWe currently have a flexible work model which provides for a more distributed workforce. Our work strategy, including our efforts related to employee onboarding, training and development and retention may not be successful. Further, our work strategy may continue to evolve and may not meet the needs of our existing and potential future employees, and they may prefer work models offered by other companies. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel or the financial resources required to do so increase, we may not be able to meet our business objectives.\nPart I\n\nRisks Arising from Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe depend in part on online application stores and internet search engines to direct traffic and refer new users to our platform. When these online application stores or search engines’ methodologies and policies are modified or enforced in ways we do not anticipate, or when our search results page rankings decline for other reasons, traffic to our platform or user growth, retention and engagement has declined and could decline in the future.\nWe depend in part on internet search engines, such as Bing, Google and Yahoo!, to direct a significant amount of traffic to our platform. For example, when a user types a query into a search engine, we may receive traffic and acquire new users when those search results include Pins, boards, users and other features of our platform that cause the user to click on the Pinterest result or create a Pinterest account. These actions grow our users due to signups of new users and increase retention and engagement of existing users.\nOur ability to maintain and increase the number of users directed to our platform from search engines is not within our control. Search engines, such as Google, have and may continue to modify their search algorithms (including what content they index and the format in which content is indexed) and policies or enforce those policies in ways that are detrimental to us, that we are not able to predict or without prior notice. When that occurs, we have in the past and expect to experience in the future, declines or de-indexing in the organic search ranking of certain Pinterest search results or negative impacts due to the format in which our search results appear, leading to a decrease in traffic to our platform, new user signups and existing user retention and engagement. We have experienced declines in traffic and user growth as a result of these changes in the past, and anticipate fluctuations as a result of such actions in the future. For example, changes to search engine algorithms have in the past and may in the future negatively impact traffic and user sign-ups. Our ability to appeal these actions is limited, and we may not be able to revise our search engine optimization (“SEO”) strategies to recover the loss in traffic or users resulting from such actions. In addition, changes in policies or their enforcement may not apply in the same manner to our competitors, or our competitors’ SEO strategies to retain and attract users may be more successful than ours. In addition, certain third parties offer browser extensions that give users the option to remove Pinterest from their search engine recommendations. Further, some of these search engines are owned by companies that compete with various aspects of our business. When email platforms, such as Google, change their policies related to the placement of our emails in users' inboxes, it can affect the open and click rate of our emails. Such changes have led to and may lead to a decrease in traffic to our platform, new user signups and existing user retention and engagement. To offset some of the impact on our user growth, we have and may continue to increase our investment in other growth strategies, such as paid marketing or other initiatives that drive user acquisition, which may cost more and be less effective. Any significant reduction in the number of users directed to our website or mobile application from search engines or email could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nIn addition, we also rely on certain major online stores for distribution of our application. If these application store providers modify or implement new terms, we may be required to modify our product to maintain our ability to remain in that application store.\nWe allow users to authenticate with our service through third-party login providers. If these third parties discontinue these tools or experience a breach or outage in their platform or web browser developers make changes that restrict the use of these tools, user retention, growth or engagement could decline. \nA significant number of users access their accounts on our platform using a third-party login provider such as Facebook, Apple or Google. If security on those platforms is compromised, if users are locked out from their accounts on those platforms or if those platforms experience an outage or otherwise institute policies that prevent users from accessing their accounts on our platform through those logins, users may be unable to access our platform. In addition, third-party log-in providers may institute policies that restrict us from both communicating with users or identifying users. As a result of these actions, user growth, retention and engagement on our platform has been and could be adversely affected in the future, even if only for a temporary period. Additionally, if Facebook or Google discontinue their identity services or experience an outage, then we may lose and be unable to recover users previously using this function, and our user growth or engagement could decline. \nWe depend on Amazon Web Services for the vast majority of our compute, storage, data transfer and other services. Any disruption of, degradation in or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could negatively affect our operations. \nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides the cloud computing infrastructure we use to host our website, mobile application and many of the internal tools we use to operate our business. Under our long-term agreement with AWS, in return for negotiated concessions, we currently are required to maintain a substantial majority of our monthly usage of certain compute, storage, data transfer and other services on AWS. This agreement is terminable only under certain conditions, including by either party following the other party’s material breach, which may be the result of circumstances that are beyond our control. A material breach of this agreement by us, or early termination of the agreement, could carry substantial penalties, including liquidated damages. If AWS increases pricing terms, terminates or seeks to terminate our \nPart I\n\ncontractual relationship, establishes more favorable relationships with our competitors, or changes or interprets its terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable, those actions could harm our business, revenue and financial results. \nAny significant disruption of, limitation of our access to or other interference with our use of AWS would negatively impact our operations. In addition, any transition of the cloud services currently provided by AWS to another cloud services provider would be difficult to implement and would cause us to incur significant time and expense and could disrupt or degrade our ability to deliver our products and services. The level of service provided by AWS could affect the availability or speed of our services. If users, creators, publishers or advertisers are not able to access our service or platform or encounter difficulties in doing so, we may lose users, creators, publishers or advertisers. \nWe utilize data center hosting facilities operated by AWS, located in various facilities. However, we have implemented a limited disaster recovery program which does not allow us to serve network traffic from back-up data center services. An unexpected disruption of services provided by these data centers could hamper our ability to handle existing or increased traffic, result in the loss of data or cause our platform to become unavailable. \nWe must effectively operate with mobile operating systems, web browsers, online application stores, networks, regulations and standards, which we do not control. Changes in our products or to those mobile operating systems, web browsers, networks, regulations or standards may harm user retention, growth and engagement. \nBecause our platform is used on mobile devices and through web browsers, our application must remain interoperable with popular mobile operating systems and browsers, including Android, Chrome, iOS and Safari. We have no control over these operating systems and browsers. Any changes to these operating systems, browsers or the online stores distributing our application that impact the accessibility, speed or functionality of our service or give preferential treatment to competitive products, could harm usage of our platform. Some of our competitors that control the operating systems, browsers and online stores that our application runs on, or is distributed through, could make interoperability of our service with those systems, browsers and stores more difficult. In addition, new products we introduce may take longer to function with these systems and browsers. \nIf we are unable to deliver consistent, high-quality user experiences across different devices with different operating systems, user growth, retention or engagement may decline. \nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws governing internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. Regulatory changes could limit users’ ability to access our service or make our platform a less attractive alternative to our competitors’ platforms and cause our user growth, retention or engagement to decline. \nIf it becomes more difficult for users to access and use our service on their browsers or mobile devices, if users choose not to access or use our platform on their mobile devices, or if users choose to use mobile products that limit access to our platform, user growth, retention and engagement may decline.\nWe rely on software, technologies and related services from third parties, and problems in their use, access or performance could increase our costs.\nWe rely on software, technologies and related services from third parties to operate critical functions of our business. Third-party technologies or services that we utilize may become unavailable due to a variety of reasons, including outages, interruptions or failure to perform under our agreement. Unexpected delays in their availability or function can, in turn, affect the use or availability of our platform. Further, third-party software and service providers may no longer provide such software and services on commercially reasonable terms or may fail to properly maintain or update their software. In such instances, we may be required to seek licenses to software or services from other parties or to redesign our products to function with new software or services. This could result in delays in the release of new products until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our platform and services. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future products.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads. \nTechnologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that block the display of our ads. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and ad blocking technologies can prevent the display of certain of our ads. Existing ad blocking technologies that have not been effective on our platform can later become effective as we make certain product changes, and new ad blocking technologies are often in development. More users may choose to use products that block or obscure the display of our ads if we are unable to successfully balance the amount of organic content and paid advertisements, or if users’ attitudes toward advertisements become more negative. Further, regardless of their effectiveness, ad blockers may generate concern regarding the health of the digital advertising industry, which could reduce the value of digital advertising. \nPart I\n\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe may be liable as a result of content or information that is published or made available on our platform.\nWe are subject to many U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data use, data security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), harmful or illegal content, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance. We may be sued or face regulatory action for claims relating to content or information that is published or made available on our platform. Our systems, tools and personnel that help us to proactively detect potentially policy-violating or otherwise inappropriate content cannot identify all such content on our service, and in many cases this content will appear on our platform. This risk may increase as we develop and increase the use of certain products or product features, such as video content, for which identifying such content is challenging. Additionally, some controversial content may not be banned on our platform and, even if it is not featured in advertisements or recommendations to users, may still appear in search results or be saved on boards. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States where our protection from liability for content published on our platform by third parties may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Further, if policy-violating content is found on our platform, we may be in violation of the terms of certain of our key agreements, which may result in termination of the agreement and, in some cases, payment of damages. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, damages.\nWe rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our platform, including but not limited to, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), the Communications Decency Act (\"CDA\"), the fair-use doctrine in the United States, the EU E-Commerce Directive, the EU AI Act and the DSA. These frameworks and defenses may limit but do not necessarily eliminate, our potential liability for caching, hosting, listing or linking to third-party content that may include materials that infringe copyrights or are otherwise unlawful. Each of these statutes and doctrines is subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments, and we cannot guarantee that such frameworks and defenses will be available for our protection. For example, the CDA has been amended by Congress and interpreted by courts in ways that have narrowed its applicability. If the rules around these doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections to the US, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our service, we could incur liability or be required to make significant changes to our products, business practices or operations.\nLawmakers in the United States and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for content available on our platform. There are a number of new laws and legislative proposals in the United States and globally aimed at limiting the scope of protections available to online services and/or that further impose new obligations affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement, illegal or harmful content, distributing targeted and other advertisements to teens, and other forms of unlawful content and/or online harm. These legislative and/or regulatory requirements may increase our costs of operations, our liability for content posted by users on our platform, our litigation costs, and/or may expose us to regulatory sanctions such as fines or penalties. If these or other additional statutory or regulatory changes reduce liability protections for content published on our platform, we may be required to make significant changes to our business model, including increasing our content moderation operations and building in additional product features or tools that may not be favorable to our business, add payment obligations or compliance costs. \nWe are also subject to fines or orders restricting or blocking our service in particular countries as a result of content on our platform. For example, certain countries have implemented regulations that authorize fines or provide for throttling or blocking services for failures to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations, and other countries may enact similar legislation, which would impose penalties for failure to remove certain content. There can be no assurance that the tools we use for certain removal obligations or any new custom tools we develop will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the new regulations.\nAny new legislation or changes to existing legislation may be difficult to comply with in a timely and comprehensive fashion and may expose our business, users, or employees to increased fees and costs. These costs could be prohibitively expensive for a company of our size, which could prevent us from launching a product or require us to restrict access to a product in a particular market. This could disadvantage us relative to our competitors with more resources. If the rules, doctrines or currently available defenses change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections that are currently available in the United States or the European Union or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our platform, we could be required to expend significant resources to try to comply with the new rules or incur liability.\nPart I\n\nGovernment actions can restrict access to our product or certain of our products in their countries. \nGovernmental authorities outside the United States have restricted, and may in the future seek to restrict access to our platform if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or for other reasons. For example, access to our service has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in certain countries. Other governments may seek to restrict access to or block our platform, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our platform, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our platform in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. We may also decide to stop offering our platform in a country as a result of these types of restrictions. For example, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content, to appoint local representatives in the country, or to store user data within that country. It can be challenging or impractical to manage the requirements of multiple jurisdictions governing the type and nature of the content available on our platform. If additional prohibitions or restrictions are imposed on our platform, or if our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our user growth, retention and engagement may be adversely affected.\nWe could become involved in legal disputes that are expensive to support, and if resolved adversely, could harm our business, revenue and financial results. \nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, actual and threatened legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, mass arbitrations, claims, investigations and government inquiries arising in the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, data privacy and data protection, privacy and other torts, illegal or objectionable content, consumer protection, AI, safety, law enforcement, civil rights, the use of our platform for illegal purposes, securities, stockholder derivative claims, employment, governance, workplace culture, contractual rights, civil rights infringement, false or misleading advertising, or other legal claims relating to content or information that is provided to us or published or made available on our platform. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries involving us, whether successful or not, can be time consuming, result in costly litigation, unfavorable outcomes, high indemnification expenses, increased costs of business, may require us to change our business practices or products, product offerings and features, require significant amount of management’s time, may harm our reputation or otherwise harm our business and future financial results.\nWe are currently involved in, have been subject to, and expect to be subject in the future to actual and threatened litigation with respect to third-party patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, and may continue to be subject to intellectual property litigation and threats thereof. Companies in the internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, grow our business and products, and become increasingly high profile, the possibility of receiving a larger number of intellectual property claims against us grows. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights have asserted, and may in the future attempt to assert, intellectual property claims against us to extract value through licensing or other settlements.\nFrom time to time, we receive letters from patent and trademark holders alleging that some of our products infringe their patent and trademark rights. We also receive letters from copyright and trademark owners alleging that content on Pinterest infringes their intellectual property rights, including take-down requests. Our technologies and content, including the content that users save on our service, may not be able to withstand such third-party claims. \nWith respect to any intellectual property claims, we may have to seek a license to continue using technologies or engaging in practices found to be in violation of a third-party’s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may not be available to us at all and may require us to discontinue use of such technologies or practices or to develop alternative non-infringing technologies or practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technologies or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be achievable at all.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished. \nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a combination of confidentiality, invention assignment and license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We have filed various applications for certain aspects of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries, and we currently hold issued patents in multiple jurisdictions. However, there can be no assurance that each of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. In addition, any resulting issued patents may have claims narrower than those in our patent applications. There can be no assurance that each of our trademark registration applications will result in the issuance of a trademark or that each resulting trademark registration will be able to be maintained. In the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios, license patents from third parties or agree to license the use of our patents to third parties, which could \nPart I\n\nrequire significant cash expenditures. Additionally, our current and future patents, trademarks and other intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid.\nThird parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe or challenge our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. We may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial time and expense, if at all. Similarly, particularly as we expand the scope of our business and the countries in which we operate, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, or challenging our use of, our intellectual property rights, including those used to build and distinguish the “Pinterest” brand. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our technologies, products, services or features or methods of operations. \nOur use of “open source” software could subject us to possible litigation or could prevent us from offering products that include open source software or require us to obtain licenses on unfavorable terms. \nA portion of the technologies we use incorporates “open-source” software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source licenses may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Some open source software may include generative AI software or other software that incorporates or relies on generative AI. The use of such software may expose us to risks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and tools have not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or addressed by federal or state regulations.\nWe also license to others some of our software through open source projects which requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. If an author or other third-party that distributes open-source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from offering our products that contained the open source software, required to release proprietary source code, required to obtain licenses from third parties or otherwise required to comply with the unfavorable conditions unless and until we can re-engineer the product so that it complies with the open source license or does not incorporate the open source software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our ability to offer our products and harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nThe interpretation and application of U.S. tax legislation or other changes in U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of our operations could harm our business, revenue and financial results. \nTax reform has been a priority for governments worldwide and numerous proposals have been proposed or enacted. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) changed how the United States imposes income tax on multinational corporations in a number of ways. One such change was the elimination of the option to deduct research and development expenses and, as a result, our net operating loss utilization has been accelerated. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance may affect our analysis of the impact of the law on us and may harm our operating results and financial condition. \nAdditionally, over the last several years, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Several countries have already begun to enact legislation to implement the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax regime. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as further jurisdictions enact legislation. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current international tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and which apply to our business. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may proliferate in the absence of multilateral agreement.\nFurther changes to the U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of our operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, resulting in additional taxes or other costs or have other material consequences.\nPart I\n\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Statements and Performance\nWe have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance. \nWe have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. You should not rely on our past results of operations as indicators of future performance. You should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies like ours.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, anticipate increasing our costs and operating expenses, may incur operating losses in the future and may not maintain profitability. \nWe have incurred significant net losses in the past and generated net income only recently. We generated net income of $1,862.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and net losses of $35.6 million and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $288.2 million. We have achieved profitability only recently and may not realize sufficient revenue to maintain profitability in future periods. \nWe incur high operating expenses and may increase our operating expenses in the future as we continue to evolve or expand our business and operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, operating delays or other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. We have significant unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over the next several years. In addition, we have entered into certain non-cancelable commitments that limit our ability to reduce our cost and expenses in the future. For more information, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Notes to Financial Statements.\" Any failure to increase our revenue as we implement initiatives to grow our business could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes them difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results are tied to certain key business metrics that have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which makes them difficult to predict. Our operating results depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n•our ability to generate revenue from our platform; \n•our ability to improve or maintain gross margins; \n•our ability to maintain operating margins, cash used in operating activities and free cash flow;\n•the number and relevancy of advertisements shown to users; \n•the relevancy of content shown to users;\n•the manner in which users engage with different products, where certain products may cause us to generate less revenue; \n•downward pressure on the pricing of our advertisements; \n•the timing, cost and mix of new and existing marketing and promotional efforts as we grow and expand our operations to remain competitive; \n•fluctuations (seasonal or otherwise) in spending by our advertisers and platform usage and engagement by users, each of which may change as our product offerings and business evolves; \n•seasonal fluctuations in engagement on our platform, including our historical experience of lower engagement in our second quarter;\n•fluctuations in spending by our advertisers and platform usage and engagement by users due to macroeconomic conditions, such as the stress in the banking industry, inflation or new or increased tariffs;\n•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage generally; \n•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads; \n•development and introduction of new product offerings by us or our competitors; \n•the enforcement of our advertising policies, including the removal of ads and advertisers from our platform; \n•existing, new and evolving regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally;\n•the ability of our third-party providers to scale effectively and provide the necessary technical infrastructure for our service on a timely basis; \nPart I\n\n•system failures, disruptions, breaches of security or data privacy or internet downtime, whether on our service or on those of third parties; \n•the inaccessibility of our service due to third-party actions; \n•changes in measurement of our metrics; \n•costs associated with the technical infrastructure used to operate our business, including hosting services; \n•fluctuations in the amount of share-based compensation expense;\n•fluctuations, caused by stock price volatility, in the amount we spend to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") as we continue to net settle such RSUs; and\n•our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changing internet business or macroeconomic conditions; and the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUser metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nWe regularly review metrics, including the number of our active users and other measures to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. While these numbers are based on what we currently believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations globally. Our metrics calculations may be inaccurate, and we may not be able to identify those inaccuracies. In the past, we have relied on other metrics that measure different activities, such as saving a Pin, clicking, searching and other activities, as indicators of user growth and engagement. We have in the past implemented, and may from time to time in the future implement, new methodologies for calculating these metrics, which may result in the metrics changing or decreasing from prior periods or not being comparable to prior periods. Our metrics may also differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or data used.\nOur MAU metrics may also be impacted by our information quality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on our platform, including false, spam and malicious automation accounts in existence on our platform. We make efforts to regularly deactivate false, spam and malicious automation accounts that violate our terms of service and exclude these users from the calculation of our MAU metrics; however, we will not succeed in identifying and removing all false, spam and malicious accounts from our platform. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to estimate the total number of false, spam or malicious accounts and we intend to continue to make such improvements, but there is no guarantee as to the accuracy of these estimates. In addition, users are not prohibited from having more than one account on our platform, and we treat multiple accounts held by a single person as multiple users for purposes of calculating our active users.\nIn addition, some of our user demographic data may be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, because users self-report their date of birth, our age-demographic data may differ from users’ actual ages or be unavailable. We receive age-demographic data for a portion of those users from other third-party accounts that users chose to authenticate with on our platform, such as Facebook and Google, but there can be no assurance that those platforms will continue to give us permission to access that data or that the data we receive from those third parties is accurate. In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of users and revenue by user geography is estimated based on a number of factors, which may not always accurately reflect the actual location and may be different depending on the metric we are calculating. If our metrics provide us with incorrect or incomplete information about users and their behavior, we may make inaccurate conclusions about our business.\nOur operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain additional financing, if needed, or if we default on our credit obligations.\nWe may require additional financing to maintain and grow our business. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, investor demand and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our domestic assets, as well as certain domestic intellectual property, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. It contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay \nPart I\n\ndividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, incur liens, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell material businesses or assets, or license or transfer certain of our intellectual property. In addition, we are also required to maintain a minimum consolidated leverage. Complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants under the revolving credit facility, lenders would have a right to, among other things, terminate the commitments to provide additional loans under the facility, enforce any liens on collateral securing the obligations under the facility, declare all outstanding loans and accrued interest and fees to be due and payable and require us to post cash collateral to be held as security for any reimbursement obligations in respect of any outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility. If any remedies under the facility were exercised, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, operations and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAdditionally, our revolving credit facility utilizes a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or various alternative methods set forth in our revolving credit facility to calculate the amount of accrued interest on any borrowings. If a published U.S. dollar SOFR is unavailable, the interest rates on our debt indexed to SOFR will be determined using one of the alternative methods, any of which could, if the revolver is drawn, result in interest obligations that are more than the current form, which could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs.\nWe may have greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nWe operate in a number of tax jurisdictions globally, including in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in many other countries, and plan to continue to expand the scale of our operations in the future. Thus, we are subject to review and potential audit by a number of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and challenge our tax positions. Successful unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities, including in the context of our current or future corporate operating structure and third-party and intercompany arrangements (including transfer pricing and the manner in which we develop, value and use our intellectual property), may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, result in additional taxes or other costs or have other material consequences, which could harm our business and financial results.\nAlthough we do not currently incur significant tax costs due to our history of operating losses, our tax liabilities may increase if our profitability increases in the future. In addition, our effective tax rate may change from year to year based on changes in the mix of activities and income allocated or earned among various jurisdictions, tax laws and the applicable tax rates in these jurisdictions (including future tax laws that may become material), tax treaties between countries, our eligibility for benefits under those tax treaties and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such changes could result in an increase in the effective tax rate applicable to all or a portion of our income, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nOur ability to use or benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal, California and other state net operating loss carryforwards of $1,909.5 million, $554.3 million and $1,549.9 million, respectively. Our federal carryforwards do not expire. If not utilized, our California and other state carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and 2025, respectively. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, may be subject to annual limitations, or could be subject to other limitations on utilization or benefit due to the ownership change limitations provided by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and other similar provisions. Further, the Tax Act changed the federal rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer’s ability to utilize such carryforwards to 80% of taxable income. In addition, net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is generally prohibited. Net operating loss carryforwards generated before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the Tax Act’s taxable income limitation and will continue to have a twenty-year carryforward period. Nevertheless, our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could expire before utilization and could be subject to limitations.\nAdverse global economic and financial conditions could harm our business and financial condition.\nAdverse global economic and financial events, such as epidemics, pandemics and other public health emergencies, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, recession or fears of recession, inflation, fluctuation in foreign exchange rate, supply chain issues, and inventory and labor shortages, have caused, and could in the future, continue to cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets. Such conditions have resulted in or may result in, among other things, an adverse impact on the ability and willingness of companies to spend on advertising, volatility in our stock price, and an \nPart I\n\nadverse impact on the financial condition of the institutions with whom we hold deposits or the credit quality of the issuers of our cash equivalents and marketable securities. In addition, since the majority of our revenue is derived from advertisers within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have a greater impact on us. \nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. \nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program, the program does not require us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could also affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination or change of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, any purchases made under this program would diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A common stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), including our co-founders, executive officers, employees and directors, their affiliates, and all of our other pre-IPO stockholders (including those unaffiliated with any of our co-founders, executive officers, employees or directors). This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has twenty votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Because of the 20-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our outstanding Class B hold approximately 73.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2024. Because the holders of our Class B common stock hold in the aggregate significantly more than a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock, such holders (which include our pre-IPO stockholders who have not converted their Class B common stock to Class A common stock, including those holders unaffiliated with any of our executive officers, employees or directors) control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. The holders of Class B common stock will no longer hold in the aggregate over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock once the Class B common stock represents in the aggregate less than approximately 4.76% of our outstanding capital stock. \nAs a result, for the foreseeable future, holders of our Class B common stock could have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company and over the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, even though their stock holdings were to represent in the aggregate less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. These holders of our Class B common stock may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This control may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. Despite no longer being employed by us, Paul Sciarra and Benjamin Silbermann, two of our co-founders, remain able to exercise significant voting power. \nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, except certain transfers to entities, including certain charities and foundations, to the extent the transferor retains sole dispositive power and exclusive voting control with respect to the shares of Class B common stock, and certain other transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In addition, all shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock on (i) the seven-year anniversary of the closing date of our IPO, except with respect to shares of Class B common stock held by any holder that continues to beneficially own at least 50% of the number of shares of Class B common stock that such holder beneficially owned immediately prior to completion of our IPO, and (ii) a date that is between 90 to 540 days, as determined by the board of directors, after the death or permanent incapacity of Mr. Silbermann. Conversions of Class B common stock to Class A common stock have already had and will continue to have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. \nOur dual class structure may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices, recommend that stockholders vote against certain company annual stockholder meeting proposals or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices or any actions or \nPart I\n\npublications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could adversely affect the value and trading market of our Class A common stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; \n•volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks; \n•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; \n•sales, or anticipated sales, of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, including when stockholders sell shares of our Class A common stock into the market to cover taxes due upon the settlement of RSUs or the exercise of stock options, or conversions, or anticipated conversions, of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock by our stockholders;\n•actions and investment positions taken by institutional and other stockholders, including activist investors; \n•failure by industry or securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, downgrade of our Class A common stock by analysts or provision of a more favorable recommendation of our competitors; \n•failure by analysts to regularly publish research reports or the publication of an unfavorable or inaccurate report about our business; \n•changes by external analysts to their financial and operating estimates for our company or our performance relative to third parties' estimates or the expectations;\n•forward-looking financial or operating information or financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in that information or projections or our failure to meet projections; \n•any indebtedness we may incur in the future; \n•whether investors or securities analysts view our stock structure unfavorably, particularly our dual class structure and the significant voting control of holders of our Class B common stock; \n•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, services, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \n•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base or level of engagement, or those of our competitors; \n•the public’s perception of the quality and accuracy of our key metrics on our user base and engagement; \n•the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; \n•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; \n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our user growth, retention, engagement, revenue or other operating results; \n•actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally; \n•litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators and other third parties into our operations or those of our competitors; \n•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; \n•developments or disputes concerning our culture or other inclusion practices and initiatives or the inability to address any workplace culture related issues;\n•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services or technologies by us or our competitors; \n•existing, new and evolving regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally; \n•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; \n•any significant changes in our management;\nPart I\n\n•stakeholder dissatisfaction if we are unable to meet stakeholders' expectations and requirements or our publicly announced goals around environmentally friendly, ethical, socially conscious, and sustainable business practices or disclosures;\n•adoption and trading under a stock repurchase program;\n•macroeconomic events that are beyond our control, including tariffs; and \n•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets. \nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies, including ours, have fluctuated in a manner that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of such companies. Following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action and derivative litigation has often been instituted against these companies, including against us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Further, when our revenue, users or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our Class A common stock has declined and could likely decline in the future.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us or existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional capital stock or offering debt or other securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions could also require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations.\nIssuing additional shares of capital stock or other securities, including securities convertible into equity, may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders, reduce the market price of our Class A common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. In addition, the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock bear the risk that our future offerings or future sales of shares may reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and dilute their stockholdings in our company.\nAdditional stock issuances, including in connection with settlement of equity awards, could result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nFuture issuances of shares of our Class A common stock or the conversion of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock, or the perception that these sales or conversions may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and result in significant dilution for holders of our Class A common stock. We currently have shares of Class B common stock that may be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options and shares of Class A common stock that may be issued upon settlement of outstanding stock options, RSUs, or restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"). For more information, see “Notes to Financial Statements”. As of December 31, 2024, we had 5,852,600,274 shares of authorized but unissued Class A common stock that are currently not reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans or charitable giving program. We may issue all of these shares of Class A common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue Class A common stock or other securities in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our equity incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options, settlement of RSUs and RSAs or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our Class A common stockholders.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination \nPart I\n\nwith an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n•our dual class common stock structure, which provides our holders of Class B common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock; \n•our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause; \n•certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require the approval of 66⅔% of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock;\n•approval of 66⅔% of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock, voting as a single class, is required for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n•our stockholders can take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent; \n•vacancies on our board of directors can be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders; \n•no provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws provides for cumulative voting, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; \n•only our chairman of the board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president or another officer selected by a majority of the board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; \n•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware; \n•nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our Class A common stock; \n•our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of our capital stock; and \n•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders. \nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal district court in the state of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court’s having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Act or Exchange Act from bringing such claims in federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nPart I",
