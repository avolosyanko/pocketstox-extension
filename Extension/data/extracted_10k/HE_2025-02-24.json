      "text": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nHEI Consolidated\nHEI and subsidiaries and lines of business.  HEI is a holding company with its subsidiaries principally engaged in electric utility and non-regulated renewable/sustainable infrastructure businesses operating in the State of Hawaii. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s sources of funds are dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries, borrowings, and sales of equity. The rights of HEI and its creditors and shareholders to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of HEI’s subsidiaries are subject to the prior claims of the creditors and preferred shareholders of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of HEI in its capacity as a creditor are recognized as primary. The abilities of certain of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions (see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). HEI is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii and has one reportable segment: Electric utility. HEI and its other subsidiaries which are not reportable segments are grouped and reported as an “All Other” non-reportable segment.\nElectric Utility.  Hawaiian Electric and its operating utility subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (Hawaii Electric Light) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (Maui Electric), are regulated electric public utilities that provide essential electric service to approximately 95% of Hawaii’s population through the operation of five separate grids that serve communities on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai. See also “Electric utility” section below. \nAll Other. The All Other non-reportable segment is composed of HEI’s corporate-level operating, general and administrative expenses and the results of Pacific Current, LLC (Pacific Current). Pacific Current was formed in September 2017 to focus on investing in non-regulated clean energy and sustainable infrastructure in the State of Hawaii to help reach the state’s sustainability goals. See also “Electric utility—Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs” section below and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Pacific Current activities. The All Other segment also includes ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii) (a holding company), which previously owned ASB.\nAdditional information.  Prior to December 31, 2024, ASB Hawaii owned ASB, a federally chartered, full-service Hawaii community bank. ASB was a reportable segment of HEI, until its sale on December 31, 2024. For additional information about HEI, see HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company’s website address is www.hei.com, where annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports (last 10 years) are made available free of charge in the Investor Relations section as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC (and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov). The information on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K unless, and except to the extent, specifically incorporated herein by reference. HEI and Hawaiian Electric intend to continue to use HEI’s website as a means of disclosing additional information. Accordingly, investors should routinely monitor such portions of HEI’s website, in addition to following HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Investors may also wish to refer to the PUC website at hpuc.my.site.com/cdms/s/ in order to review documents filed with and issued by the PUC. No information at the PUC website is incorporated herein by reference, and the Company has no control over its accuracy or completeness.\nRegulation.  HEI and Hawaiian Electric are each holding companies within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and implementing regulations, which requires holding companies and their subsidiaries to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) access to books and records relating to FERC’s jurisdictional rates. FERC granted HEI and Hawaiian Electric a waiver from its record retention, accounting and reporting requirements, effective May 2006.\nHEI is subject to an agreement entered into with the PUC (the PUC Agreement) which, among other things, requires PUC approval of any change in control of HEI. The PUC Agreement also requires HEI to provide the PUC with periodic financial information and other reports concerning intercompany transactions and other matters. It also prohibits the electric utilities from loaning funds to HEI or its nonutility subsidiaries and from redeeming common stock of the electric utility subsidiaries without PUC approval. Further, the PUC could limit the ability of the electric utility subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock. See also Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Electric utility—Regulation” below. \nIn October 2021, Pacific Current requested informal guidance from the PUC regarding application of the affiliate transaction requirements (ATRs) to certain investments. In response, in January 2022, the PUC issued guidance (Order No. 38186, Docket No. 2018-0065) providing that, if Pacific Current acquires or invests in an unaffiliated entity that has been awarded a power purchase agreement with the Utilities through the Stage 1 or 2 Request for proposals (RFPs), such entity \n1\n\n\nwould become an “Affiliate” or “Affiliate-Related Entity” under the ATRs, and any wholesale power transactions between the entity and the Utilities, including under the awarded power purchase agreement, would require PUC review and approval. Such a requirement may impact Pacific Current’s competitiveness in acquiring and investing in new utility-scale projects in the Utilities’ service territory and thereby impact the pace and extent of Pacific Current’s growth. As a result of the D&O, Pacific Current intended to focus its future growth activities on projects not subject to a power purchase agreement with the Utilities or projects outside of the Utilities’ service territory. However, subsequent to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, HEI and Pacific Current have suspended any new investments while undertaking a comprehensive review of strategic options for certain assets of Pacific Current.\nOn December 30, 2024, HEI, ASB and ASB Hawaii entered into investment agreements to sell 90.1% of the common stock of ASB to various investors, including certain ASB officers and directors of ASB, while retaining 9.9% of the common stock of ASB. The sale transaction closed on December 31, 2024 and no investor, including HEI, retains or owns more than 9.9% of the common stock of ASB. As HEI and ASB Hawaii no longer have a controlling interest in ASB, HEI and ASB Hawaii are in the process of deregistering themselves as “unitary savings and loan holding companies” and upon final deregistration approval, would no longer be subject to applicable federal and state regulation and supervision (including under the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). \nAs part of HEI’s comprehensive review of strategic options for certain assets of Pacific Current, on February 7, 2025, Pacific Current entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell all the membership interests in Hamakua Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, to an unaffiliated third party for cash consideration to be determined under the provisions of the agreement. Hamakua Holdings, LLC has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Hamakua Energy, LLC, which owns a 60-MW combined cycle power plant that sells power to Hawaii Electric Light under an existing power purchase agreement, and HAESP, LLC (created in connection with the current on-going Stage 3 RFP process). Upon closing, both Hamakua Energy and HAESP, LLC as wholly-owned subsidiaries of Hamakua Holdings will no longer be owned by Pacific Current. The close of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions and is expected to be finalized in March 2025. The sale transaction is not expected to have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental regulation.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state statutes and governmental regulations pertaining to water quality, air quality and other environmental factors. See the “Environmental regulation” discussion in the “Electric utility” section below, and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHuman Capital Resources. The Company’s workforce and culture are critical to its ability to achieve its business strategies. As such, the Company seeks to attract, retain and develop a talented workforce and create a high-performing, inclusive and safety-driven culture. \nEmployees.  The Company had total and full-time employees as follows:\n\nDecember 31                                                                        2024                                                  2023                                                  2022\n                                                       Total                  Full-time                      Total                  Full-time                      Total                  Full-time\n                                                   employees                  employees                  employees                  employees                  employees                  employees\nHEI                                                 69                         69                         75                         75                         79                         79      \nHawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries           2,533                      2,518                      2,654                      2,564                      2,605                      2,511      \nASB                                                  —                          —                        977                        958                      1,072                      1,050      \n                                                 2,602                      2,587                      3,706                      3,597                      3,756                      3,640      \n Includes consolidated Pacific Current employees. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, HEI corporate had 44, 45, and 41 employees, respectively.\n Beginning December 31, 2024, as a result of the sale transaction, ASB was no longer a subsidiary of HEI.\nThe employees of HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than the electric utilities, are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The Utilities target compensation at market rates, and due to the significant increase in competitive market pay for linemen over the past few years, provided an 11.4% market rate adjustment and a 4% annual incentive for linemen effective February 1, 2024. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260 represents roughly half of the Utilities’ workforce covered by a collective bargaining agreement. On January 26, 2024, a new three-year contract was ratified and will be in effect from November 1, 2024 through October 31, 2027. The contract provides for a 3% general wage increase in each year of the three-year contract, double time for callouts, and a 1% incentive payment upon achievement of specified objectives. \nCulture of inclusion and belonging. The Company views fostering an inclusive culture – where all employees can thrive and feel they belong – as key to its success. The Company believes such a culture promotes collaboration, trust, engagement, excellence and innovation, in turn enhancing problem-solving and decision-making. The Company believes that a workforce comprised of a diverse array of backgrounds, experiences, skills and perspectives strengthens the Company’s ability to meet the needs of its customers, communities and stakeholders. Operating exclusively in Hawaii, one of the most culturally diverse states \nin the U.S., the Company also recognizes the importance of having a workforce that understands its customer base, including Hawaii’s unique culture, history and demographics.\nEmployee development & training. In order to meet the changing demands of the industries in which the Company operates, address the needs of the Company’s stakeholders, attract, engage and retain talented employees, and design and carry out the Company’s strategies, it is crucial for the Company’s workforce to be highly skilled in their areas of focus and be able to adapt and evolve over time. As such, the Company invests in specific skill enhancement training as well as industry and leadership development programs. \nHawaiian Electric offers Hawaiian Electric and HEI holding company employees skills and professional training programs, including leadership development courses, employee development courses, technical training, apprenticeship programs, operational, environmental compliance, cybersecurity awareness and required safety training. Hawaiian Electric also offers tailored leadership development programs, including supervisor training to transition new supervisors to critical operational, administrative, and leadership roles as well as leadership and employee assessments geared to improve productivity and \neffectiveness in the workplace. Learning and development initiatives align with individual and organizational performance, and are reinforced in the annual performance evaluation process. Ongoing leadership succession planning ensures the identification and development of successors, high potential individuals, and nurtures a leadership pipeline.\nSafety and health.  As a core value, the Company strives to create workplace environments that prioritize the physical and emotional well-being of its employees. For the Utility, safety is of paramount importance due to the inherent risks involved in certain aspects of its operations and the critical role the Utility plays in maintaining the electrical grid for the State of Hawaii.\nHawaiian Electric is committed to maintaining a strong safety culture. Due to the intrinsic nature of its operations, safety is part of Hawaiian Electric’s DNA. Management proactively assumes the responsibility of providing visible leadership and strategic direction for the health and safety management system and programs in their area of oversight. This leadership and direction are instrumental to building and sustaining a resilient safety culture and drive continual safety improvement. Allocating adequate resources to enable seamless implementation of safety programs and holding leaders accountable for the implementation of safety programs and resulting health and safety performance are strategic requirements. This commitment is shown in executive compensation, which is tied to the achievement of recordable incidents and lost workdays targets. These targets reward improvements in workplace safety, promote employee well-being, and contribute to long-term expense reductions. Hawaiian Electric promotes a safety culture that aims for zero incidents, with every employee taking ownership of their own safety, as well as that of their co-workers, contractors, and the public. More information on such targets is available in HEI’s annual proxy statement. \nHawaiian Electric is creating a culture of total well-being to support its employees from hire to retire and beyond by instituting best practices and advancing wellness as a business strategy. Some of the programs and benefits that foster employees’ total well-being include emotional, physical, occupational, social, spiritual, intellectual, environmental and financial. These programs include access to an extensive Employee Assistance Program for employees and their family members, participation in various community charity walks, wellness related trainings and resources, onsite mental health support, a wide variety of corporate wellness activities, gym and group fitness discounts, and financial wellness classes.\nWorkforce Stability. The Company’s employees are its greatest asset and the Company strives to create a highly desirable place to work. \nHawaiian Electric seeks to provide compensation and benefits that are comprehensive, market-competitive, and internally equitable to attract, engage, and retain highly skilled employees. Hawaiian Electric believes that employee engagement is key to creating a desirable, inclusive, rewarding place to work and conducts employee engagement surveys on a regular cycle. Hawaiian Electric is expanding its strategic workforce planning initiative to build its workforce to support future transformation plans. \nProperties.  HEI leases office space from a nonaffiliated lessor in downtown Honolulu under leases that expire in December 2027. See “Electric Utility” section for a description of properties owned and leased.\nHamakua Energy, LLC (Hamakua Energy), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, which is included in the “All Other” segment, owns a 60-MW dual-train combined-cycle facility and a total of approximately 93 acres located on the Hamakua coast on the island of Hawaii. Its power plant is situated on approximately 59 acres and the remaining 34 acres includes surrounding parcels of which 30 acres are located on the ocean front. On February 7, 2025, the parent company of Hamakua Holdings, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of HEI and parent company of Hamakua Energy, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell all of the membership interests in Hamakua Holdings, LLC to an unaffiliated third party. The sale is expected to close in March 2025. Kaʻieʻie Waho Company, LLC (Kaʻieʻie Waho), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, owns a 6-MW solar photovoltaic facility located on approximately 20 acres on the southern coast of the island of Kauai. \nMahipapa, LLC (Mahipapa), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, owns a 7.5- MW biomass facility located on approximately 65 acres of land and leases 3,500 acres on the island of Kauai.\nElectric utility\nHawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric (Utilities) are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu; Hawaii; and Maui, Lanai and Molokai, respectively. \n    In 2024, the electric utilities’ revenues and net loss amounted to approximately 100% and 93% respectively, of HEI’s consolidated revenues and loss from continuing operations. The electric utilities’ revenues and net income amounted to approximately 99% and 133% in 2023 and approximately 100% and 117% in 2022, respectively, of HEI’s consolidated revenues and income from continuing operations. \nThe islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai have a combined population estimated at 1.4 million, or approximately 95% of the total population of the State of Hawaii, and comprise a service area of 5,815 square miles. The principal communities served include Honolulu (on Oahu), Hilo and Kona (on Hawaii) and Wailuku and Kahului (on Maui). The service areas also include numerous suburban communities, resorts, U.S. Armed Forces installations and agricultural operations. In November 2020, the PUC approved Hawaiian Electric’s acquisition of the electric distribution systems serving 12 U.S. Army installations on Oahu, including Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Army Airfield, Tripler Army Medical Center, Fort Shafter and Army housing areas. \nThe state has granted Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric nonexclusive franchises, which authorize the Utilities to construct, operate and maintain facilities over and under public streets and sidewalks. Each of these franchises will continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until forfeited, altered, amended or repealed.\nClimate change action plan. In 2021, the Utilities set an aggressive goal to cut carbon emissions from power generation 70% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The emissions covered by this goal include stack emissions from generation owned by Hawaiian Electric and independent power producers (IPPs) who sell electricity to the Utilities. In addition, the Utilities have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045 or sooner. \nKey elements of the 2030 plan to reduce emissions include:\n•    The closing of the state’s last coal plant, which occurred in September 2022 upon expiry of the PPA\n•    Adding nearly 50,000 rooftop solar systems, more than a 50% increase, compared to the approximately 90,000 systems online in 2021 when the Climate Change action plan was developed\n•    Retiring at least six fossil-fueled generating units and significantly reducing the use of others as new renewable resources come online\n•    Adding additional renewable energy projects capable of generating a total of at least 1 gigawatt beyond resources in place in 2021, including shared solar (community-based renewable energy)\n•    Using more grid-scale and customer-owned energy storage\n•    Expanding geothermal resources\n•    Creating innovative programs that provide customers incentives for using clean, lower-cost energy at certain times of the day and using less fossil-fueled energy at night\nSince the time the 2030 goal was established, delays and cancellations in the commercial operation of new renewable third-party generation resources and higher costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, as well as federal policies related to solar panel imports, have slowed the pace of progress toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The downgrade of Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings after the Maui windstorm and wildfires, which makes it more difficult for independent power producers to procure low-cost financing, has added an additional impediment to completion of new renewable energy and storage projects. As a result of these challenges, the Utilities expect the planned 70% reduction in carbon emissions to be achieved later than the original 2030 target date. However, the Utilities will continue to replace significant amounts of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy between now and 2030 and expect to meet or exceed the State of Hawaii’s RPS goals.\nAfter 2030, progress on elimination of carbon from power generation assumes continued use of proven resources, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, biofuels and energy storage, along with the development of new and existing technologies. Those technologies may include offshore wind, green hydrogen, wave energy and carbon-capture—all currently under development around the world—as well as other solutions that will emerge. A diverse portfolio of resources will also enhance resilience to climate-related events.\nSales of electricity.\n\nYears ended December 31                                                                  2024   2023                                                                       2022                                                                    \n(dollars in thousands)              Customer accounts*                Electric sales revenues                  Customer accounts*                Electric sales revenues                  Customer accounts*                Electric sales revenues\nHawaiian Electric                     310,336                            $2,246,646                              309,631                            $2,324,044                              306,978                            $2,422,232          \nHawaii Electric Light                  90,522                               475,556                               89,477                               458,157                               88,757                               479,566          \nMaui Electric                          71,678                               434,810                               72,497                               443,017                               73,933                               464,823          \n                                      472,536                            $3,157,012                              471,605                            $3,225,218                              469,668                            $3,366,621          \n* As of December 31.\nRegulatory mechanisms. Base electric rates are set in rate cases, and on April 29, 2020, the PUC issued an order terminating the mandatory triennial rate case cycle in anticipation of the performance-based regulation framework (PBR Framework). The regulatory framework in effect in 2020 included a number of mechanisms designed to provide utility financial stability during the transition toward the state’s 100% renewable energy goals. For example, under the sales decoupling mechanism, the Utilities are allowed to recover from customers, target test year revenues, independent of the level of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales. The decoupling mechanism (i.e., the Revenue Balancing Account) continues under the PBR Framework.\nOn December 23, 2020, the PUC issued a D&O in Phase 2 of the PBR proceeding, establishing the PBR Framework for the Utilities. The PBR Framework includes, among other matters, a five-year multi-year rate plan with an index-driven annual revenue adjustment (ARA), which replaces the RAM, modification of the MPIR mechanism (renamed Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM)) to include deferred and operation and maintenance (O&M) expense projects and to permit the Utilities to include the full amount of approved costs in the EPRM for recovery in the first year the project goes into service, pro-rated for the portion of the year the project is in service, and continuation of (i) the revenue balancing account, (ii) the pension and other postretirement benefit tracking mechanisms, and (iii) energy cost recovery clause, purchased power adjustment clause, and other recovery mechanisms. See “Commitments and contingencies-Regulatory proceedings-Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThese regulatory mechanisms are summarized as follows:\n\nMechanism                                                                              Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nSales decoupling                                                                       Provides predictable revenue stream by fixing net revenues at the level approved in last rate case (revenues not linked to kWh sales).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAnnual Revenue Adjustment (ARA)                                                        Annually adjusts revenue levels during a Multi-Year Rate Period, determined by formula which includes an inflation factor, a predetermined productivity adjustment (currently set at zero), adjustments for exceptional circumstances not in the Utilities’ control and a customer dividend component. The ARA replaced the Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) effective June 1, 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                           \nExceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM)                                          Reduces regulatory lag and permits recovery of revenues for net costs of approved eligible projects placed in service during the Multi-Year Rate Period through the revenue balancing account (RBA) that is not provided for by other effective tariffs, the ARA, Performance Incentive Mechanism (PIMS) or Shared Savings Mechanisms (SSMs). The EPRM was formerly known as the Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism.                                                                                                                                     \nEnergy cost recovery clause (ECRC) and purchased power adjustment clause (PPAC)        Allows for timely recovery of fuel and purchased power costs to reduce earnings volatility. Symmetrical fossil fuel cost risk-sharing (98% customer/2% utility) mechanism established for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric capped at $2.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million annually, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nPerformance incentive mechanism (PIM) / Shared Savings Mechanism (SSM)                 Annually adjusts revenue to recover from or credit customers for specific areas of the Utilities’ performance measured against the PUC’s approved targets. Adding a portfolio of SSMs and new PIMs is intended to encourage acceleration in renewables, grid services, interconnection of DERs, low-to-moderate income energy efficiency, advanced metering infrastructure, generation-based reliability (penalties only), interconnection of utility scale renewable projects, and cost control of non-ARA costs and allow for financial rewards for exemplary performance.     \nPension and other post-employment benefit trackers                                     Allows tracking of pension and other post-employment benefit costs and contributions above or below the cost included in rates in a separate regulatory asset/liability account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nRenewable energy infrastructure program                                                Permits recovery of renewable energy infrastructure projects through a surcharge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nPilot Process                                                                          Fosters innovation by establishing an expedited implementation process for pilots that test new technologies, programs, business models and other arrangements and allows for timely cost recovery of annual expenditures of approved pilot projects through an adjustment to target revenues. Proposed pilots are subject to PUC approval with a total annual cap of $10 million.                                                                                                                                                                                               \nEarnings Sharing Mechanism (ESM)                                                       Protects the Utilities and customers from excessive earnings or losses, as measured by the Utilities’ achieved rate making ROACE; reflecting a symmetrical ESM for achieved rate making ROACE outside of a 300 basis points dead band above or below the current authorized ROACE of 9.5% for each of the Utilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nSeasonality.  kWh sales of the Utilities follow a seasonal pattern, but they do not experience extreme seasonal variations experienced by some electric utilities on the U.S. mainland. In Hawaii, kWh sales tend to increase in the warmer, more humid months as a result of increased demand for air conditioning and higher visitor arrivals. This is partially offset by the reduction of sales due to privately owned customer photovoltaic (PV) systems which generate the most energy during the aforementioned warmer months.\nSignificant customers.  The Utilities derived approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of their operating revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively from the sale of electricity to various federal government agencies. Hawaiian Electric continues to work with various federal agencies to implement measures that will help them achieve their energy efficiency, resilience and clean energy objectives.\nSelected

PGV’s current limited capability of 32.2 MW has been incorporated into the utility’s firm contract power capability as of December 31, 2024.\nNoncoincident and nonintegrated.\nGenerating reliability and reserve margin.  Hawaiian Electric serves the island of Oahu and Hawaii Electric Light serves the island of Hawaii. Maui Electric has three separate electrical systems—one each on the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric have isolated electrical systems that are not currently interconnected to each other or to any other electrical grid and, thus, each maintains a higher level of reserve generation and cost structure than is typically carried by interconnected mainland U.S. utilities, which are able to share reserve capacity. These higher levels of reserve margins are required to meet peak electric demands, to provide for scheduled maintenance of generating units (including the units operated by IPPs relied upon for firm capacity) and to allow for the forced outage of the largest generating unit in the system.\nNonutility generation.  The Utilities have supported state and federal energy policies which encourage the development of renewable energy sources that reduce the use of fuel oil as well as the development of qualifying facilities. The Utilities’ renewable energy sources and potential sources range from wind, solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, wave and hydroelectric power to energy produced by municipal waste and other biofuels.\nThe rate schedules of the electric utilities contain ECRCs and PPACs that allow them to recover costs of fuel and purchase power expenses. \nIn addition to the firm capacity PPAs described below, the electric utilities also purchase energy on an as-available basis directly from nonutility generators and through its Feed-In Tariff programs, as well as through renewable dispatchable generation power purchase agreements. The electric utilities also receive renewable energy from customers under its customer-sited DER programs.\nThe PUC has allowed rate recovery for the firm capacity and purchased energy costs for the electric utilities’ approved firm capacity and as-available energy PPAs.\nHawaiian Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaiian Electric currently has two major firm capacity PPAs that provide a total of 276.5 MW of firm capacity, representing 19% of Hawaiian Electric’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Oahu as of December 31, 2024.\nUnder a 1988 PPA, as amended, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 208 MW of firm capacity from Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa). The Kalaeloa facility, which is a Qualifying Facility (QF), is a combined-cycle operation, consisting \nof two oil-fired combustion turbines burning low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. The PPA term ended on May 23, 2016 and was extended while the parties were in negotiations for a new agreement. The parties executed an Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement (ARPPA) on October 29, 2021, which among other provisions extends the term for ten contract years after the effective date. The ARPPA was approved on November 23, 2022. The parties executed a letter agreement to establish that the rates under the ARPPA became effective on January 1, 2023.\nHawaiian Electric also entered into a PPA in March 1986 and a firm capacity amendment in April 1991 with the City and County of Honolulu with respect to a refuse-fired plant (HPOWER). Under the PPA, as amended and restated, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 68.5 MW of firm capacity annually up until the PPA expires on April 2, 2033.\nHawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaii Electric Light has two major firm capacity PPAs that provide a total of 85.7 MW of firm capacity, representing 33% of Hawaii Electric Light’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Hawaii as of December 31, 2024.\nIn October 1997, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an agreement with Encogen, which was succeeded by Hamakua Energy Partners, L. P. (HEP). The agreement requires Hawaii Electric Light to purchase up to 60 MW (net) of firm capacity for a period of 30 years, expiring on December 31, 2030. The dual-train combined-cycle facility consists of two oil-fired combustion turbines and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines, which primarily burns naphtha (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons) and, starting in late 2019, biodiesel (comprising approximately 41.8% of HEP’s fuel mix in 2024). In November 2017, Hamakua Energy, an indirect subsidiary of HEI, purchased the plant from HEP. On February 7, 2025, the parent company of Hamakua Holdings, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of HEI and parent company of Hamakua Energy, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell all the membership interests in Hamakua Holdings, LLC to an unaffiliated third party. The sale is expected to close in March 2025. See “Sale of Hamakua Holdings, LLC” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHawaii Electric Light has a 35-year PPA, as amended, with Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) for 34.6 MW of firm capacity from its geothermal steam facility, which will expire on December 31, 2027. However, the PGV facility went offline in May 2018 due to lava flow on Hawaii Island. In March 2019, Hawaii Electric Light entered into a Rebuild Agreement with PGV, which sets forth the parties’ respective responsibilities associated with restoration of the facility. The Rebuild Agreement shall govern the terms until PGV becomes fully operational. PGV returned to service at a level providing limited output without firm capacity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is currently providing 32.2 MW of capacity. In December 2019, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an Amended and Restated PPA (ARPPA) with PGV to, among other things, extend the term by 25 years to 2052 and expand the firm capacity capable of being delivered to 46 MW. The ARPPA was approved by the PUC subject to certain conditions on December 29, 2023. See “New renewable PPAs” in the “Developments in renewable energy efforts” section in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A. \nMaui Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Maui Electric currently has no firm capacity PPAs. \nFuel oil usage and supply.  The rate schedules of the Utilities include ECRCs under which electric rates (and consequently the revenues of the electric utility subsidiaries generally) are adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. See discussion of rates and issues relating to the ECRC below under “Rates.”\nHawaiian Electric’s steam generating units consume LSFO and Hawaiian Electric’s combustion turbine peaking units consume diesel. Hawaiian Electric’s Schofield Generating Station consumes mostly B99 grade biodiesel, but is permitted to also burn ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD).\nHawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s steam generating units burn high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) and Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui combustion turbine generating units burn diesel. Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui, Molokai, and Lanai diesel engine generating units burn ULSD. \nSee “Fuel contracts” in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A.\nThe following table sets forth the average cost of fuel oil used by Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric to generate electricity in 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n\n                                      Hawaiian Electric                                      Hawaii Electric Light                                           Maui Electric                                            Consolidated\n                  $/Barrel                       ¢/MBtu                   $/Barrel                          ¢/MBtu                   $/Barrel                       ¢/MBtu                   $/Barrel                       ¢/MBtu\n     2024      114.42                      1,839.5                     117.55                         1,960.3                     115.93                      1,945.6                     115.00                      1,868.2     \n     2023      127.45                      2,051.1                     124.04                         2,063.7                     124.86                      2,101.1                     126.73                      2,060.0     \n     2022      144.63                      2,339.5                     131.36                         2,183.4                     135.39                      2,274.5                     141.49                      2,310.9     \nThe average per-unit cost of fuel oil consumed to generate electricity for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric reflects a different volume mix of fuel types and grades as follows:\n\n                                              Hawaiian Electric                                 Hawaii Electric Light                                      Maui Electric\n                  % LSFO                     % Biodiesel/Diesel                  % HSFO                      % Diesel                  % HSFO                   % Diesel\n     2024        93                                  7                          32                            68                      26                         74     \n     2023        92                                  8                          35                            65                      22                         78     \n     2022        93                                  7                          36                            64                      24                         76     \nThe prices that Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light pay for purchased energy from certain older nonutility generators are generally linked to the price of oil. The energy prices for Kalaeloa, which purchases LSFO from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (PAR), vary primarily with the price of Asian crude oil. On December 31, 2019, Hawaii Electric Light and PGV entered into an Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement, which delinks the pricing for energy delivered from the facility from fossil fuel prices. Hamakua Energy’s energy prices vary primarily with the cost of naphtha.\nThe Utilities estimate that 69% of the net energy they generate will come from fossil fuel oil in 2025 compared to 74% in 2024. Hawaiian Electric generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to 47 days of forward consumption. Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric generally maintain an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to approximately one month’s supply of both HSFO and diesel. The PPA with Hamakua Energy requires that it maintains certain minimum fuel inventory levels.\nRates.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other matters. See “Regulation” below.\nGeneral rate increases require the prior approval of the PUC after public and contested case hearings. Rates for Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries include ECRCs, and PPACs. Under current law and practices, specific and separate PUC approval is not required for each rate change pursuant to automatic rate adjustment clauses previously approved by the PUC. Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) requires the PUC to periodically review the adjustment clauses related to energy cost of electric and gas utilities in the state, and such clauses, as well as the rates charged by the utilities generally, are subject to change. PUC approval is also required for all surcharges and adjustments before they are reflected in rates.\nSee “Utility projects” under “Commitments and contingencies” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCompetition.  See “Competition” in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A.\nRegulation.  The PUC regulates the rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other aspects of the operations of Hawaiian Electric and its electric utility subsidiaries. See the previous discussion under “Rates”.\nOn September 15, 2014, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recognizing that Hawaii is embarking on the next phase of its clean energy future. The MOU provides the framework for a comprehensive, sustained effort to better realize its vast renewable energy potential and allow Hawaii to push forward in three main areas: the power sector, transportation and energy efficiency. This next phase is focused on stimulating deployment of clean energy infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, energy system innovation and test bed investments.\nElectrification of Transportation. In June 2018, the PUC initiated a proceeding to review the Utilities’ Electrification of Transportation (EoT) Strategic Roadmap, which provided an economic analysis for light duty electric vehicles on the island of Oahu, Maui and Hawaii. The Utilities subsequently filed an update in May 2024, called the EoT Strategic Roadmap 2.0 to reflect changes to market conditions since 2018 and identifies potential utility EoT actions through 2030, through input from community and industry experts. \nIn October 2019, the Utilities filed their EoT Workplan, establishing a schedule to continue implementation of the EoT roadmap with a focus on EV rate design and make ready charging infrastructure in the near term. The Utilities followed through \non the EoT Workplan, with three filings: the electric bus make ready infrastructure pilot, Charge Ready Hawaii commercial infrastructure pilot, and two commercial EV rates, EV-J and EV-P. The Utilities completed the 18-month Smart Charge Hawaii Telematics pilot in December 2024. \nThe Utilities operate 32 public DC fast chargers (DCFC) as part of the EV-U pilot and EV-MAUI tariff. They filed a request in the fourth quarter of 2021 to expand and make permanent the public charging pilot with an additional 150 DCFCs and 150 level 2 charging stations at 75 locations. On August 20, 2024, the PUC suspended the docket effective September 6, 2024, in line with the Utilities request for suspension filed on August 13, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Utilities learned they were not awarded federal funding as part of the Federal Joint Office and Fueling Infrastructure grant. On January 15, 2025, the Utilities filed an update to the PUC responding to their December 10, 2024 letter with a status update on changes to the priority, timing, and ability to commit funds to the application once they hear back from the Department of Energy Loan Program Office.\nIn August 2020, the Utilities committed to electrifying 100% of its class 1 vehicles (sedans, SUVs and light trucks) by 2035.\nRenewable Portfolio Standards. In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS since 2014 (only electrical generation using renewable energy as a source counts). In July 2022, former Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. For example, the 2022 RPS achieved under the revised RPS calculation would have been 39.1% under the prior method versus 31.8% under the revised method. The change in the definition is to be applied prospectively to future milestone measurements and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones; however, the Utilities expect to continue to meet the RPS milestones under the amended RPS law to exceed the 2030 RPS requirement of 40%. The ability of the Utilities to meet RPS milestones after 2030 may be impacted by the Utilities’ current credit ratings, which may impact independent power producers’ ability to secure low-cost financing. In 2024, the Utilities’ RPS was 35.8%.\nAffiliate transactions. Certain transactions between HEI’s electric public utility subsidiaries (Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric) and HEI and affiliated interests (as defined by statute) are subject to regulation by the PUC. \nIn December 1996, the PUC issued an order in a docket to review the relationship between HEI and Hawaiian Electric and the effects of that relationship on the operations of Hawaiian Electric. The order required Hawaiian Electric to continue to provide the PUC with periodic status reports on its compliance with the PUC Agreement (pursuant to which HEI became the holding company of Hawaiian Electric). Hawaiian Electric files such status reports annually. In the order, the PUC also required the Utilities to present a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the holding company structure and investments in nonutility subsidiaries have on a case-by-case basis on the cost of capital to each utility in future rate cases and remove any such effects from the cost of capital. The Utilities have made presentations in their subsequent rate cases to support their positions that there was no evidence that would modify the PUC’s finding that Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital did not suffer as a result of HEI’s involvement in nonutility activities and that HEI’s diversification did not permanently raise or lower the cost of capital incorporated into the rates paid by Hawaiian Electric’s utility customers.\nIn December 2018, the PUC established a set of requirements governing transactions and sharing of information between the Utilities and its affiliates (Affiliate Transaction Requirements, ATRs), which was subsequently modified and clarified in January 2019 following the Utilities’ motion for reconsideration. The PUC stated the intent of the ATRs is to establish safeguards to avoid potential market power benefits and cross-subsidization between regulated and unregulated activities. The requirements include rules on interactions with affiliates, information handling, business development, political activities, promotional activities, sales of products and services, and employee sharing restrictions. The ATRs include implementing an internal code of conduct, a compliance plan, including policies and procedures to comply with the requirements, and having an audit conducted every three years that examines the compliance with the requirements. Penalties for non-compliance depend on the severity of the violation, and can range from daily fines to divestiture of the Utilities by the holding company. The second external audit is anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2025 and the selection of the external auditor is pending PUC review and approval.\nOther regulations. The Utilities are not subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act, except under Sections 210 through 212 (added by Title II of PURPA and amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992), which permit the FERC to order electric utilities to interconnect with qualifying cogenerators and small power producers, and to wheel power to other electric utilities. Title I of PURPA, which relates to retail regulatory policies for electric utilities, and Title VII of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992, which addresses transmission access, also apply to the Utilities. The Utilities are also required to file various operational reports with the FERC.\nBecause they are located in the State of Hawaii, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries are exempt by statute from limitations set forth in the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 on the use of petroleum as a primary energy source.\nRegulatory Developments. See “Regulatory proceedings” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions.\nSee also “HEI Consolidated–Regulation” above.\nEnvironmental regulation.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and, in some cases, local environmental regulatory agencies, including agencies responsible for the regulation of water quality, air quality, hazardous and other waste and hazardous materials. These inspections may result in the identification of items needing corrective or other action. Except as otherwise disclosed in this report (see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, and Notes 1 and 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Utilities believe that each subsidiary has appropriately responded to environmental conditions requiring action and that, as a result of such actions, such environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Utilities.\nWater quality controls.  The generating stations, substations and other utility facilities operate under federal and state water quality regulations and permits, including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (governing point source discharges, including wastewater and storm water discharges) and the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (regulating disposal of wastewater into the subsurface).\nOil pollution controls.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes programs that govern actual or threatened oil releases and imposes strict liability on responsible parties for clean-up costs and damages to natural resources and property. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations under OPA require certain facilities that use or store oil to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans in order to prevent releases of oil to navigable waters of the U.S. Certain facilities are also required to prepare and implement Facility Response Plans (FRPs) to ensure prompt and proper response to releases of oil. The utility facilities that are subject to SPCC Plan and FRP requirements have prepared and implemented SPCC Plans and FRPs.\nAir quality controls.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes permitting programs to reduce air pollution. The CAA amendments of 1990, established the federal Title V Operating Permit Program (in Hawaii known as the Covered Source Permit program) to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state air pollution control requirements. The 1977 CAA Amendments established the New Source Review (NSR) permitting program, which affect new or modified generating units by requiring a permit to construct under the CAA and the controls necessary to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. \nTitle V operating permits have been issued for all of the Utilities’ affected generating units.\nHazardous waste and toxic substances controls.  The operations of the electric utility are subject to EPA regulations that implement provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, also known as Superfund), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as well as equivalent State laws and regulations.\nRCRA underground storage tank (UST) regulations require all facilities that use USTs for storing petroleum products to comply with established leak detection, spill prevention, standards for tank design and retrofits, financial assurance, operator training, and tank decommissioning and closure requirements. All of the Utilities’ USTs currently meet the applicable requirements.\nThe Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act under SARA Title III requires the Utilities to report potentially hazardous chemicals present in their facilities in order to provide the public with information so that emergency procedures can be established to protect the public in the event of hazardous chemical releases. Since January 1, 1998, the steam electric industry category has been subject to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements.\nThe TSCA regulations specify procedures for the handling and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a compound found in some transformer and capacitor dielectric fluids. The TSCA regulations also apply to responses to releases of PCBs to the environment. The Utilities have instituted procedures to monitor compliance with these regulations and have implemented a program to identify and replace PCB transformers and capacitors in their systems. \nHawaii’s Environmental Response Law (ERL), as amended, governs releases of hazardous substances, including oil, to the environment in areas within the state’s jurisdiction. Responsible parties under the ERL may be jointly, severally, and strictly \nliable for a release of a hazardous substance. Responsible parties include owners or operators of a facility where a hazardous substance is located and any person who at the time of disposal of the hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substance was disposed.\nThe Utilities periodically discover leaking oil-containing equipment such as USTs, piping, and transformers. Each subsidiary reports releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and addresses the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nState and Federal Endangered Species Act. Under the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts species that are listed as threatened or endangered are to be protected from harm. Various activities of the Utilities including vegetation management, operations, construction, and the presence of infrastructure in sensitive areas may have the potential to affect such species. The Utilities have developed best management practices, protocols and in some areas are developing habitat conservation plans and obtaining related permits to help protect these species.\nAdditional information.

      "text": "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\nThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nHolding company and company-wide risks.\nPotential losses resulting from the Maui windstorm and wildfires could have a material adverse effect on HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. On August 8, 2023, a number of brush fires in the West Maui (Lahaina) and Upcountry Maui areas caused widespread property damage, including damage to property of the Utilities, and 102 confirmed fatalities in Lahaina (the Maui windstorm and wildfires). The Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety (MFD) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reports classified the cause of the fire as “accidental.” \nMultiple lawsuits have been filed against the Utilities and HEI alleging, among other things, that they were negligent in failing to prevent the wildfires that led to the property destruction and loss of life. The amount of any liability arising from the Maui windstorm and wildfires (which could exceed amounts currently reserved for the settlement liability), whether determined at trial or through a negotiated settlement, could have a material adverse impact on HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, HEI and the Utilities have approximately $13 million, nil and $122 million of insurance coverage remaining under the excess liability, professional liability, and directors and officers liability policies, respectively, after deducting applicable retention amounts, amounts that have been recovered under insurance policies (including the One ‘Ohana Initiative contribution), and amounts expected to be recovered for incurred costs and recognized as a receivable as of year-end. \nHEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financings in a timely manner and on acceptable terms will continue to be negatively impacted as a result of the downgrades in their debt credit ratings to below investment grade. In August 2023, HEI and Hawaiian Electric received multiple downgrades to their debt, including to ratings below investment grade, by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. As of February 14, 2025, the Fitch, Moody’s and S&P ratings of HEI and Hawaiian Electric were as follows:\n\n                                                                                             Fitch          Moody’s        S&amp;P     \nHEI:                                                                                                                                   \nLong-term issuer default, long-term corporate family and issuer credit, respectively         B              B1             B-          \nShort-term issuer default, commercial paper and commercial paper, respectively               B              NP             B           \nOutlook                                                                                      Stable         Stable         Negative    \nHawaiian Electric:                                                                                                                     \nLong-term issuer default, long-term and issuer credit, respectively                          B              Ba3            B-          \nShort-term issuer default, commercial paper and commercial paper, respectively               B              NP             B           \nSenior unsecured debt/special purpose revenue bonds                                          B+             Ba3            *           \nCumulative preferred stock (selected series)                                                 *              B3             *           \nOutlook                                                                                      Stable         Stable         Negative    \n*    Not rated.\nNote: The above ratings reflect only the view, at the time the ratings are issued or affirmed, of the applicable rating agency, from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nUnless and until these debt ratings are upgraded to investment grade, the Company will continue to have restricted access to capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financings, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. Recent projects, such as, wildfire mitigation plan, grid modernization, reliability and resilience all require significant capital expenditures to implement. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing to achieve its business objectives as a result of the downgrades. Accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely impacted if debt credit ratings are maintained at below investment grade for an extended period of time. \nHEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Because HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings were downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are unable to sell commercial paper and were required to draw on more expensive \nbank lines of credit and prioritize capital and other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict the duration of the downgrades and future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nExtreme weather events and other natural disasters, particularly those exacerbated by climate change such as the Maui windstorm and wildfires, could materially affect Hawaiian Electric’s assets and infrastructure, particularly if such infrastructure is damaged or is found to have contributed to other catastrophic events such as a wildfire. Extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions, mudslides, hurricanes, tsunamis and other storms, can interfere with the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver electricity to customers. Damage to Hawaiian Electric’s infrastructure can also cause or contribute to additional loss through events such as wildfires. These risks are increasing, as climate change has exacerbated some of the conditions that lead to these extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such an event can result in lost revenue and increased expenses for the Utilities, but it also can result in regulatory penalties and disallowances if Hawaiian Electric is unable to restore power on a timely basis. Also, an extreme event can lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property, and has been the case with the Maui windstorm and wildfires. Therefore, these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nHolding Company Risk—HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its principal operating subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, and depends on the ability of Hawaiian Electric to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from Hawaiian Electric and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. A material reduction or delay in dividends or other distributions by Hawaiian Electric for an extended period of time, such as a continuation or expansion of the reduction in dividends that HEI currently is experiencing due to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:\n•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC (PUC Agreement), which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities. As of December 31, 2024, the consolidated common stock equity of HEI’s electric utility subsidiaries was 33% of their total capitalization based on the current definition under the PUC Agreement and, as a result, the Utilities are restricted in cash payment of their dividend to HEI at this time (see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.);\n•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.\nCredit and Capital Market Risk—The Company, and its lowered credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy, including catastrophic events such as the Maui windstorm and wildfire (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries), the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by: Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism; by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions; and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars (such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war), conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).\nChanges in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, a significant reduction in the discount rate or in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets could result in a substantial increase in the gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.\nHEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.\nThere may be future conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and it is possible that any plan developed to alleviate such doubt may be unsuccessful. In addition, any capital raised may result in dilution to our current shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred losses from continuing operations of approximately $1.32 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Utilities incurred net losses of approximately $1.23 billion. The net losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, were primarily due to the accruals of estimated wildfire liabilities in the second and third quarters of 2024, totaling approximately $1.92 billion related to the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims. The Company previously disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, that based on its financial and liquidity condition, and because it had not yet implemented a capital financing plan to address proposed wildfire settlement payments, there was substantial doubt about HEI’s and the Utilities’ ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement believes the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amount of $751 million and GLST1’s restricted cash amount of $479 million, both as of December 31, 2024, the available capacity on Hawaiian Electric’s asset-based lending facility (ABL Facility) (see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein), additional liquidity under HEI’s recently registered ATM program as well as expenditure reduction efforts effectively alleviate any conditions that may cause substantial doubt regarding HEI’s and Utilities’ ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has adequate cash to meet its financial obligations and sustain operations in the short term, including available sufficient liquidity to fund the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims expected to be made no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2025 and its other cash obligations for the next 12 months following the issuance of its financial statements. The plans that have been implemented have mitigated the conditions that previously caused the substantial doubt about HEI’s and the Utilities’ ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of filing their 2024 second quarter financial statements. Although the Company has raised sufficient cash to pay the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims, the Company is currently working with its financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the additional capital necessary to fund the remaining settlement of wildfire tort claims. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital, there is no assurance that management’s plans will be successful. If the financing plans are unsuccessful, the Company may need to consider other strategic alternatives.\nThe recurrence of any substantial doubt about HEI’s and the Utilities’ ability to continue as a going concern may affect the price of our common stock, may impact our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our vendors, lenders and employees, may impact our ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt and may impact our ability to comply, going forward, with certain covenants in our debt agreements and/or satisfy conditions to draw thereunder, which could significantly and materially restrict our operations.\nIf a court-approved definitive settlement agreement to resolve Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims is not obtained, or if financing for settlement payments is not available, we may need to consider other alternatives for addressing the outstanding legal claims or settlement payments, and such alternatives could adversely affect our financial results or other factors impacting our finances, operations or stock valuation. As described more fully in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, the Company entered into Settlement Agreements effective November 1, 2024, to resolve all Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims, including all claims among the defendants. Such Settlement Agreements are subject to court approval, and other conditions including resolution of the claims of the insurance companies that have paid claims for property loss and other damages. If all conditions of the Settlement Agreements are satisfied, the Company has agreed to make substantial payments to settle all Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims. As described more fully in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, if the conditions of the Settlement Agreements are not satisfied or the agreements are otherwise terminated, the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance proceeds will be available to fund any potential settlements, judgments, or costs associated with the litigation. \nIf all conditions of the Settlement Agreements are satisfied, the Company expects to finance the settlement payments through a mix of debt, common equity, equity-linked securities or other potential options. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the capital necessary to finance the settlement payments, there is no assurance that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts, on a timely basis or on reasonable terms acceptable to us, if at all. \nIf the Company’s financing plans are unsuccessful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including delaying strategic initiatives, selling assets, or other strategic measures including, without limitation, obtaining relief under the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code. Such alternatives could adversely affect our financial results or other factors impacting our finances, operations or stock valuation.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings. In order to raise additional capital, including capital necessary to fund litigation settlement expenses, the Company may in the future offer additional shares of HEI’s Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for HEI Common Stock at prices that may not be the same as the current market price per share, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which the Company may sell additional shares of HEI Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into HEI Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the current market price per share of HEI Common Stock.\nIn addition, any future sales of a substantial number of shares of HEI Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of HEI Common Stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of those shares of Common Stock, or the perception that those shares may be sold, will have on the market price of HEI Common Stock. Further, we may not have the ability to raise the amount of capital necessary on reasonable terms, or at all, to fund our contribution to the Maui wildfire tort litigation settlement, and uncertainties about the Company’s access to capital could have a material adverse effect on the market price of HEI Common Stock.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company does not currently intend to pay dividends on HEI Common Stock and currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of the Company’s business. In addition, the terms of certain existing and any future debt agreements may preclude the Company from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of HEI Common Stock may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nTax Legislation Risk—Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense. Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nGeographic Concentration Risk—The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than that of many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including, in particular, extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.\nCompetitive and Technological Risk—Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  Certain aspects of the electric utility industry are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:\n•The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. \nCybersecurity Risk—The Company is subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could materially and adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data, ransomware demands or disruptions to operations. In addition, there is increasing cybersecurity risk associated with the broad adoption of a remote working environment. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately \nrespond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nUtilities. The Utilities rely on evolving and complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, nation-state threat actors, criminal organizations, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.\nPrivate and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyberattacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to unforeseen operational/cybersecurity risks due to the reliance on legacy operational components or modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties, such as independent power producers, distributed energy resource aggregators and customers. Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. The Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel; however, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utilities maintain cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utilities believe are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ operational technologies or networks were to malfunction or fail or cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.\nDue to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, experience supply chain compromises or other internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include the implementation of new systems and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions, which may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, or the failure to realize the benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.\nThe Utilities’ disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nUninsured Losses—HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or have limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly \nestimated at $13 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.\nRelated to damages and costs incurred as a result of the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Company has property insurance with a total policy limit of $500 million, subject to a $1 million retention, for wildfire damages related to Utility-owned non-generating assets, including overhead transmission and distribution assets within 1,000 feet of such assets. The Company also has $165 million of excess liability insurance and $25 million of miscellaneous professional liability insurance for third party claims, including claims related to wildfires, with a retention of $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and $145 million directors and officers liability insurance to cover claims related to shareholder and derivative lawsuits, with a retention of $1.0 million. The aggregate damages and costs associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires could significantly exceed the Company’s policy limits.\nEnvironmental Regulation—Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.\nIf HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. \nElectric utility risks.\n    The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nRegulatory Risk—Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, rate reductions or refunds or unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. On December 23, 2020, as part of the D&O establishing the PBR Framework, the PUC established a five-year Multi-year Rate Period (MRP) during which there will be no general rate cases. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. The PUC is currently evaluating the Utilities’ proposal to rebase the rates in the form of a tri-company rate case with a 2026 test year.\nAny adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates at the end of the MRP, including the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, the denial of exceptional project recovery applications during the MRP, adverse impact of adjustments made to the PBR Framework, decisions on recovery of exogenous items under the PBR Framework, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTo improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms, including an ECRC (includes a PUC-ordered 98%/2% risk-sharing split between customers and the Utilities for fossil fuel price variations from baseline prices, with a current annual aggregate exposure cap of +/- $3.7 million), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, an exceptional project recovery mechanism (EPRM) (formerly Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism), and a Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.\nUnder the PBR Framework, the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment (ARA) includes a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in the 2020 test year rate case. The ability of the Utilities to recover increasing costs and earn a reasonable return on capital investments not covered by the ARA or not achieving the customer dividend and cost savings commitment could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Under the PBR Framework, the existing PIMs continue, and the PUC established new PIMs and is working on additional PIMs with stakeholders. The assessment of penalties for not achieving performance goals or the failure to achieve PIMs rewards could affect the Utilities’ ability to achieve their allowed ROACEs and have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. \nRelated to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Utilities obtained PUC approval to defer certain non-labor expenses incurred from August 8, 2023 through December 31, 2025 that are not already a part of base rates. If the PUC denies recovery of any deferred costs, such costs would be charged to expense in the period that those costs are no longer considered probable of recovery. Additionally, on August 31, 2023, the PUC issued an order temporarily suspending the ESM until further notice. The intent of the order is to address the unintended consequence of customers potentially bearing the costs associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires through the operation of the ESM without prior PUC review. See “Performance-based regulation framework” and “Regulatory assets for Maui windstorm and wildfires related costs” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBased on the current operations of the Utilities and regulatory framework, including the impact of the approved PBR Framework, the Utilities continue to follow regulatory accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met, including achieved financial results that support the recovery of costs. If events or circumstances should change, such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $227 million as of December 31, 2024), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $1,218 million as of December 31, 2024), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. See “Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.\nMany public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. In addition, as the Utilities may retire fossil fuel generating units before the full recovery of its investment, if the PUC disallows cost recovery of the undepreciated cost, the write-offs of such amounts could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ results of operations.\nWeather Conditions Risk—Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions and natural disasters.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly impact the demand for electricity. Additionally, severe weather and natural disasters may become more intense and/or frequent because of global climate changes. Recent natural disasters such as the Kilauea eruption in 2018, Mauna Loa eruption in 2022, and the Maui windstorm and wildfires in 2023, have disrupted electric utility operations. These types of events can cause outages, property damage and result in significant additional expenses that may not always be recoverable.\nClimate Change Risk—Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to cause sea level rise, which could impact coastal and low-lying areas where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is located. Potential consequences include erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables \nand increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. Climate change may also intensify extreme weather conditions including floods, hurricanes, heat waves and drought which could increase wildfire risk. These factors along with changes in sea levels, water availability and water quality have the potential to materially and adversely affect the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. \nThird Party Performance Risk—Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 75% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2024 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 40% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity, affect the Utilities’ maintenance schedules that could affect future reliability and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.\nCapacity Risk—The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies and other unplanned events. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations. \nThe Energy Reserve Margin, the planning criteria used to determine generation adequacy, is the percentage which the system generation capacity must exceed the system load in each hour. The Utilities’ Energy Reserve Margin is satisfied from 2025 through 2029 with the addition of planned generation and storage resource additions for all islands except for Hawaii Island and Lanai, which forecasts are near or slightly below target levels by less than one percent for 2025. The Utilities have plans to address these issues through managing maintenance schedules of existing generations, and if necessary, may request for voluntary customer conservation during periods of high power demands. The environment for resource planning has increased in complexity and uncertainty and the Utilities will continue using a portfolio approach to meet its obligation to serve. This includes increased renewable energy, energy storage, and other potential options, both supply side and customer programs. If the Utilities are unable to meet customer energy requirements, it could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations.\nStakeholder Activism Risk—Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS and other climate related goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income and negatively impact its financial condition and liquidity. \nOperational Risk—Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses, increased power purchase costs, and decreased reliability.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output, efficiency levels, and reliability. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error, adverse weather or environmental conditions and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, lava flows, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.\nLegislative Risk—The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation, executive orders or administrative actions.  The Utilities operations are subject to regulations under a wide variety of federal and state regulations and policies. Changes to \nfederal and state laws, rules, regulations and policies are continuous and ongoing and the federal administration, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and state administrations may enact and implement new laws, regulations and policies that could adversely and materially affect us. The new federal administration has indicated its intent to implement material changes to the federal government’s structure and operations and to advocate material changes to federal laws, regulations and policies. The Utilities cannot predict future changes in laws,regulations and policies, how they will be implemented and interpreted, or the ultimate effect that this changing environment will have on us. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The federal and state executive branches, Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.\nRenewable Portfolio Standards law.  The 2001 Hawaii Legislature adopted a law requiring the Utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard, which has been amended over the years. The most recent amendment to Hawaii’s RPS law occurred in July 2022, which former Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. The change in the definition is to be applied prospectively to future milestone measurements and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 and 2020 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every megawatt-hour (MWh) that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.\nRenewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.\nExecutive orders. In January 2025, President Trump issued multiple Executive Orders (EOs) that impact both IIJA and IRA funding. EO 14154 entitled Unleashing American Energy ordered to immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated through IIJA and IRA grants, which is causing delays in processing the Utilities’ requests for reimbursement for the Resilience Program and may potentially lead to project delays and economic uncertainty. The EO entitled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing resulted in the federal contracting officer ordering recipients to cease all diversity, equity and inclusion and community benefits plan activities funded by federal grants as of January 28, 2025, which could potentially impact the Utilities’ existing community benefits agreements with some third parties and commitments included in the Resilience Program project costs. The Utilities are unable to predict the timing or amount of the funding the Utilities may receive as a result of the two EOs mentioned above.\nGlobal climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. \nHawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 269-6(b) requires that “in making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs pertaining to electric or gas utility system capital improvements and operations, the PUC shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the state’s reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.” Based on HRS § 269-6(b) and recent case law discussing the scope of this section, the Utilities are performing GHG analyses to quantitatively or qualitatively describe the GHG emissions of proposed projects that are submitted to the PUC for approval. On June 20, 2024, House Bill 2390 was signed into law as Act 54 and took effect on July 1, 2024. Act 54 authorizes the PUC to waive a lifecycle GHG analysis for energy projects that do not involve combustion. On September 18, 2024, the PUC approved the Utilities’ waiver requests for the Stage 3 solar plus storage and wind projects.\nIn June 2018, House Bill 2182 was signed into law as Act 15 and took effect on July 1, 2018. Among its provisions, Act 15 aligned the state’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts with climate initiative goals and established a statewide carbon \nneutral goal by 2045. Under this Act, efforts would be made to “sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the state as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.” The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, administratively placed under the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, was charged with endeavoring to achieve the target, and giving consideration to the impact of its plans, decisions and strategies on the state’s ability to attain the goal. The general functions, duties and powers of the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission are set forth in HRS § 225P-3. To achieve its mandates, the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission may recommend plans, decisions and strategies that could have an impact on various entities including the Utilities. In July 2022, House Bill 1800 was signed into law as Act 238 and took effect on July 1, 2022. The Act established a goal for the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit to be at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nThe Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. In November 2021, the Utilities committed to a 70% reduction in power generation GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline and achievement of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045. While the reduction is not mandated by law, the Utilities could suffer reputational harm if it fails to achieve its commitments, which may negatively impact its business. Since the time the 2030 goal was established, delays and cancellations in the commercial operation of new renewable third-party generation resources and higher costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, as well as federal policies related to solar panel imports, have slowed the pace of progress toward reducing GHG emissions. The downgrade of Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings after the Maui windstorm and wildfires is anticipated to be an additional impediment to completion of new renewable energy and storage projects. As a result of these challenges, the Utilities expect the planned 70% reduction in carbon emissions to be achieved later than the original 2030 target date. However, the Utilities will continue to replace significant amounts of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy between now and 2030 and expect to meet or exceed the State of Hawaii’s RPS goals.\nThe foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed, such as potential carbon “cap and trade” legislation that, if applicable, may fundamentally alter costs to produce electricity and accelerate the move to renewable generation, present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.\nRenewable Transition Risk—The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and other climate related goals. The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS and other climate related goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the potential delay by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) in considering (and potential disapproval of actual or proposed) renewable energy proposals and related costs; (2) the dependence on outside parties, such as the state, developers and third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP delays or fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS and other climate related goals, eligibility for performance incentive mechanisms associated with the speed of increasing renewable generation, the ability to retire fossil fuel units, and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (3) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (4) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (5) the inability to recover the undepreciated cost of fossil fuel generating units if they are required to be retired before the end of their expected useful life; (6) uncertainties surrounding current and future renewable technologies, such as solar power, wind power, biofuels, battery storage, hydro, hydrogen, as well as related environmental assessments required to meet RPS and other climate related goals; (7) the impacts of implementation of the renewable energy proposals on future costs of electricity and potential penalties imposed by the PUC for delays in the commercial operations of renewable energy projects; (8) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; (9) the imputed debt related to the pending renewable power purchase agreements under the stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 and other RFPs could result in a credit rating downgrade for the Utilities and the Company; and (10) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.",
