      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nNeurocrine Biosciences is a neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options. We are dedicated to discovering and developing life-changing treatments for patients with under-addressed neuropsychiatric, neurological, and neuroendocrine disorders.\nOur portfolio of products includes U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, chorea associated with Huntington's disease, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and endometriosis and uterine fibroids in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie). In addition, we have a diversified portfolio of multiple compounds in mid- to late-phase development across our core therapeutic areas and an expanding early-phase pipeline that includes a range of modalities including small molecules, peptides, proteins, antibodies, and gene therapy.\nWe launched INGREZZA® (valbenazine) in the U.S. as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in May 2017 and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease in August 2023 and launched CRENESSITYTM (crinecerfont) in the U.S. as a first-in-class FDA-approved treatment of CAH in December 2024.\nWe estimate that tardive dyskinesia affects approximately 800,000 people in the U.S., that approximately 90% of the 40,000 people in the U.S. affected by Huntington’s disease will develop chorea, and that CAH affects approximately 30,000 people in the U.S. Key elements of our commercial strategy include maximizing the opportunities in INGREZZA and CRENESSITY through consistent and effective commercial execution, continued development of valbenazine as the best-in-class treatment for new patient populations, and to lead the evolving understanding of VMAT2 biology and its role in disease. INGREZZA net product sales totaled $2.3 billion for 2024, $1.8 billion for 2023, and $1.4 billion for 2022 and accounted for substantially all of our total net product sales during each of these years.\nOur partner Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) launched DYSVAL® (valbenazine) in Japan for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in June 2022 and subsequently in other select Asian markets, where it is marketed as REMLEAS® (valbenazine). We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on MTPC net sales of valbenazine.\nOur partner AbbVie launched ORILISSA® (elagolix tablets) in the U.S. for the treatment of endometriosis in August 2018 and ORIAHNN® (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules and elagolix capsules) in the U.S. for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in June 2020. We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on AbbVie net sales of elagolix.\nCommercial Products\n\nProduct                                            Indication                                                     Major Markets     \nTardive Dyskinesia                                                   U.S., Japan, Select Asian Markets (1)     \nChorea Associated with Huntington’s Disease                       \nClassic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia                               U.S.                                      \nEndometriosis                                                        U.S. (4)                                  \nUterine Fibroids                                                     U.S. (4)                                  \nAdrenal Insufficiency                                                U.S., United Kingdom, EU4 (2) (3)         \nClassic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia                               United Kingdom, EU4 (3)                   \n(1) INGREZZA is marketed as DYSVAL® (valbenazine) in Japan and REMLEAS® (valbenazine) in other select Asian markets, where MTPC retains commercialization rights.\n(2) ALKINDI is marketed as ALKINDI SPRINKLE® (hydrocortisone) in the U.S., where Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. retains commercialization rights.\n(3) The EU4 market is made up of the following countries: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.\n(4) AbbVie retains global commercialization rights to elagolix.\n![alt  graphic.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914475/000091447525000037/nbix-20241231_g7.jpg)\n![alt  graphic.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914475/000091447525000037/nbix-20241231_g8.jpg)\nCommercial Operations\nOur specialty sales force consists of approximately 600 experienced sales professionals located in the U.S. and is divided into four dedicated sales teams focused on psychiatry, neurology, long-term care, and rare diseases.\nWe sell INGREZZA in the U.S. principally to a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers, wholesale distributors, and specialty distributors. In addition, we sell CRENESSITY in the U.S. to a specialty pharmacy provider.\nManufacturing and Supply\nWe currently rely on, and intend to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers for the production of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, and our product candidates. Raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), and other supplies required for the production of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, and our product candidates are sourced from various third-party manufacturers and suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuing adequate supply of such raw materials and API is assured through long-term commercial supply and manufacturing agreements with multiple manufacturers and a continued focus on the expansion and diversification of our third-party manufacturing relationships.\nWe believe our outsourced manufacturing strategy enables us to direct our financial resources to the maximization of our opportunity with INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, investment in our internal research and development programs, and expansion of our clinical pipeline through business development opportunities.\nOur third-party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers may be subject to routine current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. We depend on our third-party partners and our quality system oversight of them for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.\nClinical Development Programs\nThe following chart summarizes our clinical development programs\n_________________________\n *  Initiating Phase 1 clinical study in the first quarter of 2025\nNeuropsychiatry\nValbenazine \nValbenazine is a highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor. VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control.\nWe have ongoing the JourneyTM study, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine when administered orally once daily as adjunctive treatment in adolescents and adults with schizophrenia who have had an inadequate response to antipsychotics. Schizophrenia is a serious and complex syndrome with heterogeneous symptoms. The World Health Organization estimates that the disorder impacts more than 20 million people worldwide. Annual associated costs for schizophrenia are estimated to be more than $150 billion in the U.S. As one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, it often results in significant emotional and functional burden for those who experience symptoms, as well as their family and friends. This chronic and disabling mental health condition is thought to result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. Traditional treatment approaches for schizophrenia rely on the use of antipsychotic medications that can lead to considerable short- and long-term health impacts.\nOsavampator (formerly NBI-1065845) \nOsavampator is a potential first-in-class alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in development for patients with inadequate response to treatment of major depressive disorder. We originally acquired the global rights to osavampator in June 2020 as a 50:50 profit-share product from Takeda. In January 2025, we agreed with Takeda to convert from sharing operating profits and losses with respect to the development and commercialization of osavampator to a royalty-bearing license. Pursuant to the license, we have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize osavampator for all indications in all territories worldwide, excluding Japan.\nIn April 2024, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2 SAVITRI™ study of osavampator in adults with major depressive disorder. The Phase 2 dose-finding study met its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating that once-daily, oral administration of NBI-1065845 produced a statistically significant change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at both Day 28 (primary, p=0.0159) and Day 56 (secondary, p=0.0016).\nWe have an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osavampator in adults with major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a persistently depressed mood, loss of interest, lack of enjoyment in daily activities, poor concentration, and decreased energy. Major depressive disorder is one of the leading causes of disability. Approximately 21 million people in the U.S. live with major depressive disorder. It is estimated that roughly one-third of people living with major depressive disorder do not respond to available antidepressants.\nNBI-1117568\nNBI-1117568 is a first-in-class, orally active, highly selective investigational M4 agonist in development as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. As a selective M4 orthosteric agonist, NBI-1117568 offers the potential for a novel mechanism with an improved safety profile without the need of combination therapy to minimize off-target pharmacology-related side effects, while also not being dependent on the presence of acetylcholine for efficacy. Muscarinic receptors are central to brain function and validated as drug targets in psychosis and cognitive disorders. We acquired the global rights to NBI-1117568, excluding in Japan, from Nxera in 2021.\nIn August 2024, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2 clinical study of NBI-1117568 in adults with schizophrenia. The Phase 2 dose-finding study met its primary endpoint for the once-daily 20 mg dose, demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6 (p=0.011 and effect size of 0.61). The once-daily 20 mg dose also demonstrated statistically significant improvement for additional endpoints, including improvement in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scale, Marder Factor Score – Positive Symptom Change, and Marder Factor Score - Negative Symptom Change. We expect to advance NBI-1117568 into Phase 3 development in the first half of 2025.\nNBI-1070770\nNBI-1070770 is a novel, selective, and orally active, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of the NR2B subunit-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA NR2B) receptor in development as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder. We acquired the global rights to NBI-1070770 from Takeda in 2020.\nWe have an ongoing Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NBI-1070770 in adults with major depressive disorder.\nOther Early-Stage Neuropsychiatry Programs\nWe have ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human clinical studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of investigational compounds NBI-1117570, NBI-1117567, NBI-1117569, and NBI-1065890 in healthy adult participants.\nNBI-1117570, NBI-1117567 (M1 preferring), and NBI-1117569 (M4 preferring) are investigational, oral, muscarinic M1/M4 agonists being developed for the potential treatment of certain neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We acquired the global rights NBI-1117570, NBI-1117567, and NBI-1117569 from Nxera in 2021.\nNBI-1065890 is an investigational, oral, selective VMAT2 inhibitor for the potential treatment of certain neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. NBI-1065890 was discovered and is being developed internally at Neurocrine Biosciences.\nNeurology\nValbenazine\nWe have an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine for the treatment of dyskinetic cerebral palsy in pediatrics and adults. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is a non-progressive, permanent disorder marked by involuntary movement and is a result of damage to the fetal or infant brain’s basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in involuntary and abnormal movements. It affects development and movement and has long term effects on patients’ quality of life. The long-term outlook for patients with dyskinetic cerebral palsy will depend upon the severity of the brain damage and how well the treatment works. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy affects up to 15% of the estimated 500,000 to 1 million people affected by cerebral palsy in the U.S.\nNBI-1076986\nNBI-1076986 is an investigational, oral, muscarinic M4 selective acetylcholine antagonist for the potential treatment of certain movement disorders. NBI-1076986 was discovered and is being developed internally at Neurocrine Biosciences.\nWe have an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of investigational compound NBI-1076986 in healthy adult participants.\nIntellectual Property\nWe actively seek to protect our products, product candidates, and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business. We own a portfolio of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications, and have also licensed rights to a number of U.S. and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, uses to treat particular conditions, methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles, and methods of manufacturing.\nBelow is a description of the U.S. and ex-U.S. patents to INGREZZA and CRENESSITY:\n•INGREZZA, our highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor approved in the U.S. for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, is covered by 22 issued, FDA Orange Book-listed U.S. patents which are set to expire between 2027 and 2040. Patent term extension corresponding to regulatory approval delay of 552 days has been received for U.S. Patent No. 8,039,627, which now expires in 2031 and covers valbenazine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient contained in INGREZZA. In 2023, we entered into settlement agreements resolving all patent litigation brought by us against the companies that filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of INGREZZA, and all cases have been dismissed. Pursuant to the terms of the respective settlement agreements, such companies have the right to sell generic versions of INGREZZA in the U.S. beginning March 1, 2038, or earlier under certain circumstances.\n•CRENESSITY, a CRF1 receptor antagonist approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CAH in adults and children, is covered by U.S. patents among other patents set to expire between 2035 and 2041 (not including any potential patent term extensions), and pending patent applications, which, if issued, could expire at least as late as 2045.\nWe also own, or have licensed rights to, patents covering our other products and earlier stage product candidates. In addition to the potential patent term extensions referenced above, the products and product candidates in our pipeline may be subject to additional terms of exclusivity that we may obtain by future patent issuances.\nSeparately, the U.S., the EU, and Japan each provide data and marketing exclusivity for new medicinal compounds. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the original applicant’s data as the basis of a generic marketing application during the period of data and marketing exclusivity, which is measured from the date of marketing approval by the FDA or corresponding foreign regulatory authority. This period of exclusivity is generally five years in the U.S., six years in Japan and eight years in the EU, with marketing exclusivity lasting an additional two years in the EU, except that for biologics, the period of exclusivity in the U.S. is 12 years under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. In addition, if granted orphan drug designation, certain of our product candidates, including, for example, crinecerfont, may also be eligible for marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years and EU for 10 years.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the challenges we may face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our legal proceedings related to intellectual property matters.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our products and product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nCompetition may also arise from, among other things, other drug development technologies, methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines, and new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. Such developments by others (including the development of generic equivalents) may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\n•INGREZZA competes with AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine), marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. A once-daily dosing of AUSTEDO (AUSTEDO XR) was introduced in February 2023. Additionally, there are a number of commercially available medicines used to treat tardive dyskinesia off-label, such as XENAZINE® (tetrabenazine) and generic equivalents, and various antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), anticholinergics, benzodiazepines (off-label), and botulinum toxin. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting Huntington's disease.\n•CRENESSITY competes with high dose corticosteroid monotherapy which is the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone levels for patients with CAH. In the U.S. alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting CAH.\n•Our investigational treatments for potential use in schizophrenia and depression may in the future compete with several development-stage programs being pursued by other companies. In addition, there are a number of different anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications currently used in these patient populations.\n•Our investigational treatments for potential use in neurology, neuroendocrinology and neuropsychiatry may in the future compete with numerous approved products and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies.\nCollaboration and License Agreements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our significant collaboration and license agreements.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. and other countries. Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution, tracking, marketing and sale of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.\nIn addition, federal and state healthcare laws, and equivalent supranational and foreign laws, restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws and industry codes of conduct regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. We have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure our business practices remain compliant.\nThe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and equivalent foreign laws makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under programs such as a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid in the U.S.\nFederal and equivalent foreign civil and criminal false claims laws and the federal civil monetary penalties law and equivalent foreign laws, which prohibit among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or to avoid or decrease an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services and equivalent foreign laws.\nWe may be subject to HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their privacy and security regulations, which impose certain obligations, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information on covered entities subject to HIPAA (i.e., health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers) and their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nAlso, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK) or in EU member states, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In addition to these anti-corruption laws, we are subject to import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and regulatory limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets.\nFailure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and equivalent foreign healthcare programs, and additional reporting requirements and regulatory oversight, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nDevelopment and Marketing Approval for Products \nPreclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an investigational new drug application (IND) and to equivalent foreign authorities before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly multi-phase process.\n\nPhase 1        Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the product in human volunteers or in patients with the target disease.                                                                                                  \nPhase 2        Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety.                                                                                                                                                   \nPhase 3        Larger, multi-center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA, the European Commission, or equivalent foreign authorities, to market a product candidate for a specific disease.     \nThe FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Institutional Review Boards, Institutional Ethics Committees and Data Safety Monitoring Boards also closely monitor the conduct of our trials and may also place holds on our clinical trials or recommend that we voluntarily do so. Clinical trials conducted in foreign countries are also subject to oversight by regulatory authorities in those countries.\nOnce Phase 3 trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a new drug application (NDA) for approval to commence commercial sales. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has a goal of 10 months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. The FDA generally has a six-month review goal of priority NDAs.\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or supplements to an application must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.\nThe FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or additional elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.\nThe FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.\nThe FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\nBefore approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements.\nAfter evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.\nEven if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.\nWe will also have to complete an approval process similar to that in the U.S. in order to commercialize our product candidates in each foreign country. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S., except for a certain limited number of drugs sold to certain Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2023. The resulting prices may not be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our corporate collaborators.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the U.S. will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.\nIf the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nDrugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.\nThe FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things:\n•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indication(s) and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting pre-approval promotion of investigational drugs, as well as the promotion of off-label uses of approved drugs, and a company may be subject to significant liability. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.\nReimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.\nIn the U.S., third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the U.S., and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drug products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained in the first instance or applied consistently.\nThird-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety, efficacy and clinical appropriateness. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our products or product candidates, including INGREZZA, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.\nMoreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nThe marketability of any product or product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nHealthcare Reform Measures\nThe U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry and the cost of prescription drugs has been a continuous focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nMost recently, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, which, among other things, (1) directs the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, (2) redesigns the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to lower patient out-of-pocket costs and increase manufacturer liability and (3) requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in the ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025 and eliminated the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost to $2,000 through a newly established manufacturer discount program. These provisions took effect progressively starting in 2023. On August 15, 2024, HHS announced the negotiated prices of the first 10 drugs that were subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. On January 17, 2025, HHS announced its selection of fifteen additional drugs covered under Part D for negotiation in 2025 (for initial price applicability year 2027). Certain high-expenditure Part B and Part D drugs/biologics will be selected for negotiation in 2026 (for initial price applicability year 2028) and annually thereafter. AUSTEDO and AUSTEDO XR, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, have been selected for the Medicare drug negotiation program in 2025 (for initial price applicability year 2027). If the negotiation program results in a decrease in the price of AUSTEDO or AUSTEDO XR, it may result in increased competitive pressure on INGREZZA. The overall impact of any potential negotiated priced reduction of AUSTEDO or AUSTEDO XR on INGREZZA revenues is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.\nWhile the Medicare drug negotiation program targets high-expenditure drugs/biologics that have been on the market for several years without generic or biosimilar competition, we were notified in January 2025 that INGREZZA qualifies for the small biotech exception, which provides an exemption from selection for price negotiation until 2027 (for initial price applicability year 2029, pursuant to which negotiated pricing would go into effect, if selected).\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented those provisions of the IRA establishing a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program. Under this discount program and subject to certain exceptions, manufacturers must give a 10 percent discount on Part D program drugs in the initial coverage phase, and a 20 percent discount on Part D drugs when the beneficiary enters the catastrophic coverage phase (the phase after the patient incurs costs above the initial phase out-of-pocket threshold, which is $2,000). However, the IRA allows the 10 and 20 percent discounts to be phased in over a multi-year period for “specified manufacturers” and “specified small manufacturers”. During this phase-in period, such manufacturers would pay a lower percentage discount on Medicare Part D program drugs. In April 2024, the Company was notified by CMS that it qualified as a “specified small manufacturer” and will receive the discount phase-in discussed above for INGREZZA. INGREZZA is reimbursed under Medicare Part D, and increased discounts could impact INGREZZA revenues, while also having an industry-wide impact on the cost of other Part D program drugs such as AUSTEDO and AUSTEDO XR. The overall impact on INGREZZA revenues is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and we are still evaluating the potential impact of this discount program and our designation as a “specified small manufacturer.”\nOur designation as a “specified small manufacturer” under the new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program and INGREZZA’s qualification for the small biotech exception for purposes of the Medicare drug price negotiation program are subject to various requirements and there is no assurance that we will continue to qualify for these exemptions in the future. The loss or potential loss of these exemptions, including as a result of a third party acquiring us, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe most significant prior revisions to federal law governing the pharmaceutical industry and prescription drug pricing were enacted through the March 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA). This law was intended to broaden access to health insurance by reducing the number of uninsured persons, reducing or constraining the growth of healthcare spending, enhancing remedies against fraud and abuse, adding transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, imposing taxes and fees on the health industry and imposing additional health policy reforms. \nWe expect that these health reform measures may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement for prescription drugs, as well as result in additional downward pressure on any price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payors. \nOther significant legislative changes impacting the pharmaceutical industry and prescription drug pricing have been adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2032.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to examine and/or control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s Section 804 Importation Program (SIP) proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the U.S. or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. Further, certain states through legislation have created a state prescription drug affordability board (PDAB) to help control costs of drugs for that state. The functions of the PDABs vary by state, and may include among others, negotiating the price the state pays for certain drugs, recommending or setting upper limits on drug prices, performing drug affordability reviews, and advising state lawmakers on additional ways to reduce the state’s drug spending. It is possible that the actions taken by the PDABs may result in lower prices for certain drug products sold in their states.\nProposed Healthcare Reform Measures\nThe U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and may be significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nWe are currently unable to predict what other additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry may be enacted in the future or what effect recently enacted federal legislation or any such additional legislation or regulation would have on our business, particularly in light of the recent U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections.\nRegulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the EU\nTo market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can initiate clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally aligns with the requirements in the U.S. It entails satisfactory completion of pharmaceutical development, nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed indication. \nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement may vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP and in a GMP licensed facility, which can be subject to GMP inspections.\nClinical Trials in the EU\nIn the EU, the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR) entered into application on January 31, 2022 and became effective for all clinical trials on January 31, 2025, repealing and replacing the former Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20 (CTD). The regulation introduces a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”, the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors. A harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials has been introduced and is divided into two parts. \nMarketing Authorizations\nIn the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization (MA) has been granted. To obtain an MA for a product in the EU, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by the competent authorities of EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). An MA may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. \nThe centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission that is valid throughout the European Economic Area (which is comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) products designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), and (iv) products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, authorization through the centralized procedure is optional on related approval. \nAccelerated assessment may be granted by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product targeting an unmet medical need is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops). The CHMP can, however, revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. \nAn MA has, in principle, an initial validity of five years. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State in which the original MA was granted. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year renewal period for the MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (for a centralized MA) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). \nUpon receiving an MA, innovative medicinal products are generally entitled to receive eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year period may, occasionally, be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. \nOrphan Designation and related Exclusivity in the EU\nIn the EU, Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that: (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (ii) either (a) such conditions affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU, or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.\nUpon grant of a marketing authorization, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that the EMA cannot accept another marketing authorization application or accept an application to extend for a similar product and the European Commission cannot grant a marketing authorization for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed PIP. The period of market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria on the basis of which it received orphan medicinal product destination.\nPost-Authorization Obligations in the EU\nWhere an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Similar to the U.S., both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).\nIn the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both EU and EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. General requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products, such as direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicinal products are established in EU law. However, the details are governed by regulations in individual EU Member States and can differ from one country to another.\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the UK\nThe UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has changed the regulatory relationship between the UK and the EU. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is now the UK’s standalone regulator for medicinal products and medical devices. Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is now a third country to the EU. Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU regulatory rules. \nThe UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is governed by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, as amended, which is derived from the CTD, as implemented into UK national law through secondary legislation. In October 2023, the MHRA announced a new Notification Scheme for clinical trials which enables a more streamlined and risk-proportionate approach to initial clinical trial applications for Phase 4 and low-risk Phase 3 clinical trial applications.\nMarketing authorizations in the UK are governed by the Human Medicines Regulations (SI 2012/1916), as amended. This legislation includes procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment route, a rolling review procedure and the International Recognition Procedures (IRP) which entered into application on January 1, 2024. Since January 1, 2024, the MHRA may rely on the IRP when reviewing certain types of marketing authorization applications. There is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation for medicinal products in the UK. Instead, the MHRA reviews applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding marketing authorization application. The criteria are essentially the same as those in the EU but have been tailored for the market.\nHuman Capital\nOur Employees\nWe have grown to a team of approximately 1,800 employees as of December 31, 2024, primarily employed in the U.S. Our highly qualified and experienced team, which includes scientists, physicians, and professionals across sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance, and other essential functions are critical to our success. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business needs. During 2024, we added more than 400 new employees to our team.\nWe expect to add additional employees in 2025 with a focus on expanding our research and development organization. We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and balance in-house with external expertise and capacity. Currently, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers.\nOur Culture\nThe success of our human capital management investments is evidenced by our low employee turnover, a number which is regularly reviewed by our Board of Directors as part of their oversight of our human capital strategy. In recognition of our efforts, in 2024, we were ranked #7 in Fortune Best Workplaces in BiopharmaTM and named Company of the Year: Specialty Pharma/Biotech in the PM360 Trailblazer Awards.\nEmployee Engagement, Talent Development & Benefits\nWe believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare, retirement planning and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development programs as well as offer tuition reimbursement. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMuch of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values.\nCorporate Information\nWe were originally incorporated in California in January 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in May 1996.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be harmed. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our business operations.\nSummary Risk Factors\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include:\n•We may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our product candidates if they are approved in the future.\n•We may not be able to successfully launch CRENESSITY.\n•If physicians and patients do not continue to accept INGREZZA or do not accept CRENESSITY, or our sales and marketing efforts are not effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue.\n•We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced.\n•Government and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products, or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability.\n•Because the development of our product candidates is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty, we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates.\n•Our clinical trials may be delayed for safety or other reasons, or fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\n•Enacted healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other recent legislative initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could adversely affect our business.\n•We have increased the size of our organization and will need to continue to increase the size of our organization. We may encounter difficulties with managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•We are transforming our research and development strategies to include the development of biologics, which requires substantial investment, including in personnel and facilities. We may encounter difficulties as we expand and may fail to successfully develop or commercialize our biologic product candidates, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•If we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and other employees or if any of our key senior executives discontinues his or her employment with us, it may delay our development efforts or impact our commercialization of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future.\n•Use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events.\n•We currently depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or our product candidates, could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates.\n•We currently have no manufacturing capabilities. If third-party manufacturers of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, our ability to commercialize existing products, conduct clinical trials and develop new products could be impaired and our costs may rise.\n•We depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates.\n•We license some of our core technologies and drug candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, or violate the terms of these licenses, we could lose our rights to those technologies and drug candidates or be forced to pay damages.\n•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products.\n•Our customers are concentrated and therefore the loss of a significant customer may harm our business.\n•We may need additional capital in the future. If we cannot raise additional funding, we may be unable to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts.\n•We expect to increase our expenses for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to sustain growth and profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our product candidates if they are approved in the future.\nWe launched INGREZZA in the U.S. as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in May 2017 and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease in August 2023. Our ability to produce INGREZZA revenues consistent with expectations ultimately depends on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA and secure and maintain adequate third-party reimbursement. Our experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products began with INGREZZA’s approval in 2017, when we hired our sales force and established our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, all of which are necessary to successfully commercialize our current and future products. We have continued to invest in our commercial infrastructure and distribution capabilities, including the recent expansion of our psychiatry and long-term care sales teams for INGREZZA in September 2024. While our team members and consultants have experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, we may face difficulties related to managing the rapid growth of our personnel and infrastructure, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain the personnel, systems, arrangements and capabilities necessary to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any product candidate approved by the FDA, or equivalent foreign authorities, in the future.\nWe may not be able to successfully launch CRENESSITY.\nIn December 2024, we announced FDA approval and launched CRENESSITY capsules and oral solution as an adjunctive treatment to glucocorticoid replacement to control androgens in adult and pediatric patients four years of age and older with classic CAH. We have also established our commercial team and hired our U.S. sales force for CRENESSITY. The successful commercial launch of CRENESSITY depends on the extent to which patients and physicians accept and adopt CRENESSITY as a treatment for CAH, and we do not know whether our expectations or estimates in this regard, or those of investors or securities analysts, will be accurate. Physicians may not prescribe CRENESSITY and patients may be unwilling to use CRENESSITY. In addition, patients may be unwilling to use CRENESSITY if reimbursement is not provided or reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost to the patient. CRENESSITY is a first-in-class therapy for children and adults with classic CAH and will therefore require us to expend substantial time and resources to educate physicians and other healthcare providers about the benefits of CRENESSITY. If we are unable to provide our sales force with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits of CRENESSITY, our efforts to commercialize CRENESSITY may not be successful. Further, any negative publicity related to CRENESSITY, or negative development for CRENESSITY in our post-marketing commitments or in regulatory processes in other jurisdictions, may adversely impact the potential of CRENESSITY and our commercial results. If the commercialization of CRENESSITY and future sales are less successful than anticipated by us or our investors or securities analysts, our stock price could decline and our business may be harmed.\nIf physicians and patients do not continue to accept INGREZZA or do not accept CRENESSITY, or our sales and marketing efforts are not effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue.\nThe commercial success of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY will depend upon the acceptance of these products as safe and effective by the medical community and patients.\nThe market acceptance of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY could be affected by a number of factors, including:\n•the timing of receipt of marketing approvals for additional indications;\n•the safety and efficacy of the products;\n•the pricing of these products;\n•the availability of healthcare payor coverage and adequate reimbursement for the products;\n•public perception regarding of these products;\n•the success of existing competitor products addressing our target markets or the emergence of equivalent or superior products; and\n•the cost-effectiveness of the products.\nIf the medical community, patients and payors do not continue to accept our products as being safe, effective, superior and/or cost effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our products and product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nCompetition may also arise from, among other things:\n•other drug development technologies;\n•methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and\n•new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents.\nDevelopments by others (including the development of generic equivalents) may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe are commercializing and performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several disorders, including tardive dyskinesia, chorea associated with Huntington's disease, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, pain, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and other neurology, neuroendocrinology, and neuropsychiatry-related diseases and disorders, and there are a number of competitors to our products and product candidates. If one or more of our competitors’ products or programs are successful (including the development of generic equivalents), the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated.\n•INGREZZA competes with AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine), marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. A once-daily dosing of AUSTEDO (AUSTEDO XR) was introduced in February 2023. Additionally, there are a number of commercially available medicines used to treat tardive dyskinesia off-label, such as XENAZINE® (tetrabenazine) and generic equivalents, and various antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), anticholinergics, benzodiazepines (off-label), and botulinum toxin. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting Huntington's disease.\n•CRENESSITY competes with high dose corticosteroid monotherapy which is the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone levels for patients with CAH. In the U.S. alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting CAH.\n•Our investigational treatments for potential use in schizophrenia and depression may in the future compete with several development-stage programs being pursued by other companies. In addition, there are a number of different anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications currently used in these patient populations.\n•Our investigational treatments for potential use in neurology, neuroendocrinology and neuropsychiatry may in the future compete with numerous approved products and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies.\nCompared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater:\n•capital resources;\n•sales and marketing experience;\n•research and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n•regulatory experience;\n•preclinical study and clinical testing experience;\n•manufacturing, marketing and distribution experience; and\n•production facilities.\nMoreover, increased competition in certain disorders or therapies may make it more difficult for us to recruit or enroll patients in our clinical trials for similar disorders or therapies.\nGovernment and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability. \nOur ability to continue to commercialize INGREZZA and successfully launch and commercialize CRENESSITY will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare and the price of prescription drugs through various means may impact our revenues. These payors’ efforts could decrease the price that we receive for any products we may develop and sell in the future.\nAssuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the out-of-pocket cost of our products. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available regardless of whether they are approved by the FDA for that particular use. Coverage decisions by payors for our competitors' products may also impact coverage for our products.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. In addition, communications from government officials, media outlets, and others regarding healthcare costs and pharmaceutical pricing could have a negative impact on our stock price, even if such communications do not ultimately impact coverage or reimbursement decisions for our products.\nThere may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs or indications, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. In addition, we could also be subject to amendments in our rebate agreements with pharmaceutical benefit managers that require us to pay larger rebate amounts or modify our formulary position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. For example, government authorities could make a decision that adversely impacts the status of one of our products, which could impact the eligibility and/or the amount of government reimbursement for that product. \nAs a pharmaceutical manufacturer, we are subject to various federal statutes and regulations requiring the reporting of price data and the subsequent provision of concessions to certain purchasers/payors, including state Medicaid programs. Federal agencies issue guidance to manufacturers related to the interpretation of laws and regulations, and this guidance has changed and may change or be updated over time. In interpreting these laws, regulations and guidance, manufacturers may make reasonable assumptions to fill gaps, and these reasonable assumptions may need to be updated upon issuance of additional agency guidance.\nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may be unable to successfully commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. Further, a majority of our current revenue is derived from federal healthcare program payors, including Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, changes in government reimbursement policies, government negotiation of the price of any of products, reductions in payments and/or our suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, the use of physician telehealth services has continued to increase, fueled by an unprecedented expansion of coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services across public and private insurers. The limitations that telehealth places on the ability to conduct a thorough physical examination may impact the ability of providers to screen for tardive dyskinesia or chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, leading to fewer patients being diagnosed and/or treated.\nOutside the U.S., reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. The EU provides options for EU Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, it may refuse to reimburse a product at the price set by the manufacturer or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. \nTo obtain reimbursement for our products in some European countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including those representing the larger markets. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between EU Member States. If we are unable to obtain favorable pricing and reimbursement status in EU Member States for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval, any anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for those products in the EU could be negatively affected.\nLegislators, policymakers, and payors may continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down. These measures could include limitations on the prices we would be able to charge for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the level of reimbursement available for these products from governmental authorities or third-party payors. Further, an increasing number of countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere, including in the U.S.\nBecause the development of our product candidates is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty, we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates.\nOnly a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. \nPotential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons. These reasons include the possibilities that the potential products may:\n•be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n•fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all;\n•be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties;\n•be difficult to manufacture on a large scale; or\n•be uneconomical to commercialize or fail to achieve market acceptance.\nIf any of our product candidates encounters any of these potential problems, we may never successfully market that product candidate.\nOur clinical trials may be delayed for safety or other reasons, or fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our potential products, we must subject these product candidates to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans. Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and may take years to complete and the outcomes are uncertain.\nIn connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, we face the risks that:\n•the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authority may not allow an IND or foreign equivalent filings required to initiate human clinical studies for our drug candidates or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical studies as a condition of the initiation of Phase 1 clinical studies, or additional clinical studies for progression from Phase 1 to Phase 2, or Phase 2 to Phase 3, or for NDA approval;\n•the product candidate may not prove to be effective or as effective as other competing product candidates;\n•we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects or results of required toxicology or other studies may not be acceptable to the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n•clinical trial results may not replicate the results of previous trials;\n•we or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or vary the trials;\n•the results may not be statistically significant;\n•clinical site initiation or patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower or more difficult than expected;\n•the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may not accept the data from any trial or trial site outside of the U.S.;\n•a study is compromised due to patients dropping out and not completing the trials;\n•unforeseen disruptions or delays may occur, caused by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, armed conflicts, trade restrictions or other business interruptions; and\n•regulatory requirements may change.\nThese risks and uncertainties impact all of our clinical programs and any of the clinical, regulatory or operational events described above could change our planned clinical and regulatory activities. Geopolitical tensions could also affect our ability to obtain supplies of our investigational products, which could cause delays or otherwise disrupt our clinical trials and research and development efforts. Some of our suppliers and research collaborators are located in China, exposing us to the possibility of supply disruption in the event of changes to the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of the governments of the U.S. or China. Any such changes to laws or the adoption of tariffs or other restrictions could impact our ability to contract with certain Chinese biotechnology companies, cause delays, or have other adverse effects on the development of certain of our research programs.\nIn addition, late-stage clinical trials are often conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease. During the course of treatment, these patients can die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested but which can nevertheless adversely affect clinical trial conduct, completion and results. Any failure or substantial delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates may severely harm our business.\nEven if the clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept an application for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of an application that the application is insufficient to allow approval of a product candidate. To the extent that the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities do not accept our application for review or approve our application, we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Depending on the extent of these additional trials or any other studies that might be required, approval of any applications that we submit may be significantly delayed. It is also possible that any such additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities and we may be forced to delay or abandon our applications for approval.\nWe have increased the size of our organization and will need to continue to increase the size of our organization. We may encounter difficulties with managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSince 2017, our number of full-time employees has grown from approximately 200 to 1,800 as of December 31, 2024. Although we have substantially increased the size of our organization, we may need to add additional qualified personnel and resources, especially with the recent increase in the size of our sales force. Our current infrastructure may be inadequate to support our development and commercialization efforts and expected growth. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our organization, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees and implement and expand managerial, operational and financial systems and may be costly and take time away from running other aspects of our business, including development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, we implemented a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in 2024 to streamline certain existing business, operational, and financial processes. This project has required and may continue to require investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of processes of our business, and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Any deficiencies in the design of the ERP system could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our ability to accurately maintain our books and \nrecords, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, or otherwise operate our business. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval in the future, will partially depend on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. In particular, as we commercialize INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, we will need to support the training and ongoing activities of our sales force and will likely need to continue to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. To that end, we must be able to successfully:\n•manage our development efforts effectively;\n•integrate additional management, administrative and manufacturing personnel;\n•further develop our marketing and sales organization; \n•compensate our employees on adequate terms in an increasingly competitive, inflationary market;\n•attract and retain personnel; and\n•maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks or successfully manage our operations and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals. Our failure to accomplish any of these goals could harm our financial results and prospects.\nWe are transforming our research and development strategies to include the development of biologics, which requires substantial investment, including in personnel and facilities. We may encounter difficulties as we expand and may fail to successfully develop or commercialize our biologic product candidates, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are transforming our research and development strategies to include the development of biologics, including peptides, antibodies and gene therapies. As a company, we do not have experience successfully developing and commercializing biologics and our current infrastructure may be inadequate to support the expected growth and transformation of processes, personnel, and technologies required for these new programs. We have hired employees with expertise in these modalities, but we will need to hire additional qualified personnel and expand our management, administrative, and manufacturing functions to support the research and development organization. If we are unable to identify, recruit and integrate additional employees with the requisite skills, or effectively manage our transformation activities, the development of our biologic product candidates may not be successful, or be delayed or paused indefinitely. Additionally, the manufacture of biologics is more complex than the manufacture of small molecule therapies. We may encounter delays in production and delivery of our biologic product candidates by our third-party manufacturers or other vendors, which would result in corresponding delays to our development and commercialization of such biologic candidates. In addition, the regulatory requirements in the United States and in other countries governing biologics are evolving and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change the requirements, or identify different regulatory pathways, for approval for any of our biologic candidates. As a result, we may be required to change our regulatory strategy or to modify our applications for regulatory approval, which could delay and impair our ability to complete the preclinical and clinical development and manufacture of, and obtain regulatory approval for, our biologic candidates. We have made, and expect to continue making, substantial investments in our research and development personnel and facilities, as well in external innovation to support our expansion into the development of our biologics. If any of these risks occur and we fail to successfully develop or commercialize our biologic product candidates, we may not realize a return on our investments which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and other employees or if any of our key senior executives discontinues his or her employment with us, it may delay our development efforts or impact our commercialization of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, commercial and scientific staff. The loss of any of these people could impede the achievement of our objectives, including the successful commercialization of INGREZZA, the launch of CRENESSITY, or the commercialization of any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future, along with personnel with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, is critical to our success. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, universities and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists and individuals with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. We may face particular retention challenges in light of the recent rapid growth in our personnel and infrastructure and the perceived impact of those changes upon our corporate culture. In addition, we rely on a significant number of consultants to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy and our commercialization strategy. Our consultants may have commitments to, or advisory or consulting agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOn October 11, 2024, Kevin Gorman, Ph.D., retired as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Kyle Gano, Ph.D., formerly our Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer, succeeded Dr. Gorman in the CEO role. Dr. Gano also joined our Board of Directors effective as of October 11, 2024. Dr. Gorman founded Neurocrine in 1992 and has held numerous positions across the Company, including Chief Operating Officer, Chief Business Officer, and Senior Vice President of Business Development, before being appointed CEO in 2008. Dr. Gano was appointed Neurocrine’s Chief Business Development Officer in 2011, and Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer in 2020, and is responsible for all of Neurocrine’s business and corporate development activities. Our Board of Directors worked closely with Dr. Gorman on succession planning and believes Dr. Gano and the senior leadership team are well-positioned to continue to execute our strategy. Although Dr. Gorman will continue to serve on our Board of Directors and provide strategic direction to the Company, this leadership transition may be viewed negatively by investors, our strategic partners, or other stakeholders. Further, if the transition is not managed effectively, it could disrupt our operations and impact our financial condition and results.\nUse of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events.\nAs with most pharmaceutical products, use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity (from minor adverse reactions to death) and frequency (infrequent or prevalent). Side effects or adverse events associated with the use of our products or those of our collaborators may be observed at any time, including after a product is commercialized, and reports of any such side effects or adverse events may negatively impact demand for our or our collaborators’ products or affect our or our collaborators’ ability to maintain regulatory approval for such products. Side effects or other safety issues associated with the use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could require us or our collaborators to modify or halt commercialization of these products or expose us to product liability lawsuits which will harm our business. We or our collaborators may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products which we have not planned or anticipated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators will resolve any issues related to any product related adverse events to the satisfaction of the FDA or any regulatory agency in a timely manner or ever, which could harm our business, prospects and financial condition.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or our product candidates, could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), the finished drug product and packaging in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products may encounter difficulties in production, such as difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls and validation, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, compliance with strictly enforced U.S., state and non-U.S. regulations, and disruptions or delays caused by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, armed conflicts, trade restrictions, or other business interruptions. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for the production (including API) of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY and our product candidates and for the packaging of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY. If our third-party suppliers for INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates encounter these or any other manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties, our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our suppliers fail or refuse to supply us with INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates, or their APIs for any reason, or terminate our supply agreements or do not perform as agreed, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities must approve manufacturers of the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials used in pharmaceutical products. The loss of a supplier could require us to obtain regulatory clearance and to incur validation and other costs associated with the transfer of the API or product manufacturing processes. If there are delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or if a new supplier is unable to meet FDA or a similar foreign regulatory authority’s requirements for approval, there could be a shortage of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates.\nWe currently have no manufacturing capabilities. If third-party manufacturers of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, our ability to commercialize existing products, conduct clinical trials and develop new products could be impaired and our costs may rise.\nWe have in the past utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, third-party manufacturers to produce the drug compounds we use in our clinical trials and for the commercialization of our products. We have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and do not currently have any manufacturing facilities. Establishing internal commercial manufacturing capabilities would require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to timely or successfully establish such capabilities. Consequently, we depend on, and will continue to depend on, several contract manufacturers for all production of products for development and commercial purposes, including INGREZZA and CRENESSITY. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers, we will not be able to develop or commercialize our products, including INGREZZA and CRENESSITY. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes is subject to specific FDA and equivalent foreign regulations, including current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Our third-party manufacturers might not comply with FDA or equivalent foreign regulations relating to manufacturing our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes or other regulatory requirements now or in the future. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks:\n•contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control or quality assurance, and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel or materials and ingredients necessary to conduct their operations. As a result, our contract manufacturers might not be able to meet our clinical schedules or adequately manufacture our products in commercial quantities when required;\n•switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly on acceptable terms, or at all;\n•our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store or distribute our products; and\n•drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, equivalent foreign regulatory authorities, and other agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture of our products or product candidates as a result of a failure of a third-party manufacturer to pass regulatory inspections or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, or successfully commercialize our products.\nOur current dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may reduce our profit margin, if any, on the sale of INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or our future products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates.\nWe depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. For example, we depend on AbbVie for the manufacture and commercialization of ORILISSA and ORIAHNN and for the continued development of elagolix. We collaborate with MTPC for the commercialization of DYSVAL in Japan and for the continued development and commercialization of valbenazine for movement disorders in other select Asian markets. Some of our other collaborators include Nxera Pharma UK Limited (formerly Sosei Heptares), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., and Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \nOur current and future collaborations and licenses could subject us to a number of risks, including:\n•strategic collaborators may sell, transfer or divest assets or programs related to our partnered product or product candidates; \n•we may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and management resources; \n•we may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities; \n•we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our strategic collaborators devote to the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates; \n•we may not be able to influence our strategic collaborator’s decisions regarding the development and collaboration of our partnered product and product candidates, and as a result, our collaboration partners may not pursue or prioritize the development and commercialization of those partnered products and product candidates in a manner that is in our best interest;\n•strategic collaborators may select indications or design clinical trials in a way that may be less successful than if we were doing so; \n•strategic collaborators may not conduct collaborative activities in a timely manner, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing; \n•strategic collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic collaboration arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs; \n•disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our strategic collaborators that result in delays or in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management’s attention and consumes resources; \n•strategic collaborators may experience financial difficulties; \n•strategic collaborators may not properly maintain, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; \n•we or strategic collaborators could terminate the arrangement (in whole or in part) or allow it to expire, which would delay the development and commercialization, result in disagreements or disputes or may increase the cost of developing and commercializing our products or product candidates; \n•strategic collaborators could develop, either alone or with others, products or product candidates that may compete with ours; and \n•our strategic collaborator’s decisions regarding the development and commercialization of a partnered product or product candidate within their territory(ies) could negatively impact us in the territories where we have development and commercialization rights for such product or product candidate.\nIf any of these issues arise, it may delay and/or negatively impact the development and commercialization of drug candidates and, ultimately, our generation of product revenues.\nWe license some of our core technologies and drug candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, or violate the terms of these licenses, we could lose our rights to those technologies and drug candidates or be forced to pay damages.\nWe are dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. These licenses typically subject us to various commercialization, reporting and other obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights. If we were to default on our obligations under any of our licenses, we could lose some or all of our rights to develop, market and sell products covered by these licenses. In addition, several of our collaboration and license agreements allow our licensors to terminate such agreements if we challenge the validity or enforceability of certain intellectual property rights or if we commit a material breach in whole or in part of the agreement and do not cure such breach within the agreed upon cure period. In addition, if we were to violate any of the terms of our licenses, we could become subject to damages. Likewise, if we were to lose our rights under a license to use proprietary research tools, it could adversely affect our existing collaborations or adversely affect our ability to form new collaborations. We also face the risk that our licensors could, for a number of reasons, lose patent protection or lose their rights to the technologies we have licensed, thereby impairing or extinguishing our rights under our licenses with them.\nOur customers are concentrated and therefore the loss of a significant customer may harm our business.\nWe have entered into agreements for the distribution of INGREZZA with a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and distributors. Four of these customers represented approximately 93% of our total product sales for 2024 and approximately 98% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2024. In addition, CRENESSITY is distributed by one specialty pharmacy provider. If any of our significant customers becomes subject to bankruptcy, is unable to pay us for our products or wants to terminate their relationship with us, or if we otherwise lose any of these significant customers, our revenue, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Also, we may need to enter into agreements with additional distributors or specialty pharmacy providers, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we replace the loss of a significant customer, we cannot predict with certainty that such transition would not result in a decline in our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need additional capital in the future. If we cannot raise additional funding, we may be unable to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n•the commercial success of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY;\n•the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, including advertising campaigns;\n•continued scientific progress in our R&D and clinical development programs;\n•the magnitude and complexity of our research and development programs;\n•progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n•the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n•the cost involved in filing and pursuing patent applications, enforcing patent claims, or engaging in interference proceedings or other patent litigation;\n•costs associated with securing adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products;\n•competing technological and market developments;\n•developments related to any future litigation;\n•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates; \n•the impact of pandemics or epidemics on our business; and\n•the cost of any strategic alliances, collaborations, product in-licensing, or acquisitions.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private sales of our securities, including equity securities. In addition, we have previously financed capital purchases and may continue to pursue opportunities to obtain debt financing in the future. Additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders and any debt financings may involve operating covenants that restrict our business.\nWe expect to increase our expenses for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to sustain growth and profitability.\nWe received FDA approval for INGREZZA for tardive dyskinesia in April 2017 and for chorea associated with Huntington's disease in August 2023. We received FDA approval for CRENESSITY capsules and oral solution as an adjunctive treatment to glucocorticoid replacement to control androgens in adult and pediatric patients four years of age and older with classic CAH in December 2024. Our partner AbbVie received FDA approval for ORILISSA for endometriosis in July 2018 and for ORIAHNN for uterine fibroids in May 2020. Additionally, our partner MTPC received Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approval for DYSVAL for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in March 2022. However, we have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any other product candidates. Even if we continue to succeed in commercializing INGREZZA, or are successful in commercializing CRENESSITY or any of our product candidates, we may not be able to sustain profitability. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures as we:\n•commercialize INGREZZA for tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease;\n•commercially launch CRENESSITY as an adjunctive treatment to glucocorticoid replacement to control androgens in adult and pediatric patients four years of age and older with classic CAH;\n•seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates or for additional indications for our current products;\n•develop, formulate, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates;\n•in-license or acquire new product development opportunities;\n•implement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n•hire additional clinical, scientific, sales, marketing and administrative personnel.\nWe expect to increase our expenses and other investments in the coming years as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. Thus, our future operating results and profitability may fluctuate from period to period due to the factors described above, and we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow on a sustained basis. We may not be able to generate these revenues, and we may never achieve profitability on a sustained basis in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that our prioritization determinations regarding our R&D and clinical development programs, including the acceleration or discontinuation of certain programs and product candidates, will generate their expected benefits and/or meet investor expectations. Our prioritization decisions may also adversely affect other internal programs and initiatives as well as our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel. Our failure to maintain or increase profitability on a sustained basis could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nThe independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we rely upon to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely, or may make mistakes in the conduct of our trials.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators and CROs to conduct our clinical trials under their agreements with us. The investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If our independent investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, or if their performance is substandard, or not in compliance with GCPs, it may delay or prevent the approval of our regulatory applications and our introduction of new treatments. The CROs we contract with for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our products. Moreover, these independent investigators and CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If independent investigators and CROs assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position.\nWe are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review for INGREZZA and CRENESSITY. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other post-marketing requirements and restrictions.\nRegulatory approvals for any of our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. For INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, and any product candidate that the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product is subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, advertising and promotional materials for approved products must comply with FDA regulations and those of foreign regulatory authorities and may be subject to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nFailure to comply with these ongoing regulatory requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may result in, among other things:\n•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, changes in the product’s label, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n•fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n•refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n•adverse inspection findings, enforcement actions, or other activities that temporarily delay manufacture and distribution of our products;\n•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n•product injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a sustained basis.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo overturned the longstanding Chevron doctrine, under which courts were required to give deference to regulatory agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal statutes. The Loper decision could result in additional legal challenges to regulations and guidance issued by federal agencies, including the FDA, on which we rely. Any such legal challenges, if successful, could have a material impact on our business. Additionally, the Loper decision may result in increased regulatory uncertainty, inconsistent judicial interpretations, and other impacts to the agency rulemaking process, any of which could adversely impact our business and operations. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action or as a result of legal challenges, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf the market opportunities for our products and product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our expected revenues may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nCertain of the diseases that INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, and our product candidates are being developed to address are in underserved and underdiagnosed populations. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who will seek treatment utilizing our products or product candidates, may not be accurate. If our estimates of the prevalence or number of patients potentially on therapy prove to be inaccurate, the market opportunities for INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, and our product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are, our prospects for generating expected revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nBecause our operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may decline.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our financial results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, for among other reasons, due to seasonality and timing of customer purchases and commercial sales of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, royalties from out-licensed products, the impact of Medicare Part D coverage, including redesign of the Part D benefit enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, our achievement of product development objectives and milestones, clinical trial enrollment and expenses, research and development expenses and the timing and nature of contract manufacturing, contract research payments, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, armed conflicts, trade restrictions, or other business interruptions. Because a majority of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect financial results in a quarter. Thus, our future operating results and profitability may fluctuate from period to period, and even if we become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability. Moreover, as our company and our market capitalization have grown, our financial performance has become increasingly subject to quarterly and annual comparisons with the expectations of securities analysts or investors. The failure of our financial results to meet these expectations, either in a single quarterly or annual period over a sustained period time, could cause our stock price to decline.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or our customers, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Inflation Reduction Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenses for tax purposes in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and subsequently amortize such expenses over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over 15 years for research activities conducted outside the U.S. If the requirement to amortize research and development expenditures is not repealed or otherwise modified, it will continue to have an adverse effect on our tax liability. Furthermore, our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including the implementation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting “Two-Pillar” framework, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain multinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One) and the imposition of a minimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). Certain countries in which we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, core provisions of the Pillar Two rules. We continue to evaluate and assess the potential impact of these new rules, including on our effective tax rate, and our eligibility to qualify for transition and safe harbor. Any changes in tax laws, including any new tax legislation or initiatives, could not only significantly increase our tax provision, cash tax liabilities, and effective tax rate, but could also have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time charges and ongoing compliance costs, and increase our future tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe have a multinational tax structure and are subject to income tax in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Our effective tax rate is influenced by many factors including changes in our operating structure, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries, our allocation of profits and losses among our subsidiaries, our intercompany transfer pricing agreements and rules relating to transfer pricing, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, the impact of stock-based compensation, the availability of U.S. research and development tax credits, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, changes in accounting for income taxes, and future changes in tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax liabilities including management’s judgment for uncertain tax positions. The Internal Revenue Service, other domestic taxing authorities, or foreign taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretation of tax laws as applied to our operations. Our reported effective tax rate and after-tax cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by tax assessments in excess of amounts accrued for our financial statements. This could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies historically have been highly volatile, and the market for these securities has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, the applicability of the Medicare drug price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act negatively affected investor sentiment and resulted in significant volatility. Furthermore, especially as we and our market capitalization have grown, the price of our common stock has been increasingly affected by quarterly and annual comparisons with the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts’ forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, which is based on assumptions that may be incorrect or that may change from quarter to quarter, the market price of our common stock could decline. Over the course of the last 12 months, the price of our common stock has ranged from approximately $111 per share to approximately $158 per share.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many factors, including:\n•sales of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY;\n•failure of CRENESSITY to achieve commercial success; \n•the results of our clinical trials;\n•reports of safety issues related to INGREZZA or CRENESSITY;\n•any delay in filing an IND, NDA, marketing authorization application (MAA), or other regulatory submission for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory agency's review of that IND, NDA, MAA, or other regulatory submission;\n•developments concerning new and existing collaboration agreements;\n•announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others, including our competitors;\n•general economic and market conditions, including economic and market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry;\n•developments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n•developments related to the FDA, CMS and foreign regulatory agencies;\n•government regulation, including the Inflation Reduction Act;\n•future sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n•any trading activity pursuant to a share repurchase program;\n•comments by securities analysts;\n•additions or departures of key personnel;\n•fluctuations in our operating results;\n•potential litigation matters;\n•government and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement;\n•failure of any of our product candidates to achieve commercial success even if approved;\n•disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, armed conflicts, trade restrictions, or other business interruptions; and\n•public concern as to the safety of our drugs.\nIn addition, we are a member of the S&P MidCap 400 index. If we cease to be represented in the S&P MidCap 400 index, or other indexes or indexed products, as a result of our market capitalization falling below the threshold for inclusion in the index, certain institutional shareholders may, due to their internal policies and investment guidelines, be required to sell their shareholdings. Such sales may result in further negative pressure on our stock price and, when combined with reduced trading volume and liquidity, could adversely affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares.\nThere can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn October 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock and we subsequently entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction to repurchase the entirety of this authorized amount. The purchase period for this ASR transaction ended in February 2025 and an aggregate of 2.3 million shares were delivered to us at an average repurchase price of $131.83 per share. We can provide no assurance that this or future share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value, and it may not prove to be the best use of our cash. If our Board of Directors authorizes any additional stock repurchase programs it could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in some cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and management time related to compliance activities. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, our reputation may be harmed and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability and result in harm to our business.\nOur employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. Despite our efforts to monitor social media communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products on social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in the biotechnology industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nEnacted healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other recent legislative initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare and to lower drug prices. In the U.S., comprehensive drug pricing legislation enacted by the Federal government implements, for the first time, government control over the pricing of certain prescription pharmaceuticals. Moreover, in some foreign jurisdictions, pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to government control. Additionally, other federal and state laws impose obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to disclosure of new drug products introduced to the market and increases in drug prices above a specified threshold.\nFor example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, provides for, among other things: (1) the Secretary of the HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare; (2) the redesign of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to lower patient out-of-pocket costs and increase manufacturer liability; and (3) drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in the ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025 and in 2025, eliminated the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program and creates a new, permanent cap on beneficiary out-of-pocket spending for Part D drugs, in addition to a newly established manufacturer discount program. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has issued and updated and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. These provisions took effect progressively beginning in 2023. On August 15, 2024, HHS announced the negotiated prices of the first 10 drugs that were subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. On January 17, 2025, HHS announced its selection of fifteen additional drugs covered under Part D for negotiation in 2025 (for initial price applicability year 2027). Certain high-expenditure Part B and Part D drugs/biologics will be selected for negotiation in 2026 (for initial price applicability year 2028) and annually thereafter. While the Medicare drug price negotiation program targets high-expenditure drugs/biologics that have been on the market for several years without generic or biosimilar competition, we were notified in January 2025 that INGREZZA qualifies for the small biotech exception, which provides an exemption from selection until 2027 (for initial price applicability year 2029, pursuant to which negotiated pricing would go into effect, if selected).\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented those provisions of the IRA establishing a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program. Under this discount program and subject to certain exceptions, manufacturers must give a 10 percent discount on Part D program drugs in the initial coverage phase, and a 20 percent discount on Part D drugs when the beneficiary enters the catastrophic coverage phase (the phase after the patient incurs costs above the initial phase out-of-pocket threshold, which is $2,000). However, the IRA allows the 10 and 20 percent discounts to be phased in over a multi-year period for “specified manufacturers” and “specified small manufacturers”. During this phase-in period, such manufacturers would pay a lower percentage discount on Medicare Part D program drugs. In April 2024, the Company was notified by CMS that it qualified as a “specified small manufacturer” and will receive the discount phase-in discussed above for INGREZZA. INGREZZA is reimbursed under Medicare Part D, and increased discounts could impact INGREZZA revenues, while also having an industry-wide impact on the cost of other Part D program drugs such as AUSTEDO and AUSTEDO XR, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries. The overall impact on INGREZZA revenues is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and we are still evaluating the potential impact of this discount program and our designation as a “specified small manufacturer.” \nOur designation as a “specified small manufacturer” under the new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program and INGREZZA’s qualification for the small biotech exception for purposes of the Medicare drug price negotiation program are subject to various requirements and there is no assurance that we will continue to qualify for these exemptions in the future. The loss or potential loss of these exemptions, including as a result of a third party acquiring us, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nPrior to the IRA’s enactment, the most significant recent federal legislation impacting the pharmaceutical industry occurred in March 2010, when the ACA was signed into law. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance and reduce the number of uninsured individuals, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nOther legislative changes have been adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, will remain in effect until 2032. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s SIP proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the U.S. or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. Further, certain states through legislation have created a state PDAB to help control costs of drugs for that state. The functions of the PDABs vary by state, and may include among other things, recommending or setting upper limits on the price the state pays for certain drugs, performing drug affordability reviews, and advising state lawmakers on additional ways to reduce the state’s drug spending. It is possible that the actions taken by the PDABs may result in lower prices for certain drug products sold in their states. \nThe implementation of these cost containment measures may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain sustained profitability or commercialize our drugs, particularly since the majority of our current revenue is derived from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success will depend on our ability to, among other things:\n•obtain patent protection for our products;\n•preserve our trade secrets;\n•prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and\n•operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nBecause of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development and regulatory approval processes in order to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Accordingly, we intend to seek patent protection for our proprietary technology and compounds. However, we face the risk that we may not obtain any of these patents and that the breadth of claims we obtain, if any, may not provide adequate protection of our proprietary technology or compounds. Additionally, if our employees, commercial collaborators or consultants use generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to develop our proprietary technology and compounds, it may impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our commercial collaborators, employees and consultants. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and some, but not all, of our commercial collaborators and consultants. However, if our employees, commercial collaborators or consultants breach these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by our competitors.\nIn addition, although we own a number of patents, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. We cannot assure you how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings. It is possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or that challenges will result in limitations of their coverage. Moreover, competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. In addition, potential competitors have in the past and may in the future file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of our products, or our competitors’ products, before the expiration of the patents covering our products or our competitors’ products, as applicable. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we have in the past and may in the future need to file infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent of ours or a patent of a competitor is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. Derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications (or those of our licensors) or a patent of a competitor. Litigation or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Litigation or derivation proceedings, including proceedings of a competitor, may also result in a competitor entering the marketplace faster than expected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the U.S.\nProposed healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other prospective legislative initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement additional government controls over the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. Increasing emphasis on reducing the cost of healthcare in the U.S. will continue to put pressure on the pricing and reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including the EU, have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies, as described further in the risk factor titled “Government and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability.”\nWe are currently unable to predict what other additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry may be enacted in the future or what effect recently enacted federal or equivalent foreign legislation or any such additional legislation or regulation would have on our business, particularly in light of the recent U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections. The pendency or approval of such proposals or reforms could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to enter into collaboration agreements for the further development and commercialization of our programs and products.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including without limitation, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as current and future sales, marketing, patient co-payment assistance and education programs.\nSuch laws include:\n•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n•HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n•HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates and their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n•analogous state, local and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures or drug pricing; state laws that require disclosure of price increases above certain identified thresholds as well as of new commercial launches in the state; state laws that create Prescription Drug Price Affordability Boards to review or attempt to cap drug spending; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and local “drug take back” laws and regulations; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health \ninformation in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. While our interactions with healthcare professionals, including our speaker programs and other arrangements have been structured to comply with these laws and related guidance, it is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices, business practices of our vendors or consultants, or a rogue employee’s activities, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. For example, we maintain a patient assistance program to help eligible patients afford our products. These and other types of programs have become the subject of governmental scrutiny, and numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been subject to litigation, enforcement actions and settlements related to their patient assistance programs. If our operations or activities or those of our vendors are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nAny sales of our product once commercialized outside the U.S. will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. Additionally, because of our U.S. and international operations, we are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, in the United States and internationally, including but not limited the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Recent years have seen substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations. Our business is also heavily regulated and involves significant interaction with foreign officials. In many countries outside the U.S., independent clinical investigators conducting our clinical trials and prescribers of our products are employed by government entities, and purchasers themselves can be government entities. As such, our interactions with such investigators, prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA, as well as other similar under anti-corruption laws and/or regulations enacted by other countries. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and equivalent foreign healthcare programs, and additional reporting requirements and regulatory oversight, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe could face liability if a regulatory authority determines that we are promoting INGREZZA, CRENESSITY, or any of our product candidates that receives regulatory approval, for “off-label” uses.\nA company may not promote “off-label” uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product’s FDA-approved label in the U.S. or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product may be subject to significant liability, including civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf the FDA or any other governmental agency, including equivalent foreign authorities, initiates an enforcement action against us, or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit brought by a private plaintiff on behalf of the government, and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation.\nIf our information technology systems, those third parties upon which we rely, or our data is or were compromised, we could experience adverse impacts resulting from such compromise, including, but not limited to, interruptions to our operations such as our clinical trials, claims that we breached our data protection obligations, harm to our reputation, regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, and a loss of customers or sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies and technology systems and infrastructure of third parties upon whom we rely, including CROs and other vendors, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely, collect, receive, store, process, generate, disclose, make accessible, protect, dispose of, transmit, use, safeguard, share and transfer, or collectively, process, confidential and sensitive electronic information on our networks and in our data centers. This information includes, among other things, de-identified or pseudonymous sensitive personal data (including health data), our intellectual property and proprietary information, the confidential information of our collaborators and licensees, and the personal data of our employees. It is important to our operations and business strategy that this electronic information remains secure and is perceived to be secure. \nThe size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the volume of data we retain, make such systems potentially vulnerable to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), malicious code, malware (such as malicious code, adware, and command and control (C2)), denial-of-service attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI, telecommunications failures, and other similar threats. \nCyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Such threats continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors (also referred to as APTs). Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, which could materially disrupt our systems and operations, as well as our ability to conduct clinical trials. \nRansomware attacks are also becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations (including our ability to conduct clinical trials), loss of sensitive data (including related to our clinical trials) and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. To alleviate the financial, operational and reputational impact of a ransomware attack, it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do so (including, for example, if applicable laws or regulations prohibit such payments). Similarly, supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties in our supply chain have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects, vulnerabilities, or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems and infrastructure or the information technology systems and infrastructure of third parties that support our operations. \nRemote work has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as certain of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections, computers and devices outside our premises, including at home, while in transit or in public locations.\nAdditionally, natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, terrorism, war and geopolitical conflicts, and telecommunication and electrical failures may result in damage to or the interruption or impairment of key business processes, or the loss or corruption of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal data. \nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security incidents. \nWe take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information security systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties upon which we rely). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident.\nWe rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise to operate our business, including clinical trial sites and investigators, contractors, manufacturers, suppliers and consultants. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party service providers or CROs experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or otherwise subject to a security incident. While we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.\nAlthough to our knowledge we, or the third parties upon who we rely, have not experienced a security incident or disruption to date that is material to us, we and our vendors have been, either directly or indirectly, the target of cybersecurity incidents and expect them to continue. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Furthermore, while we have implemented certain redundancies designed to avoid interruptions to our operations, not all potential events can be anticipated and interruptions to our operations could lead to decreased productivity. \nIf we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident, ransomware attack or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience material adverse consequences. Such material consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm (including but not limited to damage to our patient, partner, or employee relationships); monetary fund diversions; diversion of management’s attention; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data, loss of connectivity to our network or internet); financial loss (including decreased productivity resulting from interruptions in our operations); and other similar harms. Similarly, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information could require substantial expenditures to remedy. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may also require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\nOur contracts, with for example third parties or CROs, may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We also cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position. Additionally, our sensitive information could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees’, personnel’s, or vendors’ potential use of generative AI technologies.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or other regulatory exclusivity for some of our product candidates, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to any patent protection, we rely on forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products such as orphan drug designation. A product candidate that receives orphan drug designation can benefit from a streamlined regulatory process as well as potential commercial benefits following approval. Currently, this designation provides market exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years and EU for 10 years if a product is the first such product approved for such orphan indication. This market exclusivity does not, however, pertain to indications other than those for which the drug was specifically designated in the approval, nor does it prevent other types of drugs from receiving orphan designations or approvals in these same indications. Further, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the product is clinically superior to the orphan product or a market shortage occurs.\nIn the EU, orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria or can be lost altogether if the marketing authorization holder consents to a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug, or when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is “clinically superior” to the original orphan drug. \nIf we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. We may not be successful obtaining orphan drug designations for any indications and, even if we succeed, such product candidates with such orphan drug designations may fail to achieve FDA approval. Even if a product candidate with orphan drug designation may receive marketing approval from the FDA, it may fail to result in or maintain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, which would harm our competitive position.\nChanges in the FDA, other government agencies or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies or comparable foreign regulatory authorities on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA, other government agencies or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, including as a result of reaching the debt ceiling, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain additional capital in the future.\nThe technologies we use in our research as well as the drug targets we select may infringe the patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us or our collaborators with respect to technologies used in potential products. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators could be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party’s intellectual property unless that party grants us or our collaborators rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we could be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if our collaborators or we were able to obtain rights to the third party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.\nOur business operations may subject us to disputes, claims and lawsuits, which may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in disputes, claims and lawsuits relating to our business operations. In particular, we may face claims related to the safety of our products, intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and marketing practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. Any dispute, claim or lawsuit may divert management’s attention away from our business, we may incur significant expenses in addressing or defending any dispute, claim or lawsuit, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nLitigation related to these disputes may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations if resolved against us. In addition, the uncertainty associated with litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors, or by employees of our commercial partners could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately, to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or the trade secrets of our commercial partners, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Employee and independent contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any action against our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners or vendors for violations of these laws could result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines and imprisonment.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our insurance coverage.\nThe use of any of our potential products in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, including INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. We have product liability insurance coverage for both our clinical trials as well as related to the sale of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY in amounts consistent with customary industry practices. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability from any current or future clinical trials or approved products. A successful product liability claim, or series of claims, brought against us would decrease our cash reserves and could cause our stock price to fall. Furthermore, regardless of the eventual outcome of a product liability claim, any product liability claim against us may decrease demand for our approved products, including INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, damage our reputation, result in regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications, cause clinical trial participants to withdrawal, result in costs to defend the related litigation, decrease our revenue, and divert management’s attention from managing our business.\nOur activities involve hazardous materials, and we may be liable for any resulting contamination or injuries.\nOur research activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurs, a court may hold us liable for any resulting damages, which may harm our results of operations and cause us to use a substantial portion of our cash reserves, which would force us to seek additional financing.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and information security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we process confidential and sensitive information, including personal data, proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about clinical trial participants in connection with clinical trials, and sensitive third-party data, on our networks and in our data centers. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, orders, codes, regulations and regulatory guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal information (including clinical trial data), the number and scope of which are expanding, changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Our data processing activities may also subject us to other data privacy and security obligations, such as industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of data by us and by third parties on our behalf.\nLaws regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal data are becoming increasingly common in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. Additionally, in the past few years, numerous U.S. states—including California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah—have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, CCPA), requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices, and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA allows for fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per intentional violation). Although some U.S. comprehensive privacy laws and the CCPA exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, these laws may increase compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we may maintain about California residents. Other states have also enacted data privacy laws and we expect more jurisdictions to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts, and may increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely.\nAdditionally, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. \nLaws in Europe regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal data have also been significantly reformed and continue to undergo reform. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the UK’s GDPR (UK GDPR) (collectively, GDPR) impose strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals located, respectively, within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection similarly applies to the collection and processing of personal data, including health-related information, in Switzerland. The GDPR provides for enhanced data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, obligations relating to: processing health and other sensitive data; obtaining consent of individuals; providing notice to individuals regarding data processing activities; responding to data subject requests; taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors; notifying data subjects and regulators of data breaches; and implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR impose substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements. For example, under the GDPR, such fines can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million euros under the EU GDPR / 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, whichever is greater in either case, and also allow for private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as EU regulations governing clinical trial data and other healthcare data, could require us to change our business practices or lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation or significant penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to additional foreign data laws. For example, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and various related provincial laws, as well as Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL), may apply to our operations. As another example, the General Data Protection Law, Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), may apply to our operations. The LGPD broadly regulates processing personal data of individuals in Brazil and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to those of the EU GDPR. We also target customers in Asia and may be subject to new and emerging data privacy regimes in Asia, including Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the U.S. or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfers laws. For example, countries in the EEA and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other countries, whose privacy laws it generally believes are inadequate. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the U.S. in compliance with law, such as the EEA standard contractual clauses, the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension thereto (which allows for transfers for to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework), these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or elsewhere. The inability to import personal data to the U.S. may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trial activities in Europe and elsewhere; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties subject to European and other data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Other jurisdictions may adopt or have already adopted similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the U.S., are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.\nOur employees and personnel are permitted to use generative AI technologies to perform some of their work, and the disclosure and use of personal information data in generative AI technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, and consumer lawsuits. Furthermore, any use of generative AI to develop our proprietary technology and compounds may also impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights. If we are unable to use generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we may contractually be subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups and, we are, or may become subject to such obligations in the future. We are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misleading, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\nOur obligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers’ data privacy expectations) are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion and creating uncertainty. These obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or in conflict. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial and time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may even require us to change our business model.\nAlthough we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third-parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply such obligations that impacts our compliance posture. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation (including class claims), additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, imprisonment of company officials, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.",
