      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOVERVIEW\nEssex Property Trust, Inc. (“Essex”), a Maryland corporation, is an S&P 500 company that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Essex owns all of its interest in its real estate and other investments directly or indirectly through Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “EPLP”). Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December 31, 2024, had an approximately 96.5% general partner interest in the Operating Partnership. In this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” also refer to Essex Property Trust, Inc., the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Essex and/or the Operating Partnership.\nEssex has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994. Essex completed its initial public offering on June 13, 1994. In order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT subsidiaries for various revenue generating or investment activities. A domestic taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular C Corporation. All taxable REIT subsidiaries are consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly apartment communities, located along the West Coast of the United States. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned or had ownership interests in 255 operating apartment communities, aggregating 62,157 apartment homes, excluding the Company’s ownership in preferred equity co-investments, loan investments, two operating commercial buildings, and a development pipeline comprised of various predevelopment projects (collectively, the “Portfolio”).\nThe Company’s website address is https://www.essex.com. The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, and the Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders are available, free of charge, on its website as soon as practicable after the Company files the reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information contained on the Company’s website shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report.\nBUSINESS STRATEGIES\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management.\nBusiness Strategies\nResearch Driven Approach to Investments – The Company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company continually assesses markets where the Company operates, as well as markets where the Company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating markets and focusing on the following strategic criteria:\n•Major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million;\n•Constraints on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built; (ii) political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as mountains or waterways;\n•Rental demand enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for-sale housing; and\n•Housing demand based on job growth, proximity to jobs, high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors.\nRecognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic, and local market research, and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.\nProperty Operations – The Company manages its communities by focusing on activities that may generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation. The Company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below:\n•Property Management – Oversee delivery and quality of the housing provided to our tenants and manage the properties financial performance.\n•Capital Preservation – The Company’s asset management services are responsible for the planning, budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the Company’s communities.\n•Business Planning and Control – Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with significant investment decisions. These plans include benchmarks for future financial performance based on collaborative discussions between property operations teams and the senior leadership team.\n•Development and Redevelopment – The Company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the Company’s communities.\nCURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES\nAcquisitions of Real Estate Interests\nThe table below summarizes acquisition activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($ in millions):\n\nProperty Name                             Location                         Apartment Homes       Essex Ownership Percentage                Contract Price at Pro Rata Share            \nBEXAEW Portfolio                          CA and WA                          1,480                                     100%                             $252.0                      (1)\nMaxwell Sunnyvale                         CA                                    75                                     100%                                            46.6         (2)\nARLO Mountain View                        CA                                   164                                     100%                                           101.1            \nPatina at Midtown                         CA                                   269                                     100%                                            58.4         (3)\nCentury Towers                            CA                                   376                                     100%                                            86.8         (4)\nBEX II Portfolio                          CA                                   871                                     100%                                           168.4         (5)\nBeaumont                                  WA                                   344                                     100%                                           136.1            \nTotal acquisitions                                                           3,579                                                                      $849.4                         \n(1)In March 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 49.9% interest in the BEXAEW LLC’s (“BEXAEW”) portfolio comprised of four communities for a total purchase price of $505.0 million on a gross basis. \n(2)In April 2024, the Company accepted the third-party sponsor’s common equity interest affiliated with its $14.7 million preferred equity investment. The community was consolidated on the Company’s financial statements at a $46.6 million valuation.\n(3)In July 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 49.9% common equity interest in Patina at Midtown for a total purchase price of $117.0 million on a gross basis. \n(4)In September 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 50% common equity interest in Century Towers for a total purchase price of $173.5 million on a gross basis. \n(5)In October 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 49.9% interest in the BEX II, LLC (“BEX II”) portfolio, comprised of four communities for a total contract price of $337.5 million on a gross basis. \nDispositions of Real Estate Interests\nAs part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets, the Company continually evaluates all of its communities and sells those communities that no longer meet the Company’s strategic criteria. The Company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities, other real estate investments or to fund other commitments. The Company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will the sale of these communities materially affect the Company’s ongoing operations. In general, the Company seeks to offset the dilutive impact on long-term earnings and funds from operations from these dispositions through the positive impact of reinvestment of proceeds.\nThe table below summarizes disposition activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($ in millions): \n\nProperty Name              Location                      Apartment Homes        Sale Price at Pro Rata Share            \nHillsdale Garden           CA                                697                          $205.7               (1)      \nTotal dispositions                                           697                          $205.7                        \n(1)    In October 2024, the Company sold its 81.5% interest in a consolidated co-investment, Hillsdale Garden, a 697-unit apartment home community, for a contract price of $252.4 million on a gross basis ($205.7 million at pro rata). \nDevelopment Pipeline\nThe Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. \nThe Company defines predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with an expected high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects. The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s development pipeline was comprised of various consolidated predevelopment projects with total incurred costs of $52.7 million. \nLong Term Debt\nDuring 2024, the Company made regularly scheduled principal payments of $3.1 million to its secured mortgage notes payable at an average interest rate of 3.5%.\nIn March 2024, the Operating Partnership issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due on April 1, 2034 with a coupon rate of 5.500% per annum (the \"2034 Notes\"), which are payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The 2034 Notes were offered to investors at a price of 99.752% of the principal amount. The 2034 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership, rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and are unconditionally guaranteed by Essex. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay debt maturities, including to fund a portion of the repayment of its outstanding 3.875% senior unsecured notes due May 2024 and for other general corporate and working capital purposes. In August 2024, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $200.0 million of the 2034 Notes at a price of 102.871% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest from and including March 2024, up to, but excluding, the settlement date of August 21, 2024, with an effective yield of 5.110% per annum. These additional notes have substantially identical terms of the 2034 Notes issued in March 2024.\nBank Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, Moody’s Investor Service and Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) credit agencies rated Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Stable, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had two unsecured lines of credit aggregating $1.28 billion. The Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility had an interest rate of Adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Adjusted SOFR”) plus 0.765% which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s credit ratings, adjusted for the facility’s sustainability metric adjustment feature, and a scheduled maturity date of January 2029 with two six-month extensions, exercisable at the Company’s option. In September 2024, the scheduled maturity date was extended from January 2027 to January 2029. The Company’s $75.0 million working capital unsecured line of credit had an interest rate of Adjusted SOFR plus 0.765%, which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s credit ratings, adjusted for the facility’s sustainability metric adjustment feature. Prior to its maturity in July 2024 the line of credit facility was amended such that the line’s capacity was increased from $35.0 million to $75.0 million and the scheduled maturity date was extended to July 2026.\nEquity Transactions\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $900.0 million (the “2024 ATM Program”). In connection with the 2024 ATM Program, the Company may also enter into related forward sale agreements whereby, at the Company’s discretion, it may sell shares of its common stock under the 2024 ATM Program under forward sale agreements. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of its common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receipt of the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date.\nThe 2024 ATM Program replaced the prior equity distribution agreement entered into in September 2021 (the “2021 ATM Program”), which was terminated upon the establishment of the 2024 ATM Program. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program or the 2021 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding forward sale agreements, and $900.0 million of shares remained available to be sold under the 2024 ATM Program. \nIn September 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan to allow the Company to acquire shares of common stock up to an aggregate value of $500.0 million. The plan supersedes the Company’s previous common stock repurchase plan announced in December 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $302.7 million of purchase authority remaining under the stock repurchase plan.\nCo-investments\nThe Company has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures or partnerships (including limited liability companies) through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100% of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership. For each joint venture the Company holds a non-controlling interest in the venture and, in most cases, may earn customary management fees, development fees, asset property management fees, and a promote interest.\nThe Company has also made, and may continue in the future to make, preferred equity investments in various multifamily stabilized communities or development projects. The Company earns a preferred rate of return on these investments.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCompany Overview and Values\nThe Company’s mission is to create quality communities in premier locations and it is critical to the Company’s mission that it attracts, trains and retains a talented and diverse team by providing a compelling place to work and opportunities for professional growth. The Company’s culture supports its mission and is guided by its core values: to act with integrity, to care about what matters, to do right with urgency, to lead at every level and to seek fairness. The Company is headquartered in San Mateo, CA, and has regional corporate offices in Woodland Hills, CA; Irvine, CA and Bellevue, WA. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had 1,715 employees, 99.8% of whom were full-time employees. A total of 1,293 employees worked on-site at our operating communities and 422 worked in our corporate offices. The Company’s employee statistics for 2024 include the following data as of December 31, 2024: the Company’s workforce was comprised of 6 self-identified ethnically diverse groups, making up 71% of our population, 52% of the Company’s managerial employees, and included 29% of its senior executives; there were 204 women in positions of manager or higher, equating to 59% of managerial positions in the Company; the Company’s workforce self-identified as 41% female and 58% male (1% chose not to disclose their gender); and, 55% of the Company’s corporate associates self-identified as female. \nWorkplace Culture\nThe Company believes it has a broad perspective that better serves both the communities it operates in and the associates it employs due to fostering one of the most talented and diverse workforces among its peers in the real estate industry. The Company also supports employee-led resource groups which are open to all employees and intended to foster a sense of community and inclusion for associates at the Company that are intended to engage, educate, enable, and empower the Company’s employees.\nTraining and Development\nThe Company values leadership at every level and enables the same by providing opportunities for all associates to develop personal and professional skills through programs that encourage associate retention and advancement. The Company currently offers training courses to its associates via Workday Learning, and its associates spent 13,122 hours learning in 2024. The Company also provides its associates with an annual $3,000 tuition reimbursement to further support outside professional growth opportunities. To identify, retain and reward top performers, the Company engages in meaningful internal succession planning and offers a tenure program, excellence awards, and a bonus recognition program to reward associates for good teamwork, good ideas, and good service. The Company encourages internal promotions and hiring for open positions, and the executive team actively mentors the Company’s top talent to ensure strong leadership at the Company for the future. 38% of the Company’s associates have approached or surpassed the Company’s average tenure of 6.57 years, with 22% reaching beyond 10 years of service.\nEmployee Safety, Health, and Wellness\nSafety is a top priority. The Company deeply cares about the wellbeing of its associates and residents. The Essex Safety Committee, comprised of key stakeholders across departments, meets quarterly and reviews the overall safety of the company in both our corporate offices and our communities. To maximize real-time responses, the Company has also established a working safety subcommittee that meets bi-weekly. The Company has implemented enhanced safety programs, which include a new Workplace Violence Prevention Program enacted companywide in 2024, regular safety inspections, emergency preparedness processes, hazard identification and control protocols, and related associate training.\nThe Company’s safety policies align with its health and wellness goals and seeks to proactively prevent workplace accidents and protect the health, wellness and safety of the Company’s associates through training and analysis of incident reports. Additionally, the Company offers retirement support, associate discount programs, a mental health program (which includes counseling and coaching sessions for mental well-being support at no cost), refresh days for our operations teams, and health benefit credits for participation in wellness programs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company offers competitive compensation to secure and retain top talent. Alongside competitive pay, the Company is committed to pay parity, and conducts a pay analysis on an annual basis which includes the development and use of a robust, multiple regression analysis model to confirm the Company’s continued achievement of gender pay parity.\nBeyond competitive compensation, the Company offers a suite of benefits, including health insurance, a retirement plan with a $6,000 annual matching potential benefit, life and disability coverage, supplemental paid parental leave, and the robust health and wellness support programs noted above. Additionally, the Company offers an associate housing discount.\nEmployee Engagement\nIn order to engage and promote communication with our associates and solicit meaningful feedback on our efforts to create a positive work environment, the Company issues engagement surveys to all associates to measure 10 key drivers of employee engagement including goal setting, organizational fit, well-being, freedom of opinion, meaningful work, management support and recognition, among others. Engagement surveys are split into three phases: new hire surveys, Company-wide annual surveys, and exit surveys. 90% of Company employees participated in the surveys in 2024. The Company’s overall engagement score on the surveys was 8 out of 10. Goal setting, Performance, and Alignment were recognized as the top three areas of strength for the organization.\nCommunity and Social Impact\nThe Company believes volunteering can create positive change in the communities where our associates live and work and that the Company’s commitment to giving back helps it attract and retain associates. The Company’s volunteer program is aimed at supporting and encouraging eligible associates to become actively involved in their communities through the Company’s support of charity initiatives and offering paid hours for volunteer time. Additionally, the Company’s “Essex Cares” program provides direct aid to the Company’s residents, associates, and local communities.\nINSURANCE \nThe Company purchases general liability and property insurance coverage, including loss of rent, for each of its communities. The Company also purchases limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance. There are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits. The insurance programs are subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions in varying amounts. The Company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC (“PWI”), to self-insure certain earthquake and property losses. As of December 31, 2024, PWI had cash and marketable securities of $98.9 million, and is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.\nAll of the Company’s communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The Company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and in most cases property vulnerability analysis based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants. The Company manages this exposure, where considered appropriate, desirable, and cost-effective, by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events, by considering available funds and coverages provided by PWI and/or by purchasing seismic insurance. In most cases the Company also purchases limited earthquake insurance for certain properties owned by the Company’s co-investments.\nIn addition, the Company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures. \nBased on market conditions, the Company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages, or increase levels of self-insurance. Further, the Company may incur losses, which could be material, due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits.\nCOMPETITION\nThere are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting tenants. These include other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family homes. If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing housing, rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces competition from other REITs, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. Some competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the Company acquires and/or develops.\nWORKING CAPITAL\nThe Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2025.\nThe timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates, stock price, and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the Company’s plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\nAs a real estate owner and operator, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and may be subject to liability and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in our communities. See the discussion under the caption, “Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Operations - The Company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities.” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations, which discussion is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.\nOTHER MATTERS\nCertain Policies of the Company\nThe Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate.\nThe Company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within Southern California, Northern California, and the Seattle metropolitan area. The Company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions. However, the geographical composition of the portfolio is evaluated periodically and may be modified by management.",

      "text": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nFor purposes of this section, the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of Essex Property Trust, Inc.’s common stock. Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to Essex Property Trust, Inc.’s stockholders and Essex Portfolio, L.P.’s unitholders. You should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our Company, our properties and our business.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results of operations to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRisks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Operations\nGeneral real estate investment risks may materially adversely affect property income and values, and therefore our stock price may be materially adversely affected. If the communities and other real estate investments, including development and redevelopment properties, do not generate sufficient income to meet operating and financing expenses, cash flow and the ability to make distributions will be materially adversely affected. Income and growth from the communities may be further materially adversely affected by, among other things, the following factors, in addition to the other risk factors listed in this Item 1A:\n•changes in the general or local economic climate that could affect demand for housing, including an increase in the use of new technologies and artificial intelligence to replace workers, and other events negatively impacting local employment rates, tenant dispersion, wages and the local economy;\n•changes in demand for rental housing due to a variety of factors, including changing demographics or policies governing legal immigration, which could lead to a relative decrease in the renting population;\n•changes in supply and cost of housing;\n•changes in economic conditions, such as high or sustained inflationary periods in which our operating and financing costs may increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents, thereby compressing our operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business, or deflationary periods where rents may decline more quickly relative to operating and financing costs; and\n•the appeal and desirability of our communities to tenants relative to other housing alternatives, including the size and amenity offerings, safety and location convenience, and our technology offerings.\nShort-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents, and the Company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire. If the Company is unable to promptly renew or re-let existing leases, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then the Company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. \nEconomic environments can negatively impact the Company’s liquidity and results of operations. In the event of a recession or other negative economic effects, including slowing job growth in key markets, the Company could incur reductions in rental and occupancy rates, property valuations and increases in costs. Any such recession or economic downturn may also affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy.\nRent control, or future or potential changes in applicable laws, or noncompliance with applicable laws, could materially adversely affect the Company’s stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations, and/or expose us to liability. The Company must own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop its properties in compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, rent control or stabilization laws, emergency orders, laws benefiting disabled persons, federal, state and local tax laws, landlord tenant laws, environmental laws, employment laws, immigration laws and other laws regulating housing, revenue management software and practices, or laws that are generally applicable to the Company’s business and operations. Changes in, or noncompliance with, laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and could require the Company to make significant unanticipated expenditures to address noncompliance.\nExisting and future rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, along with similar laws and regulations that expand tenants’ rights or impose additional costs on landlords, including any such laws or regulations imposed in response to natural disasters and/or media attention on the housing industry, may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs and thus such laws and regulations may materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations. Such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents, increase rents, evict tenants or recover increases in our \noperating expenses and could reduce the value of our communities or make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances. Expenses associated with our investment in these communities, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community.\nFuture pandemics could materially affect our business, financial condition, stock price, and results of operations. Due to the national and global impacts of a pandemic or other health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may be subject to eviction moratoria, temporary or permanent legislative restrictions, limits on rent increases and collection efforts, or may be legally required to, or otherwise agree to, restructure tenants’ rent obligations on less favorable terms than those currently in place. In the event of tenant nonpayment, default or bankruptcy, we may incur costs in protecting our investment, collecting delinquent rents, and re-leasing our property and we may have limited ability to renew existing leases or sign new leases at levels consistent with market rents. A pandemic or other health crisis may cause increased costs, lower profitability and market fluctuations that may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our business or negatively impact the ability of the Company’s third-party mezzanine loan borrowers and preferred equity investment sponsors to repay the Company.\nAcquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations. The Company’s acquisition of apartment communities may fail to meet the Company’s expectations due to factors including inaccurate estimates of future income, expenses, and the costs of improvements or redevelopment, which may be exacerbated by the lack of reliable market data due to inconsistent deal flow. Further, the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community. Also, in connection with such acquisitions, we may assume unknown or contingent liabilities, which could ultimately lead to material costs for us that we did not expect to incur. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations, and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of equity financing for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the Company’s existing stockholders. If the Company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit, there is a risk that, unless the Company obtains substitute financing, the Company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may not be available on advantageous terms.\nDevelopment and redevelopment activities may be delayed, not completed, and/or not achieve expected results. The Company pursues development and redevelopment projects, including densification projects, and those activities generally entail certain risks, including:\n•funds may be expended and management’s time devoted to projects that may not be completed on time or at all;\n•construction costs may exceed original estimates possibly making some projects economically unfeasible;\n•projects may be delayed or abandoned due to, without limitation, weather conditions, labor or material shortages, municipal office closures and staff shortages, government recommended or mandated work stoppages, protestors obstructing access or environmental remediation;\n•occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated; \n•expenses may be higher than anticipated, including, without limitation, due to inflationary pressures (including potentially exacerbated by the imposition of tariffs), supply chain issues, costs of litigation over construction contracts, environmental remediation or increased costs for labor (including potentially related to any shrinkage in the labor force or labor shortages related to changing immigration policies), materials and leasing; \n•we are reliant on third party contractors’ and vendors’ ability to deliver services and products as planned, and if the timeframe, quality or scope of such services and products are different than we expected, our projects may be subject to increased costs and our future income may be lower than expected; \n•we may be unable to obtain, or experience a delay in obtaining, necessary governmental approvals or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n•we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development or redevelopment of a community, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity; and \n•we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process.\nThe geographic concentration of the Company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s communities are concentrated in California and the Seattle metropolitan area, which exposes the Company to greater economic concentration risks. Factors that may materially adversely affect local market and economic conditions include regionally specific acts of nature (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, floods, etc.), layoffs affecting specific or broad sectors of the economy (such as technology-based companies), and those other factors listed in the risk factor titled “General real estate investment risks may materially adversely affect property income and values” and elsewhere in this Item 1A.\nThe Company is susceptible to adverse developments in economic and regulatory environments, such as increases in real estate and other taxes, and increased costs of complying with governmental regulations. The State of California is generally regarded as more litigious, highly regulated and taxed than many other states, which may reduce demand for the Company’s communities. Any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in California or Washington, or any decrease in demand for the Company’s communities resulting from the California or Washington regulatory or business environments, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. \nThe Company may experience various increased costs, including increased property taxes, to own and maintain its properties. Real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. Our real estate taxes in Washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates. A California law commonly referred to as Proposition 13 (“Prop 13”) generally limits annual real estate tax increases on California properties to 2% of assessed value. However, under Prop 13, property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a “change in ownership” of a property. Because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a “change in ownership” or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred, we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction. Therefore, the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past, including on a retroactive basis. Various initiatives to repeal or amend Prop 13, to eliminate its application to commercial and residential property, to increase the permitted annual real estate tax increases, and/or to introduce split tax roll legislation could increase the assessed value and/or tax rates applicable to commercial property in California. Further, changes in U.S. federal tax law could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property.\nThe Company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and property maintenance as its properties advance through their life cycles. In some cases, we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may materially adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the Company’s communities. There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting tenants, including other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family homes. Competitive housing in a particular area and fluctuations in cost of owner-occupied single- and multifamily homes caused by a decrease in housing prices, mortgage interest rates and/or government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental and/or other types of housing, or an increase in desire for more space due to work-from-home needs or increased time spent at home, could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to retain its tenants, lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced, rental or occupancy rates may drop, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company also faces competition from other businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. This competition may result in increased costs to acquire or develop apartment communities or impact the Company’s ability to identify suitable acquisition or development transactions.\nInvestments in mortgages, mezzanine loans, subordinated debt, other real estate, and other marketable securities could materially adversely affect the Company’s cash flow from operations. The Company may purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate and/or invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations. The Company may make or acquire mezzanine loans, which are generally subordinated loans. In general, investing in mortgages involves risk, including that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed, causing realized or unrealized losses; the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due and amounts recovered by the Company in connection with related foreclosures may be less than the amount owed; interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the Company’s cost of funds; in the case of junior mortgages, foreclosure of a senior mortgage could eliminate the junior mortgage; delays in the collection of principal and interest if a borrower claims bankruptcy; possible senior lender default or overconcentration of senior lenders in portfolio; and unanticipated early prepayments may limit the Company’s expected return on its investment. If any of the above were to occur, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s cash flows from operations.\nThe Company’s ownership of co-investments, including joint ventures and joint ownership of communities, its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners’ association or other entity, its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities, could limit the Company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance, refinance, sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated. The Company has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, certain co-investments, including joint \nventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100% of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership. \nJoint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets, which may prevent the Company from taking action without the partners’ approval. A joint venture partner may have interests that are inconsistent with those of the Company or may take action contrary to the Company’s interests or policies. Consequently, a joint venture partner’s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. In some instances, the Company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to exercise a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause the Company to sell its interest, or acquire a partner’s interest, at a time when the Company otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction, and may result in the valuation of our interest or our partner’s interest at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income. Should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, the Company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities.\nFrom time to time, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, makes certain co-investments in the form of preferred equity investments in third-party entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing, financing, or managing real property. The Operating Partnership’s interest in these entities is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity, which may limit the Operating Partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such co-investment. The Operating Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such co-investment. In the event that such co-investment or the partners in such co-investment become insolvent or bankrupt or fail to develop or operate the property in the manner anticipated, or are unable to refinance or sell their interest as planned, the Operating Partnership may not receive the expected return in its expected timeframe or at all and may lose up to its entire investment. Additionally, the preferred return negotiated on these co-investments may be lower than the Company’s cost of funds. The Company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the Company.\nThe Company also owns properties indirectly under “DownREIT” structures. The Company has entered into, and in the future may enter into, transactions that could require the Company to pay the tax liabilities of partners that contribute assets into DownREITs, joint ventures or the Operating Partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which are generally within the Company’s control, occur. Although the Company plans to hold the contributed assets or, if such assets consist of real property, defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company may not be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nAlso, from time to time, the Company invests in properties (i) which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners’ associations and other entities and/or (ii) subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreements or where a master landlord may have certain rights to control the use, operation and/or repair of the property. In these arrangements, we cannot guarantee that the terms of the shared facilities agreements will be enforced or interpreted in favor of the Company, and the Company’s inability to control expenditures, make necessary repairs and/or control certain decisions may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and/or the property’s safety, compliance with applicable laws, marketability or market value.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of other REITs and real estate companies, which may not yield anticipated results and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We may make acquisitions of and/or investments in other REITs and real estate companies or enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures, which involves risks and uncertainties and may not be successful. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment, or joint venture opportunities, consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition. The integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. Pre-acquisition property due diligence may not identify all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions. Any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing, which, in the case of debt financing, would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and, in the case of equity or equity-linked financing, could be dilutive to Essex’s stockholders and the Operating Partnership’s unitholders. Additionally, the value of these investments could decline for a variety of reasons. These and other factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, the Company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited. Real estate investments are illiquid and, in our markets, can at times be difficult to sell at prices we find acceptable, which may limit our ability to promptly reduce our portfolio in response to \nchanges in economic or other conditions and otherwise may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to lease its commercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates and the longer-term leases for existing space could result in below market rents over time. When leases for our existing commercial space expire, the space may not be relet on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms.\nThe Company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities. Under various federal, state and local environmental and public health laws, regulations and ordinances, we have been required, and may be required in the future, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility, to provide warnings about certain chemicals, investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties (including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas) or properties that we acquire, develop, manage or directly or indirectly invest in. We may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for compliance and response costs, property damage, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases. While the Company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which would have a material adverse effect on our business, or results of operations, potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial. Further, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts, may materially adversely affect our ability to borrow against, develop, sell or rent the affected property, including due to any liens imposed on the impacted property by any government agencies for penalties or damages.\nThe Company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties; however, such coverage is not fully available for all properties and, as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available, it may be insufficient or may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties. While we conduct pre-acquisition and development Phase I environmental site assessments, such assessments may not discover, ascertain or quantify the full extent of the environmental conditions at or near a given property.\nMold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials. The Company has adopted policies to address and resolve reports of mold when it is detected, and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the affected property, however, the Company may not identify and respond to all mold occurrences. \nThe Company may incur general uninsured losses or may experience market conditions that impact the procurement of certain insurance policies. The Company purchases general liability and property, including loss of rent, insurance coverage for each of its communities and cyber risk insurance. The Company may also purchase limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance for some of its communities. However, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, wildfires, pollution, environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes and floods that are uninsurable or not economically insurable. The Company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC (“PWI”), to self-insure certain earthquake and property losses for some of the communities in its portfolio. A decline in the value of the securities held by PWI may materially adversely affect PWI’s ability to cover all or any portion of the amount of any insured losses. Despite our insurance coverage, the Company may incur material losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits. \nOur communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The Company manages and evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models and property vulnerability analyses based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants, and by making upgrades to certain properties to better resist seismic events and/or by purchasing seismic insurance in some cases. While the properties were built to the seismic codes in place at the time of construction, not all properties have been, or are required to be, retrofitted to the current seismic codes. Thus, some properties may be subject to physical risk associated with earthquakes, and may suffer significant damage, including, but not limited to, collapse for any number of reasons, including structural deficiencies. Seismic coverage is limited and may not cover the Company’s seismic related losses.\nOur properties or markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks, shootings, or other acts of violence, which could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially, cause uninsured losses, materially adversely affect the value of and our ability to operate our communities, subject us to significant liability claims, or otherwise impair our ability to achieve our expected results.\nAlthough the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities, employees, tenants, and compliance with applicable laws, it may still incur material losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, copayments or losses in \nexcess of applicable insurance coverage. In the event of a substantial loss, insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the Company’s lost investment, or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses. \nChanges in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the Company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed. In addition, a recently destabilized insurance market, and certain causalities and/or losses incurred may expose the Company in the future to higher insurance premiums.\nClimate change may materially adversely affect our business. As a result of climate change, we may experience extreme weather, an increase in frequency and severity of natural disasters, changes in precipitation, temperature, wildfire and drought exposure, and impacts of sea-level rise, all of which may result in physical damage, a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or affected by these conditions, damage to our properties, disruption of services at our properties or increased costs associated with water or energy use and maintaining or insuring our communities. Transition risks associated with climate change may result in interruptions in energy access, increased energy costs, or increased regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations regarding reporting and energy efficiency. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, even if not directly impacting the Company’s current markets, the types and pricing of insurance the Company is able to procure may be materially adversely affected and our financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We could experience increased costs related to further developing our communities to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation on climate change or natural disaster response could result in temporary rent control, temporary eviction moratoria, increased operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities (for example, increased costs associated with meeting electric vehicle charging mandates) and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nAccidental death or severe injuries at our communities due to wildfires, floods, other disasters or hazards could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events, and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, we may not have the ability to respond immediately to a major event, which may cause increased losses.\nAdverse changes in laws may materially adversely affect the Company’s liabilities and/or operating costs relating to its properties and its operations. Increases in real estate taxes and income, service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to tenants in the form of higher rents, and may materially adversely affect the Company’s cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on its debts. Additionally, ongoing political volatility may increase the likelihood of significant changes in laws that could affect the Company’s overall strategy. Changes in laws increasing the potential liability of the Company and/or its operating costs on a range of issues, including those regarding potential liability for other environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, including without limitation, those related to structural or seismic retrofit or more costly operational safety systems and programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFailure to succeed in new markets or with new community operations formats may limit the Company’s growth. The Company may make acquisitions or commence development activity outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise, which may expose the Company to new risks, including, but not limited to an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies; an inability to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or to obtain land for development; an inability to hire and retain key personnel; and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. Additionally, we have adjusted our operating model to reduce the number of staff on-site at individual properties and instituted a hub model where specialized staff can service multiple properties from a central location and rely on certain technologies, such as virtual apartment tours, to further reduce the need for on-site staffing. There may be resistance to such change from our residents, and if we experience difficulty in retaining residents, this could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. Further, there are unknown risks with relying on new technologies and operating models, such as whether there is consumer preference for in-person tours or if we are not able to as rapidly respond to resident demands, and we cannot guarantee that this model will be successful, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and reputation depend on our ability to continue providing high quality housing and consistent operation of our communities, the failure of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We provide tenants with reliable services, including water and electric power, along with the consistent operation of our communities, including a wide variety of amenities. Public utilities, especially those that provide water and electric power, are fundamental for the consistent operation of our communities. The delayed delivery or any prolonged interruption of these services may cause tenants to terminate their leases or may result in a reduction of rents and/or increase in our costs or other issues. In addition, we may fail to provide quality housing and continuous access to amenities as a result of other factors, including government mandated closures, mechanical failure, power outage, human error, vandalism, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism or similar events. \nSuch events may also expose us to additional liability claims and damage our reputation and brand and could cause tenants to terminate or not renew their leases, or prospective tenants to seek housing elsewhere. Any such failures could impair our ability to continue providing quality housing and consistent operation of our communities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. The Company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets, including those assets it invests in indirectly or places subordinated loans on through its preferred equity and mezzanine lending program, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Factors considered in evaluating impairment of the Company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits, recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature. Generally, a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted, estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date. Assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management. There can be no assurance that the Company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the Company’s assets, including those assets it invests in indirectly or places subordinated loans on through its preferred equity and mezzanine lending program. Any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with land holdings for future developments and related activities. Real estate markets are highly uncertain and the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly. In addition, carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability. If there are changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell, we may be required to take impairment charges which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal information and we rely on information technology to sustain our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of the Company’s privacy or information systems, or those of our vendors or other third parties, could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on information technology hardware, software, networks and systems (collectively, “IT Systems”), some of which are provided by vendors, to process, transmit and store personal information, tenant and lease data, and other electronic information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records. Our business requires us and some of our vendors to use and store personal and other sensitive information of our tenants and employees, and our collection, use and other processing of personal information is governed by certain federal and state laws and regulations. Privacy and cybersecurity laws continue to evolve, with several states passing new data privacy laws that govern the processing of information about state residents, and laws may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. The Company endeavors to comply with privacy laws and regulations applicable to it, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which governs the collection, use, disclosure and security of information about California residents. The CCPA requires the Company to, among other things, provide certain disclosures to California residents, promptly respond to certain requests related to their data, and contractually impose certain obligations on vendors. Compliance with existing and future laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection may increase the Company’s operating costs and adversely impact the Company’s ability to market the Company’s properties and services, and any failure of our systems in place to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, reputation and financial condition.\nAlthough we have taken steps to abide by applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws, and strive to protect the security of our IT Systems and Confidential Information, the compliance and security measures put in place by the Company and its vendors cannot guarantee perfect compliance or provide absolute security, and the Company and its vendors’ IT Systems may be vulnerable to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information, including through social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), distributed denial-of-service attempts, data theft, account takeovers, social engineering/phishing, technological \nerror, employee error, malfeasance by insiders, misconfigurations, “bugs”, or other vulnerabilities in Company, or vendor, IT Systems. These threats may be amplified by emerging artificial intelligence technologies and can also come from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists. Any incident could compromise the Company’s or our vendors’ IT Systems (or the IT Systems of third parties that facilitate the Company’s or such vendors’ business activities), and the Confidential Information stored by or on behalf of the Company or such vendors could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen, resulting in fraud, including wire fraud related to Company assets or tenant payments, or other harm. Moreover, if there is a compliance failure, or if a cybersecurity incident affects the Company’s or vendors’ systems, whether through a breach of the Company’s IT Systems or a breach of the IT Systems of third parties, or results in the unauthorized release of Confidential Information, the Company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, which could increase our costs in attracting and retaining tenants, and other serious consequences may result. \nPotential other consequences include potential exposure to litigation, including government enforcement actions, private litigation (including class actions), fines or criminal penalties, negative reputational impacts that cause us to lose existing or future customers, and/or significant incident response, system restoration or remediation and future compliance costs, and potential exposure to a risk of loss including loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors, or such vendors’ financial condition, may not allow the Company to recover all costs related to a cybersecurity incident for which they alone or they and the Company should be jointly responsible for, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy and cybersecurity risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new techniques and tools that circumvent security tools, evade detection and remove forensic evidence, such as artificial intelligence, and the increased sophistication, techniques and activities of threat actors; accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. There can also be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our IT Systems and Confidential Information. Furthermore, given the nature of complex IT Systems we rely upon, and the scanning tools that we deploy across our networks and products, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities. We may be unable to comprehensively apply patches or confirm that measures are in place to mitigate all such vulnerabilities, or that patches will be applied before vulnerabilities are exploited by a threat actor. We maintain cyber risk insurance which may be insufficient type or amount to cover us against claims related to a cybersecurity incident, and we cannot be certain that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claims.\nIn the future, the Company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the Company’s cybersecurity measures to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or to further ensure compliance with privacy and cybersecurity laws. Despite these steps, the Company may suffer a significant cybersecurity incident in the future, unauthorized parties may gain access to Confidential Information stored on the Company’s or its vendors’ IT Systems, and any such incident may not be discovered in a timely manner. Any cybersecurity incident or failure in the implementation, compliance with or effectiveness of the Company’s IT Systems or cybersecurity program or those of third party service providers, or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or IT Systems of the Company could result in a wide range of material adverse effects to our business and results of operations.\nReliance on third party software providers to host systems is critical to our operations and to provide the Company with data, and regulation of those providers and practices may impact operational capabilities. We rely on, or may rely on in the future, certain key software vendors to support business practices critical to our operations, including the collection and understanding of rent and ancillary income, including artificial intelligence platforms, communication with our tenants, interaction and evaluation and/or qualification of our prospective tenants, and to provide us with data. The market is currently experiencing a consolidation of and increased scrutiny on these software vendors and algorithmic platforms, particularly in the multifamily space, which may negatively impact the Company’s choice of vendor and pricing options due to lack of optionality or litigation challenges of the vendor or the vendor’s underlying algorithmic platform. Moreover, if any of these key vendors were to terminate our relationship or access to data, or fail, we could suffer losses while we seek to replace the services and information provided by the vendors. Further, our failure, or our software vendors’ failure, to adopt, anticipate or keep pace with the new technologies, such as artificial intelligence solutions, may harm our ability to compete with our peers, decrease the value of our assets and/or impact our future growth.\nWe may from time to time be subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of these claims may result in defense costs, settlements, fines or judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, covered by insurance, the payment of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage and expose us to increased risks that would be \nuninsured. Litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could materially adversely affect our reputation and divert the attention of our management, which could materially adversely affect our operations and cash flow. A number of purported anti-trust class actions were filed against RealPage, Inc., a seller of revenue management software, and various lessors of multifamily housing which utilize this software, including the Company. The complaints allege collusion among defendants to artificially increase rents of multifamily residential real estate above competitive levels. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from such matters. The Company is also subject to various other legal and/or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of its business operations, including California private attorney general actions (“PAGA Claims”). The current political climate in California may continue to encourage plaintiffs’ attorneys to bring PAGA Claims and other class actions. \nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings\nCapital and credit market conditions and volatility, including significant fluctuations in the price of the Company’s stock, may affect the Company’s access to sources of capital and/or the cost of capital, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, stock price, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our current balance sheet, the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group, access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers provide some insulation from volatile capital markets. We primarily use external financing, including sales of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures. If sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms, we could be forced to limit our acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and/or take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt, such as selling assets, reducing our cash dividend or distributing less than 100% of our REIT taxable income. \nIn general, to the extent that the Company continues to face a challenging investment environment as access to capital and credit lacks clear trends (reflected by a shifting interest rate environment for debt financing, a fluctuating stock price for equity financing without corresponding changes to investment cap rates, and an inconsistent transactional market flow) the Company’s ability to make acquisitions, develop or redevelop communities, obtain new financing, and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be materially adversely affected, which would impact the Company’s financial standing and related credit rating.\nIn addition, if our ability to obtain financing is materially adversely affected, the Company’s stock price may be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity, which, in the case of secured financings, could result in foreclosure.\nDebt financing has inherent risks. The Company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including that cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the REIT distribution requirements of the Code; inability to renew, repay, or refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered apartment communities on favorable terms or at all, possibly requiring the Company to sell a property or properties on disadvantageous terms; inability to comply with debt covenants could trigger cash management provisions limiting our ability to control cash flows, cause defaults, or an acceleration of maturity dates; paying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties; and defaulting on secured indebtedness may result in lenders seeking a foreclosure or pursuing other remedies which would reduce the Company’s income and net asset value, its ability to service other debt, or create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet REIT distribution requirements. Any of these risks might result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on its debt. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures, depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms, which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance requirements of tax-exempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities. The Company has, and expects to continue using, variable rate tax-exempt financing, which provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants. If the compliance requirements of the tax-exempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates with respect to certain tenants, then our income from these properties may be limited. While we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax-exempt bonds outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, this may not always be the case. Some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities. Certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions, which may limit income from the tax-exempt financed communities if the Company is required to decrease its rental rates. If the Company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds may be terminated, the obligations under the bond documents may be \naccelerated and the Company may be subject to additional contractual liability. Notwithstanding the limitations due to tax-exempt financing requirements, the income from certain communities may be limited due to below-market rent requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community.\nThe indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility and restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe such actions to be in our best interests, including restrictions on our ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. The instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial and other covenants, which may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.\nInterest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses. The Company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage certain interest rate risks. Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they also may reduce the benefits to the Company if interest rates decline. If a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, the Company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other. Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the Company to increased credit risks. \nA downgrade in the Company’s investment grade credit rating could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. The Company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, as well as the Company’s stock price.\nChanges in the Company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness. The Company manages its debt to be in compliance with debt covenants under its unsecured bank facilities and senior unsecured bonds. However, the Company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the Company’s ability to service the additional debt, resulting in an increased risk of default on its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements. Any covenant breach or significant increase in the Company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.\nIf the Company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due, the default could trigger a cross-default or cross-acceleration under other indebtedness. A default, including a default under mortgage indebtedness, lines of credit, bank term loan, the indenture for the Company’s outstanding senior notes, or the Company’s interest rate hedging arrangements that is not waived by the applicable required lenders, holders of outstanding notes or counterparties could trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness, which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable.\nThe Company could be negatively impacted by the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing. In the event that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discontinue providing liquidity to our sector, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally, it may adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and, as a result, may adversely affect the Company and its growth and operations.\nRisks Related to Personnel\nThe Company depends on its personnel, whose continued service is not guaranteed. The Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, train and retain executive officers, senior officers and company managers. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the departure of any of the Company’s key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company. While the Company engages in regular succession planning for key positions, the Company’s plans may be impacted and therefore adjusted due to the departure of any key personnel. The Company must continue to recruit, train and retain qualified operational staff at its properties, which may be difficult in a highly competitive job market. Changes to our Company’s operational structure could result in an increase in issues or departures among our operational staff. Our ability to timely deliver quality customer service or to respond to building repair and maintenance requests may be negatively impacted without adequate operational staff, which may materially adversely affect the results of operations. \nAdditionally, we could be subject to labor union efforts to organize our employees from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and increase operational costs.\nThe Company’s Chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. The Company’s Chairman, George M. Marcus, is not an employee of the Company, and is involved in other real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest. Mr. Marcus owns interests in various other real estate-related businesses and investments. He is the Chairman of the Marcus & Millichap Company (“MMC”), which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service, investment and development firms. While conflict of interest protocols and agreements are in place, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the Company in acquiring and/or developing apartment communities. Due to potential competition for real estate investments, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the Company, which may be detrimental to the interests of Essex’s stockholders and the Operating Partnership’s unitholders.\nThe influence of executive officers, directors, and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have majority control over the Company. However, he has, and likely will continue to have, significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the Company’s stockholders.\nUnder the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the Company, the Company’s directors and executive officers, including Mr. Marcus, have substantial influence on the Company. Consequently, their influence could result in decisions that may not reflect the interests of all stockholders.\nOur related party guidelines may not adequately address all of the issues that may arise with respect to related party transactions. The Company has adopted “Related Party Transaction Approval Process Guidelines” that are intended to determine whether a particular related party transaction is fair, reasonable and serves the interests of the Company’s stockholders. Pursuant to these guidelines, related party transactions have been approved by the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) from time to time. There is no assurance that this policy will be adequate for determining whether a particular related party transaction is suitable and fair for the Company. Also, the policy’s procedures may not identify and address all the potential issues and conflicts of interests with a related party transaction.\nEmployee theft or fraud could result in loss. Should any employee compromise our information technology systems, commit fraud or theft of the Company’s assets, or misappropriate tenant or other information, we could incur losses, including significant financial or reputational harm, from which full recovery cannot be assured. We also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts.\nRisks Related to Taxes, Our Status as a REIT and Our Organizational Structure\nFailure to generate sufficient rental revenue or other liquidity needs and impacts of economic conditions could limit cash flow available for dividend distributions, as well as the form and timing of such distributions, to Essex’s stockholders or the Operating Partnership’s unitholders. Significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments, if any, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community. Such a reduction in income could cause the Board to reduce the amount of dividend distributions. The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as the Board may consider relevant. The Board may modify our dividend policy from time to time.\nEssex may choose to pay dividends in its own stock, which could materially adversely affect its stockholders. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay applicable taxes, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, the trading price of Essex’s stock could experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of Essex’s stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends.\nThe Company’s future issuances of common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt securities could be dilutive to current stockholders and materially adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. In order to finance the \nCompany’s acquisition and development activities, the Company could issue and sell common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt securities, including pursuant to its equity distribution program, issue partnership units in the Operating Partnership, or enter into joint ventures which may dilute stockholder ownership in the Company and could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nThe Maryland Business Combination Act may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the Company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Under the Maryland Business Combination Act (the “MBCA”), certain “business combinations”, including a merger, between a Maryland corporation and certain “interested stockholders” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and must be approved pursuant to certain supermajority voting requirements, subject to certain exemptions which include business combinations that are exempted by the Board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to this exemption, the Board irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the Company, Mr. Marcus and MMC or any entity owned or controlled by Mr. Marcus and MMC. However, other transactions with interested stockholders subject to the MBCA may be delayed or may not meet the related supermajority voting or other requirements of the MBCA, which may delay or prevent the consummation of such transactions. \nCertain provisions contained in the Operating Partnership agreement, Charter and Bylaws, and certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. While the Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership agreement may limit the Company’s power to act with respect to the Operating Partnership, which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that may otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise materially adversely affect their interests. \nThe Company’s Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. The Company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control, or otherwise create rights that could materially adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock. Additionally, the Company’s Charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock, which may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control, or discourage tender offers.\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be “control shares.” Although the Bylaws exempt the Company from the control share provisions of the MGCL, the Board may amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any time in the future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the Bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the MGCL. If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions of the MGCL could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control.\nThe Company’s Charter and Bylaws as well as the MGCL also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval by the Board, and that in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction. Those provisions include, among others, directors may be removed by stockholders, without cause, only upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of the directors, and with cause, only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of the directors; the Board can fix the number of directors and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the directors and the Board can classify the board such that the entire board is not up for re-election annually; stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders’ meeting; and for stockholders to call a special meeting, the meeting must be requested by not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting.\nStockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations. The Board determines our major policies, including our policies regarding investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. The Board may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. In addition, pursuant to the MGCL, all matters other than the election or removal of a director must be declared advisable by the Board prior to a stockholder vote.\nLoss of the Company’s REIT status would have a material adverse effect on the Company and the value of the Company’s common stock. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT, which requires it to satisfy various annual and quarterly requirements, including income, asset and distribution tests. Although the Company believes that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a REIT, it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the Company’s taxable income, and the Company would not be allowed to deduct dividends \npaid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income. The Company would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which the Company failed to qualify, unless it is entitled to relief under statutory provisions. The additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distributions, and the Company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining REIT status. As a result of all these factors, the Company’s failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and could materially adversely affect the value and market price of the Company’s common stock.\nComplying with REIT requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments.  To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy certain asset, income and distribution tests and other requirements, which could materially adversely affect us. We may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions. If we do not acquire new assets, we may not have sufficient depreciation expense to offset income and may have to make special distributions to stockholders. We also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. As a result, having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to: (1) sell assets in adverse market conditions; (2) borrow on unfavorable terms; or (3) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. Moreover, if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset, income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to REITs or may be subject to a 100% tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its stockholders. Changes to federal income tax laws, with or without retroactive legislation, could materially adversely affect the Company or its stockholders. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Company. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nFailure of one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a REIT could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT. The Company owns interests in multiple subsidiary REITs that have elected to be taxed as REITs under the Code. These subsidiary REITs are subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the Company. If any of the Company’s subsidiary REITs were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then the subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax. The Company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and it is possible that this could cause the Company to also fail to qualify as a REIT.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit the Company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. Under the Code, unless certain exceptions apply, any gain resulting from transfers or dispositions of properties that the Company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax, which could potentially adversely impact our status as a REIT. Since the Company acquires properties for investment purposes, it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions. However, if the Internal Revenue Service successfully contends that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the Company are prohibited transactions, then the Company would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction, and the Company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized.\nDividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of non-REIT corporations, which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the Company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock. Dividends paid by REITs to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from non-REIT corporations. U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct 20% of ordinary dividends from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs, such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends. This may cause investors to view REIT investments as less attractive than investments in non-REIT corporations, which in turn may materially adversely affect the value of stock in REITs.\nWe may face risks in connection with Section 1031 exchanges. We occasionally dispose of real properties in transactions intended to qualify as “like-kind exchanges” under Section 1031 of the Code. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis.\nPartnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible that partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest would be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of a partnership tax audit adjustment. We, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though Essex, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly. The partnership tax audit rules apply to Essex Portfolio, L.P. and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nGeneral Risks\nThe soundness of financial institutions could materially adversely affect us. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances generally in excess of federally insured limits at a limited number of financial institutions. The failure of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or our 401(k) assets. Certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities, and, from time to time, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. In the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties, we, or other parties to the transactions with us, may be unable to complete transactions as intended, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, certain of our tax-exempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds. If the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations, or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral, a default will occur under the applicable tax-exempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds.\nThe price per share of the Company’s stock may fluctuate significantly. The market price per share of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the factors discussed in this Item 1A, and actual or anticipated variations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations, earnings estimates, or dividends, the resale of substantial amounts of the Company’s stock, or the anticipation of such resale, general stock and bond market conditions, actual or anticipated actions taken by the Federal Reserve Bank, the general reputation of REITs and the Company, shifts in our investor base, the inability of the United States Congress to pass bills that continue to timely fund the federal government and its obligations, including due to the current political climate or partisanship, natural disasters, armed conflict or geopolitical impacts, or an active aggressor incident. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control and may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.\nOur score by proxy advisory firms or other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, the perception of our corporate governance, and thereby materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Various proxy advisory firms and other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors provide scores of our governance measures, nominees for election as directors, executive compensation practices, corporate responsibility and sustainability, and other matters that may be submitted to stockholders for consideration at our annual meetings. From time to time certain matters that we propose for approval may not receive a favorable score, or may result in a recommendation against the nominee or matter proposed. Unfavorable scores may lead to rejected proposals or a loss of stockholder confidence in our corporate governance measures, which could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCorporate responsibility, specifically related to sustainability factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks or litigation. Some investors and potential investors are focused on positive corporate responsibility and sustainability scores and business practices to guide their investment strategies, including whether to invest in our common stock. Additionally, rules and regulations continue to evolve relating to climate risk disclosures, human capital management and other corporate responsibility matters, and other regulatory bodies, such as the State of California, have issued laws or regulations relating to climate disclosures, despite a lack of emerging support and, in some cases, open opposition, from investors and potential investors for such rules and regulations. Additional local, state and federal laws and rules with respect to corporate responsibility and sustainability matters may be enacted in the future and the extent and scope of their requirements and impact on our business are unknown. If the criteria by which companies are scored changes, the Company may perform differently or worse than it has in the past, or it may become more expensive for the Company to access capital. The Company may face reputational damage in the event its corporate responsibility procedures, its board structure, or the reputations of its individual \nboard members do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Further, if we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, expectations or reporting requirements related to sustainability, or if we are perceived as failing, our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, both advocates and opponents to such matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns, shareholder activism, and litigation, to advance their perspectives, and certain jurisdictions are adopting or considering adopting laws seeking to limit the use of corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives in certain contexts. To the extent we are subject to such activism or fragmented regulation with respect to corporate responsibility or sustainability considerations, it may require us to incur costs to implement compliant initiatives or otherwise materially adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of the Company’s stock and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. \nWe could face adverse consequences as a result of M&A activity in the REIT sector and actions of activist investors. Due to consolidation pressure and M&A activity in the REIT sector, we may receive unsolicited acquisition proposals or become the target of activist investors seeking to force a sale or merger. If that occurs, management may be required to dedicate substantial time to evaluating such proposals or threats and various strategic alternatives, which could detract from their ability to focus on our core business. Such activity could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management team and our employees from executing our business plan, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nExpanding social media vehicles present additional risks. The use of social media, such as unauthorized live-streaming at our properties, could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or false comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation. In addition, employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nAny material weaknesses identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the Company’s stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting.\nIf the Company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s stock price.\nIncreased public, media, regulatory and governmental scrutiny of the housing industry could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations. The housing industry, and particularly real estate developers and the rental housing sector, has attracted heightened attention from the public, media, regulators, elected officials and advocacy groups regarding issues such as affordability, fair housing practices, evictions, rental rates, and revenue management practices, which has led to various proposals, laws and regulations affecting rental housing providers, including rent control measures, eviction restrictions, and revenue management constraints. Increased scrutiny presents companies in the rental housing sector, including us, with additional litigation risk, including class action lawsuits. Additionally, political pressure and public sentiment regarding the rental housing industry could influence the introduction and passage of new regulations or legislation that may restrict our operations or otherwise materially adversely affect our business model. These factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.",
