      "text": "\nItem 1.   Business\n------------------\nGeneral\n \nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. (“MPS,” “we,” or “us”) is a fabless global company that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronics solutions. Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor design expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life and create a sustainable future. We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.\n \nOur principal executive office is located in Kirkland, Washington. We have over 4,000 employees worldwide, with various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S.\n \nIndustry Overview\n \nSemiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment. Within the semiconductor industry, components can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or integrated circuits (“ICs”), in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs can be further divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. Analog ICs, in contrast, handle real world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound, or speed. In addition, analog ICs also perform power management functions, such as regulating or converting voltages, for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world applications to digital systems.\n \nWe focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency and density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixed-signal IC markets from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles, numerous market segments, technology that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies, importance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets. We have targeted product and market areas that we believe allow us to operate at above-average growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.\n \nEnd Markets and Applications\n \nWe design and develop our products for the enterprise data, storage and computing, automotive, communications, consumer, and industrial end markets. Enterprise data was our largest end market in 2024. The following table is a summary of the various key end market applications for our products, and those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                    Percentage of Total Revenue         \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnd Markets             Applications                                                                                                                            2024              2023              2022\nEnterprise Data         Cloud-based and on-premises CPU server and workstation applications, and server artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications       32.5     %        17.7     %        14.0     %\nStorage and computing   Storage applications, notebooks, and graphics cards                                                                               22.7     %        27.0     %        25.3     %\nAutomotive              Advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment, USB connectors, body electronics, motion control and lighting systems           18.8     %        21.7     %        16.7     %\nCommunications          Network infrastructure, satellite communications, optical modules, and other wireless applications                                10.2     %        11.3     %        14.0     %\nConsumer                Home appliances, gaming, smart TVs, lighting, monitors, and stereos                                                                9.1     %        12.9     %        17.8     %\nIndustrial              Power sources, industrial meter, security applications, and other industrial equipment                                             6.7     %         9.4     %        12.2     %\n \n  5 \n\n  \n\nProduct Families\n Our proprietary process and packaging technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power management ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer end markets. Our key product families include, but not limited to, the Direct Current (“DC”) to DC, Alternating Current (“AC”) to DC, driver metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, power management IC, current limit switch and lighting control products. Our product families are differentiated from those of our competitors with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making them cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. For example, DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as cloud-based and on-premises CPU servers and workstation applications, server AI applications, storage applications, notebooks, infotainment, power sources, home appliances, network infrastructure and satellite communications applications. We believe our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to their high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint, and high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they are designed to result in fewer components that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages, lower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices.\n\n In the future, we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to innovate while fulfilling our customers’ evolving needs, enter new market segments, obtain design wins, grow our sales in a diversified way across regions, expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\n \nCustomers, Sales and Marketing\n \nWe have sales offices in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S. Our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application. We maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products.\n \nOnce we secure our product positioning through our technical sales and applications engineers’ efforts, we then sell our products through third-party distributors and value-added resellers. In addition, we sell directly to certain original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us, which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including OEMs and ODMs. Our value-added resellers may second source other products and provide other services to customers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs.\n \nIn 2024, our two largest distributors accounted for 31% and 20% of our total revenue. In 2023, our three largest distributors accounted for 26%, 19% and 10% of our total revenue. In 2022, our two largest distributors accounted for 24% and 19% of our total revenue. No other direct customers accounted for more than 10% of our full-year, total revenue in any of the periods presented. Our revenue from indirect sales to one customer, which primarily comprised power management solutions for AI applications, was 17% of our total revenue in 2024. Our revenue from indirect sales to this customer was below 10% in both 2023 and 2022.\n \nCurrent distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the non-exclusive right to sell and shall use its best efforts to promote and develop our products in various markets. These agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date of invoice. In addition, we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements.\n \nBecause our sales are primarily billed and payable in U.S. dollars, our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 94%, 87% and 86%, respectively.\n \nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue. \n \nTypical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. We often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether, all of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels and reduced sales if we underestimate the demand for our products.\n \nResearch and Development\n \nWe have assembled a qualified team of engineers in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S. with core competencies in analog and mixed-signal design. Through our research and development efforts, we have developed a collection of intellectual property and know-how that we are able to leverage across our products and markets. These include the development of high efficiency power devices, the design of precision analog circuits and systems, expertise in mixed-signal design, packaging and solution development, integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies.\n \nOur research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design and implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation, our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area of process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog power processes for our next generation of ICs. We believe process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth. \n \n    6 \n\n  \n\nOur growth is fueled by our customers’ need for our power-efficient solutions. Consequently, we focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products in our research and development efforts in all three targeted areas. Our products are principally positioned to achieve lower power loss and enable significant reductions in circuit board space by shrinking or eliminating many passive components that are otherwise needed by competitors’ offerings. In addition, the life cycles of our products are typically over 10 years, reducing the manufacturing needs and associated carbon emissions associated with the production of replacement products.\n \nPatents and Intellectual Property Matters\n \nWe rely on our proprietary technologies, which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies.\n \nIn general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,917 patents/applications issued or pending, of which 608 patents have been issued in the U.S. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2044. Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the steps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\n \nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n \nManufacturing\n \nWe utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures. In contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies, which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners, we have developed our own proprietary process and packaging technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf. This close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ICs.\n \nWe currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. Once our silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped to the facilities in China, Taiwan, and Singapore that we and our partners utilize for wafer sort, which is a testing process performed to identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in China, Taiwan and Malaysia. The assembled ICs are then sent for final testing to the facilities in China, Taiwan and Malaysia that we and our partners utilize prior to shipping to our customers. Our strategy is to maintain a diversified supply chain.\n\n The manufacturing facilities we utilize in Asia enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs. We have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations.\n \nCompetition\n \nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products, our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our end customers’ energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. In some cases, our competitors have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM Semiconductor, Semtech, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments.\n \n\n    7 \n\n  \n\nWe expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell, because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with lower energy consumption, and achieve higher performance specifications than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, there has historically been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify, as our competitors add resources with which to compete against us.\n \nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. While we are subject to industry downturns, we have targeted product and market areas that we believe allow us to operate at above average industry performance levels over the long term.\n \nHistorically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend.\n \nGovernment Regulations\n \nWe are subject to international, federal and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling and product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws.\n \nWe and our supply chain, including the end products which contain our products, are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we, our supply chain or the providers of such end products, have operations or otherwise do business. Government regulations and import/export controls can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and in some cases unexpectedly, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures, operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation, operations, competitive position, or financial condition, and the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the U.S. and China.\n \nHuman Capital Management\n \nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixed-signal ICs, our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude. Analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key officers, managers, engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel, and there can be no assurance we will be successful.\n\n As of December 31, 2024, we employed 4,017 employees in various locations in Asia, Europe and the U.S., compared with 3,564 employees as of December 31, 2023. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced an employee-based work stoppage or strike.\n \nWe strive to maintain a culture that encourages innovation and create a workplace that values diverse skill sets and experience, a healthy and safe environment, and professional growth opportunities.\n\n\n•   We continue to recruit new talent from a diverse candidate pool through various university recruitment programs and employment websites targeting underrepresented groups. We provide unconscious bias training to promote an environment of inclusivity. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and have policies for reporting concerns or violations.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   We are an equal-opportunity employer, and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs. Our total compensation packages are competitive, fair, and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   We provide employees with access to various learning tools and resources to explore their interests and develop their business skills and knowledge.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   We have occupational health and safety management systems and environmental management plans in place. They include our standards for chemical and hazardous waste management, rules on the use of personal protective equipment, and safety training plans. Our largest testing facilities in Chengdu, China are ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certified.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   We support the well-being of our employees. In certain offices, we offer onsite flu shot clinics and other annual health checkups and workshops. Our largest facilities have amenities including fitness centers, sports courts and private rooms for nursing. We also offer free exercise classes, strength training and yoga in some of our offices.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n    8 \n\n  \n\nAvailable Information\n \nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge.

\n  11 \n\n  \n\nRisks Associated with Our Significant Operations in Asia, Particularly in China\n \nWe derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia and have significant operations in Asia, which may expose us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks. \n \nWe derive most of our revenue from customers located in Asia through direct sales or indirect sales under distribution arrangements and value-added reseller agreements with parties located in Asia. As a result, we are subject to significant risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 94% of our revenue was from customers in Asia. There are risks inherent in doing business in Asia, and internationally in general, including:\n \n\n•   changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax and trade laws in the U.S., particularly those associated with the recent change in administration, and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, and governmental action or restrict our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products may require export licenses;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. related to goods imported from regions in China with records of forced labor and other human rights issues;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies, which could affect the competitiveness of our products;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   transportation delays and other supply chain issues;\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   changes in tax regulations in China that may impact our tax status in Chengdu, Hangzhou and other regions where we have significant operations;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   multi-tiered distribution channels that may diminish visibility to end customer pricing and purchase patterns;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   international political relationships and acts or threats of war;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   terrorism and threats of terrorism;\n---------------------------------------\n\n•   adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters that may cause work stoppages and affect our operations in China;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   work stoppages;\n-------------------\n\n•   economic, social and political instability;\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n•   longer accounts receivable collection cycles;\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n•   currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting intercompany transactions;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   enforcing contracts generally; and\n--------------------------------------\n\n•   less effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIf we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers, we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions, in particular changing economic conditions in China.\n \nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slowing growth, recession, stagflation, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, tighter credit, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, higher unemployment, labor shortages, lower capital expenditures by businesses, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past, and could in the future, have a material adverse effect on logistics, demand for our products, and our product and operational costs. For example, to the extent there are economic uncertainties, some of our customers may cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us, which could impact our financial results and make our forecasting much more difficult.\n\nDemand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the U.S., Europe, China and the rest of Asia. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruptions, such as those resulting from global economic uncertainties, changes to trade laws and policies as a result in changes in the U.S. administration, and geopolitical tensions, or the rate or magnitude of economic recovery worldwide, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve. We also may not accurately assess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations, resulting in excess or insufficient inventory, increased costs, inability to forecast and adverse effects on our financial condition or operating results. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, and on our financial condition and operating results.\n \nIn particular, since we have significant operations in China, our business development plans, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political, social and economic developments in China. The current stagnation in China’s economy has adversely impacted, and could further adversely impact, our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and partners in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. \n \n  12 \n\n  \n\nThere are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in China, which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments.\n \nWe have manufacturing and testing facilities in China. We face the following risks, among others, with respect to our operations in China:\n \n\n•   challenges to hire and maintain a qualified workforce;\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   natural disasters such as earthquakes, flooding, severe heatwaves or droughts, which could result in power shortages or water restrictions in our facilities;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   challenges to maintain appropriate and acceptable manufacturing controls; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   higher than anticipated overhead and other operational costs.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIf we are unable to maintain our facilities in China at full operational status with qualified workers, appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels, we may incur costs higher than our current expense levels, which would affect our gross margins and operating expenses. In addition, if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n \nWe and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are subject to extensive Chinese government regulations, and the benefit of various incentives from Chinese governments that we and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers receive may be reduced or eliminated, which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in China. \n \nThe Chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in China. Additionally, the Chinese government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic activities in China. It exercises significant control over China’s economy through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\n\nAny additional regulations or the amendment or reinterpretation of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners and suppliers to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to manufacture or sell products and conduct business activities in China, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n The Chinese government and provincial and local governments have also provided, and may continue to provide, various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in China. Such incentives include cash awards, tax rebates, reduced tax rates, favorable lending policies and other measures, some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners, suppliers and us. Any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n \n Uncertainties with respect to China’s legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in policies, laws and regulations in China could materially and adversely affect our operations.\n\nChina’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since China’s legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations and enforcement of these laws and regulations are not always uniform and involve uncertainties. In addition, any new or amended laws and regulations related to foreign investments, manufacturing or other matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to operate business in China.\n \nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since China’s administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection than those that may be provided in other jurisdictions. These uncertainties or adverse rulings may impede our ability to enforce contracts in China and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n \nFurthermore, China’s legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effects. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until some time after the violation may have occurred. Such unpredictability regarding our contractual, property and procedural rights and any failure to quickly respond to changes in the regulatory environment in China could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations and execute on our business plans in China.\n \n  13 \n\n  \n\nWe are subject to export laws, trade policies and restrictions including international tariffs that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n \nWe are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that could limit or restrict the export of some of our products, supplies and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other individuals, including, in certain cases, dealings with or between us and our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export controls and economic sanctions may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales, but could in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We maintain an export compliance program, but our compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities, sanctions and restrictions on our business. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the past, they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. laws and regulations and sanctions, or threat of sanctions, that could limit or restrict the export of some of our products and services may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products, or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our customers’ end products and systems that incorporate our components could be subject to export laws, trade policies and other sales restrictions, which could indirectly affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, the increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting the sales of AI technologies or products. Any of such regulatory restrictions could, in turn, impact the sales of our products supporting AI applications.\n\n There has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain products and materials. Specifically, there have been several rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that have taken effect in the past few years, as well as additional tariffs imposed by the new U.S. administration in January 2025, some of which prompted, and could prompt additional, retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting both countries’ overall economic condition, as well as our business and financial results. If these tariffs continue or additional tariffs are imposed in the future, they could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in China and the U.S.\n\n Additionally, the imposition of tariffs is dependent upon the classification of goods under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff System (“HTS”) and the country of origin of the goods. Determination of the HTS and the origin of the goods is a technical matter that can be subjective in nature. Accordingly, although we believe our classifications of both HTS and origin are appropriate, there is no certainty that our assessment will be consistent with that of the U.S. government, particularly under the new U.S. administration. If the U.S. government does not agree with our determinations, we could be required to pay additional amounts, our ability to sell products in the U.S. may be restricted or eliminated and we may incur substantial additional costs or potential penalties.\n \nWe face political and other risks conducting business in Taiwan and Hong Kong, particularly due to their tense relationships with China.\n \nWe have significant business operations in Taiwan, and many of our manufacturing partners, suppliers and customers are located in Taiwan. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by changes in governmental and economic policies in Taiwan, social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Taiwan due to its unique international political status. Although Taiwan and China have significant economic and cultural relations, we cannot assure that relations between Taiwan and China will not face political, military or economic challenges or actions in the future. Any deterioration in the relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia, could disrupt our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n In addition, the Chinese government has promulgated various laws and regulations impacting economic and political stability within Hong Kong where many of our customers are located. Due to the sensitive political climate these laws and regulations created, there are risks that these laws and regulations, or future, more stringent laws or regulations, may trigger sanctions or other forms of restrictions by foreign governments including the U.S., which could affect companies, including us, conducting business in Hong Kong. It is difficult for us to predict the impact, if any, the implementation of these laws and regulations will have on our business, as such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n \nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies, including the Renminbi, may adversely affect our results of operations.\n \nMany of our manufacturing and other suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in China for the foreseeable future. Recently, there has been an increased level of global currency fluctuation and volatility. If the value of the Renminbi rises against the U.S. Dollar, there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located outside China, which could adversely affect our financial results and operations. In addition, our sales are primarily denominated in the U.S. Dollar. If the value of the U.S. Dollar rises against other currencies, it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets, which could negatively and materially impact our business and results of operations.\n\n We incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including intercompany transactions between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by those subsidiaries. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record, which could have an adverse and material impact on our results of operations.\n \n  14 \n\n  \n\nA significant portion of our manufacturing, testing, assembly and packaging capacity comes from suppliers in China, which exposes us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks.\n A significant portion of our manufacturing, testing, assembly and packaging capacity comes from key suppliers located in China. As a result, we are subject to significant political, regulatory, tax, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks due to this geographic concentration in our business. Although our management has established a long-term strategy to diversify capacity outside China, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify, qualify and engage additional foundry partners and other suppliers in other regions in a timely manner or at all in order to mitigate these risks, or that the quality, price or terms of such production will be sufficient or acceptable to us, any of which could negatively and materially harm our business and results of operations.\n \nRisks Associated with Product Demand and Sales\n \nWe may not achieve growth rates or financial performance comparable to past years.\n\nIn the past, our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products. We are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates, or a decline in revenue compared to past periods, including increased competition, loss of certain of our customers, unfavorable changes in our operations, changing technologies and customer requirements and demand, reduced global electronics demand, a deterioration in market conditions including as a result of the global economic uncertainties and tariffs, end-customer market downturns, market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products, and litigation. A decrease in our rate of growth, or a decline, in revenue, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n \nIf demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve, our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\n \nWe believe that the application of our products in the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communication and consumer end markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue. If we are not able to accurately predict new end markets to serve or if the demand for our products declines in certain of our current major end markets, our revenue would decrease compared to prior year periods and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as technology evolves, the requirement to integrate the functionalities of various components, including our discrete semiconductor products, onto a single chip and/or onto other components of systems containing our products increases. Should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer, or if our products cannot be integrated effectively into changing technological requirements of our customers, demand for our products could decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n \nDue to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses.\n Because we provide components for end products and systems, demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand. As a result, we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses. Our expenses and revenue depend on the timing, size, and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast, as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems. In addition, demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory. Our sales to distributors are also subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which, in itself, is inherently difficult to forecast. All of these factors continue to be exacerbated by the adverse effects of macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, decreased economic output, fluctuations in currency rates, and geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East conflict. If our customers reduce their orders from us, do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand, our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly or decline on a quarterly basis, and we may have difficulty forecasting our expenses and inventory levels, which could reduce our revenue or revenue opportunities, result in inventory write-offs, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to, or better than, what we have experienced in the past, which could impact our overall gross margin and financial performance.\n\n Our success depends on our development and sale of products that are differentiated in the market, with gross margins that have historically been above industry averages. Should we fail to improve or maintain our gross margins in the future, and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages or meet or exceed our historical margins, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business. \n Our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. A fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets. Our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products, which could result in product obsolescence, decreased revenue, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.\n\n As we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that may be unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. Some of our new product lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past. If we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets.\n\n The success of a new product depends on our ability to achieve design wins with key distributors and end-customers, as well as our ability to accurately forecast long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of other factors, including:\n \n\n•   timely and efficient completion of process design and device structure improvements;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly, and test processes;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the ability to secure and effectively utilize fabrication capacity in different geometries;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n    15 \n\n  \n\n\n•   product performance;\n------------------------\n\n•   integration with other components and technologies;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   product availability and pricing;\n-------------------------------------\n\n•   product quality and reliability; and\n----------------------------------------\n\n•   effective marketing, sales and services.\n--------------------------------------------\n \nTo the extent that we fail to timely obtain design wins, introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n \nThe loss of any significant distributors, value-added resellers or direct or indirect customers, or failure to collect accounts receivable from them could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\n \nWe market our products either through distribution arrangements and value-added resellers, or through our direct sales to customers that include OEMs and ODMs. A relatively small number of distributors account for a significant portion of our revenues. Specifically, our top three customers, all of which are distributors, accounted for 61%, 55% and 52% of our revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue from indirect sales to one customer was 17% of our total revenue in 2024. If we lose a major customer or a major customer changes their products or technologies or chooses to purchase our competitors’ products such that they decrease, or eliminate the amount of our products they purchase, and we are not able to replace such customers with additional orders from existing customers or new customers, this could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future financial condition and operating results. While we could partner with other distributors or value-added resellers to replace any of our customers, the change in business partners could interrupt our operations, cause us to have to identify and qualify new partners, and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nMoreover, we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of OEMs and ODMs. Although we communicate with OEMs and/or ODMs in an attempt to achieve “design wins,” which are decisions by OEMs and/or ODMs to incorporate our products, we do not have purchase commitments from these customers. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the OEMs and/or ODMs will continue to incorporate our ICs into their products, even if we may have secured a design win with them. OEM technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly, and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins. We cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large OEMs, or that the OEMs will be successful in selling products that incorporate our ICs. \n \nFurthermore, we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to our key direct or indirect customers for other reasons, including:\n \n\n•   many of our customers have pre-existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors, including, in some cases, suppliers with a broader array of products than we offer, that may affect our customers’ decisions to purchase our products;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   our customers may be subject to investigations and litigation that could result in injunctive or other relief that negatively impacts sales of their products, which in turn would result in a decrease in demand for our products; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which could result in lower sales of our products, and increase their negotiating leverage with us.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nA material reduction in orders, or rumors or threats of same, by any of our significant direct or indirect customers, could reduce our revenue, cause a decline in our stock price, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur products must meet specifications, and undetected defects and failures may occur, which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk.\n \nOur customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance, energy efficiency and reliability that our products must meet. ICs as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments, which might require product replacement or recall. Further, our third-party manufacturing processes or changes thereto, or changes in the materials used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail. From time to time, we have experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems. Our standard warranty period is generally one or two years, which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures. If defects and failures occur in our products, we could experience a loss of customers and/or a decrease in revenue, increased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments, and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our operating results.\n\n In addition, product liability claims may be asserted by our customers. Although we currently have insurance, there can be no assurance that we have obtained sufficient insurance coverage or that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage. Our insurance providers could deny or challenge these claims, and as a result, reimbursement to us is not guaranteed or could be delayed. If coverage is denied, we may not have sufficient resources to pay for these claims. Furthermore, we may experience a significant increase in premiums and therefore decide to self-insure, which may not meet the expectations or requirements of certain customers. All of these factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n    16 \n\n  \n\nBecause of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products.\n \nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales. It generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype. Only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins. This sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. Volume production of products that use our ICs, if any, may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale. Sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons, including: \n \n\n•   our customers usually complete an in-depth technical evaluation of our products before they place a purchase order;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the commercial adoption of our products by OEMs and ODMs is typically limited during the initial release of their product to evaluate product performance and consumer demand;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   our products must be designed into our customers’ products or systems; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the development and commercial introduction of our customers’ products incorporating our products are frequently delayed.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nAs a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue. The lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders, particularly as our customers are exposed to economic risks in connection with global economic uncertainty and political tensions, including tariffs, as well as the risks inherent in introducing new products or entering new markets. Our sales are made by purchase orders. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales. If customer cancellations or purchase order changes occur, we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses.\n \nRisks Associated with Supply and Manufacturing\n \nOur ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers.\n \nAlthough we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by their available capacity, particularly capacity in the geometries we require, at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us. As a result, this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth. In addition, an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us. Our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements. If our suppliers extend lead times, limit supplies or the types of capacity we require, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, our gross margin may materially and unexpectedly decline. In addition, if we experience supply delays or limitations, our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand, which could materially and adversely impact our revenue and results of operations. \n \nThere may be unanticipated costs associated with increasing our third-party suppliers’ manufacturing capacity.\n \nWe anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity from our third-party supply foundries, assembly shops, and testing facilities. In order to facilitate such growth, we may need to enter into strategic transactions, investments and other activities, with both our current suppliers and new suppliers. The need for additional manufacturing, assembly and testing involves numerous risks, including:\n \n\n•   the costs and expense associated with such increased capacity, including requirements to make long-term purchase commitments including upfront cash deposits to our suppliers;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the availability of modern foundries to be developed, acquired, leased or otherwise made available to us or our third-party suppliers;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the ability of foundries and our third-party suppliers to obtain the advanced equipment used in the production of our products;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   delays in identifying and negotiating agreements with new foundries and suppliers; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   environmental, engineering or manufacturing qualification problems relating to existing or new foundry facilities, including delays in qualification of new foundries by our customers.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThese and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our third-party supplier capacity. If our manufacturing costs increase, including as a result of inflationary pressure, or we experience supply constraints, we may be required to raise the prices of our products to remain profitable, which could result in a loss of customers. If we are unable to increase or maintain our manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to meet demand, which would harm our revenue and results of operations and may result in a loss of customers as they seek supply from other sources.\n \n    17 \n\n  \n\nWe currently depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products. If any of our wafer suppliers are acquired, become insolvent or capacity constrained, or are otherwise unable to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields or at anticipated costs, our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders.\n \nShould any of our suppliers be acquired or become insolvent or capacity constrained, we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders, which would likely cause a decline in our revenue.\n\n While certain aspects of our relationships with these suppliers are contractual, many important aspects of our relationships depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of such relationships with the suppliers. Our relationships could be negatively impacted by changes in control or changes in the management team of the suppliers. In addition, the fabrication of ICs is a highly complex and precise process. Problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ICs on each wafer to be non-functional. This could potentially reduce yields and supply of our products. The failure of our suppliers to provide wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders and would likely cause a decline in our revenue.\n\n In addition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures resulting from worldwide supply chain constraints and other factors, have increased, and may continue to increase, the prices we pay to our suppliers. As a result of the increased costs, we have raised, and may be required to further raise the prices of our products in order to remain profitable, which could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenue. If we are unable to increase our prices to reflect higher costs, our margins will decrease.\n\n Further, as is common in the semiconductor industry, our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice. If our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers, we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nWe might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated.\n \nWe do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by third-party subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by third-party subcontractors. Also, due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products. In addition, events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Middle East conflict and supply chain disruptions may materially impact our assembly or testing suppliers’ ability to operate. Any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nWe purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we may have insufficient or excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial position.\n \nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we purchase our inventory from third-party manufacturers. We place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products. While most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels, we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers. Some of our customers and distributors may nevertheless cancel orders as a result of economic conditions, their own specific business challenges or for other reasons. In the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of products within the timeframe that is required, we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customers’ demands. In addition, a negative trend in market conditions could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory. If we inaccurately assess market conditions for our products, we could have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands resulting in lost potential revenue. In the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders, unexpected order cancellations, injunctions due to patent litigation, import/export restrictions or product returns, we may have excess inventory which, if not sold, may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold. If any of these situations were to arise, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nThe price and availability of commodities, such as gold, copper and silicon, may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n \nOur products incorporate commodities such as gold, copper and silicon. An increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n \n    18 \n\n  \n\nRisks Associated with Industry Dynamics and Competition\n \nThe highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has resulted in significant and sometimes prolonged downturns, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nHistorically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. Certain segments of the semiconductor market may also experience significant downturns while other segments are growing. These conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity, as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices, which have resulted, and could in the future result, in lower demand for our products, downward pressure on the price of our products, and/or increased inventory due to our customers’ delayed production schedule. Because a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall. Any significant or prolonged downturns, whether in the overall semiconductor industry or in a specific market segment, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\n \nIn recent years, there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs, strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company. In addition, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source suppliers of multiple products for customers. This could harm our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nWe compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our market share may decline if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively.\n The analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit application engineers and design talent, introduce new products, and maintain the rate at which we introduce new products. We compete with domestic and foreign semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products, and, in some cases, may have broader product offerings that enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of varying size and financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.\n\n We cannot guarantee that our products will continue to compete favorably, or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our markets , which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. \n\n In addition, from time to time, governments may provide subsidies or make other investments that could give competitive advantages to competing semiconductor companies. For example, in August 2022, the U.S. enacted the CHIPS Act, which, among other things, provides funding to increase domestic production and research and development in the semiconductor industry. Because we operate a fabless business model, we were not eligible for such investments. Many of our competitors benefitted from the investments, which will help increase their production capacities, shorten their lead times and gain market share. These competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may face competition from customers developing products internally.\n \nOur customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. The prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers’ acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance and qualification of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. Customers may continue to increase their use of internally developed components. They may also decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. If any of these situations were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n \n    19 \n\n  \n\nRisks Associated with IT and Cybersecurity\n \nImplementation of enhanced enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) or other IT systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations.\n \nFrom time to time, we may implement new ERP software solutions or upgrade existing systems. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including system downtime causing interruptions in business operations. In addition, transitioning to these new systems may require significant capital investments and personnel resources. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations and financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition or results of operations.\n \nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyberattacks, systems integration issues and unauthorized use of AI tools could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm our reputation, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\n Experienced hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. As AI capabilities improve, threat actors may quickly develop more sophisticated and convincing attacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack information systems with increased speed and efficiency or create more effective phishing emails. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, financial reporting or other critical functions.\n\n In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data on our internal systems, network and servers, such as proprietary business and financial information, and confidential data pertaining to our customers, suppliers and business partners. Maintaining security of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy. We devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data. However, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions, any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Remote working arrangements, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Middle East conflict, and AI-powered cybersecurity threats have also heightened our potential exposure to cyberattacks, which could put the sensitive data we store on our internal systems at risk. If any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our reputation and relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to risks of litigation and possible significant liability.\n \nPortions of our IT infrastructure may also experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales or a loss of customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results and reputation.\n\n Unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems, breach of the systems of our suppliers by an unauthorized party, or through employee error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected individuals and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation and substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n    20 \n\n  \n Our ability to manage and aggregate data may be limited by the effectiveness of our policies, programs, processes, systems and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, used, stored, protected, processed and shared. Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risks, as well as to manage changing business needs. \n \nWhile we restrict the use of third-party and open-source AI tools, such as ChatGPT, our employees and consultants may use these tools on an unauthorized basis and our partners may use these tools, which poses risks relating to the potential exposure of our proprietary confidential information to unauthorized recipients and the misuse of our or third-party intellectual property. AI tools may also produce inaccurate responses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product development or other business activities, which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective maintaining, training, monitoring and enforcement of appropriate policies and procedures governing the use of AI tools, and the results of any such use, by us or our partners.\n \nAI technology may also give rise to significant legal and regulatory liability. Governments around the world have adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws and regulations related to AI, including the European Union’s AI Act, and several U.S. government agencies have increased investigations and enforcement efforts related to the use of AI technology, which could increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to use AI in the development of our products and in our operations. While the incoming U.S. administration has signaled that AI policy will be a priority, the scope and impact of any such policies cannot yet be determined. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any legal or regulatory requirement could subject us to legal liability, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n \nWe are subject to various U.S. and international laws, policies and other regulations regarding data protection.\n \nPrivacy, cyber security, and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues. To address these issues, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Cyber Security Law”), which took effect on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data, among other things. On June 10, 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Data Security Law”), which became effective on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in China, which becomes a key supplement to the Cyber Security Law and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision, transaction and publication of any kind of data. Various Chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely. For example, the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), took effect on November 1, 2021. PIPL is aimed at protecting and controlling the use and transfer of personal data in China. There is significant uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce the law, and it contains provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from China’s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border transfers of personal data. \n \nEffective May 25, 2018, the European Union (“EU”) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of EU data protection law to non-European Union entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal data of EU subjects. The GDPR allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use, disclose or secure the personal data of EU subjects, including through a data security breach. In addition, an increasing number of states in the U.S. have enacted laws containing similar requirements to the GDPR for businesses collecting or processing personal data. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was significantly amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and sets forth comprehensive privacy and security obligations regarding the collection and processing of personal data of eligible California residents. Other states have, or are expected to, enact similar or more expansive legislation regarding the collection and processing of personal data.\n\n These regulatory requirements may increase our costs of compliance. Any failure to fully comply with the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law, PIPL, GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant fines and regulatory corrective actions, along with reputational damage or third-party lawsuits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, data security breaches experienced by us could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive commercial data, and the exposure of personal data (including sensitive personal data) of our employees, customers, suppliers and others. Such incidents could subject us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution, and cause us to lose customers and their related revenue in the future.\n \n    21 \n\n  \n\nRisks Associated with Strategic Investments and Initiatives\n \nOur success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development. We may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\n \nOur success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources in research and development. We expect to continue investing heavily in research and development in the future in order to keep innovating and introducing new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. Increased investments in research and development will increase our operating expenses and may divert investment from other areas of our business, which may negatively impact our operating results, and we may not achieve the return on these investments that we anticipate, or be able to reduce such expenses in a timely manner if we experience a downturn in sales. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n In addition, if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase further. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could be harmed. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we have and are able to invest substantially greater amounts into research and development initiatives than we are, which could reduce the technological advances that we may be able to achieve and may harm our ability to compete. In order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development.\n \nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire. In addition, acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders, reduce our cash balances and/or cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. \n \nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, enhance our design capability or offer other business opportunities. As a result of completing acquisitions, we could use a significant portion of our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership, or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities. Such actions could impact our financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock.\n\n In addition, we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons, including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry, the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust or other policies, laws or regulations. If we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings.\n\n In January 2024, we completed the acquisition of Axign B.V. (“Axign”), a fabless semiconductor company located in the Netherlands that specializes in the development of consumer audio applications. We cannot guarantee that this or any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions. \n \nIf we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies, businesses or assets include those associated with:\n \n\n•   unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired companies or businesses;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   integrating the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   coordinating new product and process development;\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n•   hiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   undisclosed liabilities of the acquired businesses and potential legal disputes with founders or stockholders of acquired companies;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   our inability to commercialize acquired technologies;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   the projected business potential is not realized and as a result, we may be required to take an impairment charge related to goodwill or acquired intangibles that would impact our profitability;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   difficulties in assessing the fair value of earn-out arrangements;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n    22 \n\n  \n\nAlternatively, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. We will continue to consider, evaluate and negotiate any such transactions as our Board of Directors deems appropriate and in the best interest of our stockholders. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating, evaluating and negotiating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\n \nRisks Associated with Financial Reporting\n \nOur future worldwide tax rates, financial position and operating results may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws, interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts.\n \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% under the Pillar Two framework. Many countries have already implemented or are taking steps to implement Pillar Two. It is under each country’s own discretion to adopt Pillar Two. Many aspects of Pillar Two are effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, with certain impacts to be effective in 2025. Pillar Two could result in additional tax liability over the regular corporate tax liability in a particular jurisdiction to the extent that the effective tax rate is less than the minimum rate. The potential impact, if any, to our provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows could be materially impacted by the implementation of the Pillar Two in our international jurisdictions where we have significant business operations.\n \nIn 2024, one of our foreign subsidiaries was granted a ten-year tax incentive, beginning in tax year 2025. A deferred tax benefit of approximately $1.3 billion, net of $0.1 billion of valuation allowance, was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024 to reflect the estimated future reductions in cash tax paid in that jurisdiction associated with the incentive. In January 2025, the OECD released new Administrative Guidance on the application of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules affecting Pillar Two. If the new Administrative Guidance is adopted by the jurisdiction that granted the tax incentive, it may materially impact our global tax provision. We cannot predict the timing and how that foreign jurisdiction would adopt the new Administrative Guidance, or whether the OECD will release additional guidance in the future. \n \n Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items. In addition, we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and tax authorities in various jurisdictions where we have business operations. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n \n Our international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing, permanent establishment challenges and other local regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings and corporate tax rates among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our positions were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, resulting in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. \n \nThe challenging, subjective or complex judgments of certain accounting areas may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements.\nCertain areas of our accounting, including but not limited to our income tax provision and inventory reserves, require a significant amount of management judgments or could be complex. For example, due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision, including the effects of the enactment of new tax laws, we engage third-party tax advisors to assist us in the calculation. If we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future, we could be subject to errors, which, if material, would result in a restatement of our financial statements. Restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations, damage our reputation, and/or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\n \nWe face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting.\n Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct, our business and operating results could be harmed. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or have a negative impact on our reputation and the trading price of our common stock, and could subject us to stockholder litigation.\n \n    23 \n\n  \n\nAs more fully disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, a material weakness was identified in the audit of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which has been subsequently remediated as of December 31, 2024. We cannot provide assurance that we will not in the future identify new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements.\n \nRisks Associated with Regulatory Compliance, Intellectual Property Protection and Litigation\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. While the new U.S. administration has suspended the commencement of new investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA, the FCPA remains in effect and it is uncertain whether enforcement actions and investigations will re-commence or whether the law will be changed or re-interpreted. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all the time or protect us against liability under these laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We have significant operations in Asia, which place us in frequent contact with individuals who may be considered “foreign officials” under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, resulting in an elevated risk of potential violations. If we are not in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including restatements of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation or allegations of any potential violations of anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers, we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\n Our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the U.S. and other countries we conduct business in, including export control laws such as the Export Administration Act, the Export Administration Regulations and other laws, regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance.\n \nEnvironmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, including various EU member countries and countries in Asia. There can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs, possible delays in delivering products, and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the costs were to become prohibitive. \n \nWe are subject to increasing regulatory and reporting standards related to ESG matters, which could increase our expenses.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in public awareness and requirements from regulators, investors, customers and other key stakeholders focusing on ESG compliance efforts, including those related to environmental sustainability and social responsibility. For example, in October 2023 and September 2024, California passed several bills that will require companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions data and climate-related financial risks. We are also subject to increasing regulatory and compliance requirements related to labor and human rights within our supply chain, including the responsible sourcing of conflict minerals and the prohibition of conducting business with certain suppliers under the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In addition, many of our customers increasingly include stringent environmental and other non-standard compliance requirements in their contracts with us or request significant amount of data from us for their Scope 3 emissions reporting and supply chain compliance. While we are committed to maintaining strong ESG strategies, practices, policies and disclosures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goals, or that our compliance initiatives and efforts will be deemed sufficiently robust by regulators, stockholders, customers and other key stakeholders. The achievement of our goals and initiatives may be impacted by factors that are outside our control. Some of our stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives, and the focus and views of our stakeholders may change and evolve over time and vary depending on the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, implement new initiatives, comply with federal, state or international laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and views, could result in litigation, regulatory action or other legal claims, penalties, injunction or other remedies against us, damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n Furthermore, our compliance efforts, including the collection, assessment and reporting of ESG data, are subject to evolving reporting standards and can be costly, complex and time-consuming. In addition, climate change concerns and the potential associated environmental impact, as well as labor and human rights issues, could result in the proposal and passage of additional laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that may affect us, our suppliers and customers. Such laws and regulations could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, and failure to comply with the regulatory standards in a timely manner could result in penalties and fines. These operational, legal, compliance and other risks could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n  24 \n\n  \n\nGiven our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise, our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter, and we could be liable for significant damages or other expenses, which could harm our stock price and financial condition.\n Historically, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding. It is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter, which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations, and the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings, including any damages we might incur is difficult to predict. We may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings, which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses or we are found liable for significant damages or other expenses, our stock price and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n \nFuture legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves, and in some circumstances our key customers or suppliers, against infringement claims. Such litigation is very costly. Further, in connection with these legal proceedings, we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time, until such dispute is resolved. If our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts, our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses, we may have to cease production of certain products, design around such technologies, or pay royalty payments to license technology, any of which could harm our financial condition and our business. Our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings, which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations, which could adversely affect our business.\n \nFailure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete.\n We rely heavily on our proprietary technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products. We pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies, and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. Despite the precautions we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies, including through patents. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\n \nIf we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers, we could be prevented from selling our products and/or be required to pay substantial damages. An unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages, attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results.\n From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings. If we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers, we could be ordered to pay monetary fines and/or damages, including expenses and damages against our customers. If we are found liable for willful patent infringement, damages could be significant. We and/or our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products. Moreover, our customers and end users could decide not to use our products, and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized. Finally, interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings. Even if resolved favorably, such proceedings can be very expensive and time consuming, and may divert management’s attention from other business operations.\n \nCertain software we use is from open-source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n We use open-source software in connection with certain of our products and services, and we intend to continue to use open-source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open-source software against companies that incorporate open-source software into their products or services or alleging that these companies have violated the terms of an open-source license. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or alleging that we have violated the terms of an open-source license. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software solutions with open-source software in certain circumstances, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to publicly release the source code of our proprietary software solutions, which could harm our business and ability to compete. If we inappropriately use open-source software, we may be required to re-engineer our solutions, discontinue the sale of our solutions, release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could increase our costs, harm our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There is also a risk that open-source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n \nRisks Associated with Human Capital Management\nThe loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business.\n Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. We are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives, including Michael Hsing, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology. In addition, personnel with highly skilled analog and mixed-signal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future. If we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business, including design cycles, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we lose key personnel, the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources, and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to effectively integrate into the team.\n \n  25 \n\n  \n\nIf we fail to retain key employees in our sales, engineering, finance and legal functions or to make continued improvements to our internal systems, our business may suffer.\nIf we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales, engineering, financial and legal functions, maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business, we may not be able to effectively execute our business strategy. The operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees, as they hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and, if they were to terminate their employment, our sales, operations and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected.\n \nRisks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock\n \nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.\n The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n•                    actual or anticipated results of operations and financial performance, including our ability to accurately forecast future demand for our products;                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n•   actual or anticipated manufacturing capacity limitations;                                                                                                                             \n•   our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity;\n•   our ability to maintain or increase our gross margins;

                                                                               \n•   the loss of, or a material reduction in sales to, our key customers, or rumors with respect thereto;                                                                                  \n•   investments in sales and marketing resources to enter new markets;                                                                                                                    \n•   commencement of or developments relating to litigation;                                                                                                                               \n•   cyberattacks or other system security, data protection and privacy breaches;                                                                                                          \n•   the inclusion, exclusion or deletion of our common stock from any major trading indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index;                                                               \n•   our sale of common stock or other securities in the future;                                                                                                                           \n•   any mergers, acquisitions or divestitures of assets undertaken by us;                                                                                                                 \n•   our ability to obtain governmental licenses and approvals for international trading activities or technology transfers, including export licenses;                                    \n•   our ability to meet or exceed the guidance that we provide to our investors and analysts;                                                                                             \n•   the extent to which we execute the stock repurchase program and continue payment of quarterly cash dividends to stockholders;                                                         \n•   our ability to meet or exceed our, investors’ or analysts’ expectations;                                                                                                              \n•   market reactions to guidance from other semiconductor companies or third-party research groups;                                                                                       \n•   market reactions to merger and acquisition activities in the semiconductor industry, and rumors or expectations of further consolidation in the industry;                             \n•   investor perceptions of us and our business strategies;                                                                                                                               \n•   the breadth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;                                                                                                                         \n\n•   trading activity in our common stock, including short positions;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n    26 \n\n  \n\n\n•                          actions by institutional or other large stockholders;

                                                                                                                                                                                 \n•   government policies and regulations on international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods;                                                                            \n•   export controls, trade and economic sanctions and regulations, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets, particularly in China;\n•   ratings published by third-party organizations with respect to our ESG compliance efforts;                                                                                                                      \n•   our compliance with regulatory mandates focusing on ESG issues, including climate risks and social initiatives; and                                                                                             \n•   our performance against the ESG guidelines set by institutional stockholders and customers, and our ability to meet or exceed their expectations.                                                               \n \nIn addition, the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n \nIf securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If we fail to meet the expectations of these analysts, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n \nShort positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock.\n Historically, there have been “short” positions in our common stock. The anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline. Such stock price decreases could encourage further short-sales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price. This could lead to further increases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause decreases and volatility in our stock price. The volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder’s investment to decline rapidly. Additionally, if our stock price declines, it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business.\n \n  27 \n\n  \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\n We have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and on the return achieved by our stockholders. \n \nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n \nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock. The repurchase program will expire in February 2028. The amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on market conditions and our priorities for the use of our cash. We are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable, or at all. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\n \nIf we issue additional shares of stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\n We may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition. Any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may require additional regulatory compliance, such as stockholder approval.\n \nGeneral Risk Factors\n \nOur worldwide operations are subject to economic and geopolitical uncertainty and risks associated with business continuity in the event of natural or other disasters including pandemics, war, climate crises and other natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\n \n Our offices in California and Washington, the production facilities of our third-party wafer suppliers, our IC testing and manufacturing facilities, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Much of our revenue, as well as our manufacturing and assembly partners, are concentrated in Asia, particularly in China. Such concentration increases the risk that earthquakes or other natural disasters, labor strikes, epidemics and pandemics, and/or health advisories could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, China experienced a severe heatwave during the summer months in the Sichuan province, which resulted in widespread power shortages, rolling backouts and temporary business shutdowns imposed by the local governments. Although we were able to successfully execute our contingency plan and our operations were not materially and adversely disrupted by the events, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the operational risks caused by extreme weather conditions or other events. \n \n In addition, we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively. Any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruptions. System-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n \nFurthermore, worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The U.S. and other regions where we conduct business have been and may continue to be affected by conflicts that could, among other things, disrupt our supply chain, and impact customer demands and component prices. For example, the U.S. and other countries have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures on Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine. Although such measures have not significantly affected our business or operations, future developments could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n \n  28",
