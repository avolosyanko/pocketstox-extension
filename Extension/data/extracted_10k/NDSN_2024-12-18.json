      "text": "Item 1.  Business\nGeneral Description of Business\nNordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulas, medical balloons and medical tubing. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, precision agriculture, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing.\nOur strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers’ needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 67 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2024.\nAs of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,000 employees worldwide. Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nCorporate Purpose and Goals\nWe strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.\nWe operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies.\nWe focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences.\nIn 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS (\"Nordson Business System\") Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values. \nThe NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities. \nWe drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies and leveraging existing technology into new applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology-based product portfolios, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers.\nWe strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction – it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business.\nComplementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department’s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and \nNordson Corporation 4\n\n\nprofessional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see \"Human Capital Resources\" below.\nWe recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives.\nWe are an equal opportunity employer.\nAt Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to contributing up to five percent of domestic pretax earnings to education, human welfare services and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation, we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing approximately 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally through our 2:1 employee Matching Gifts, as well as community giving programs in ten international locations. Since 1989, we have donated more than $173 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 113,000 hours through our Time ‘N Talent and Dollars for Doers programs. \nPrincipal Products and Uses\nWe are a diversified precision technology company that engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. Our precision technology can be found in manufacturing facilities around the world producing a wide range of goods for consumer durable, consumer non-durable, medical and technology end markets. Equipment ranges from single-use components to manual, stand-alone units for low-volume operations to microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines.\nWe market our products globally, primarily through a direct sales force, and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives. We have built a worldwide reputation for creativity and expertise in the design and engineering of high-technology application equipment that meets the specific needs of our customers. We create value for our customers by developing solutions that increase uptime, enable faster line speeds and reduce consumption of materials. We serve a broad customer base, both in terms of industries and geographic regions. In 2024, no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of our sales.\nThe following is a summary of the product lines and markets served by our operating segments:\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nThis segment delivers proprietary dispensing and material processing technology, as well as measurement, inspection and control solutions to diverse end markets. Product line specific solutions reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency and enhance product quality and appearance.

Headquartered in Allen, Texas, Atrion is a manufacturer of proprietary medical products and generated approximately $169 million in annual revenue in 2023. Established in 1944, Atrion supports customers globally through three FDA registered U.S. Food and Drug Administration manufacturing facilities located in the United States. Atrion’s portfolio is included in the Company's Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. It consists of three key businesses that we believe will significantly expand Nordson’s addressable market in infusion and cardiovascular therapies: \n•Halkey Roberts is a leader in infusion fluid delivery solutions, including single-use original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") medical components such as swabable needle free and pressure relief valves. \n•Atrion Medical is a leading provider of OEM interventional inflation devices for balloon catheterization, stent deployment and fluid delivery in structural heart, ears, nose and throat and gastrointestinal procedures. \n•Quest Medical’s highly differentiated myocardial protection devices and single-use consumables deliver real-time precise drug administration during cardiovascular surgery. \nAdvanced Technology Solutions\nThis segment integrates our proprietary product technologies into the progressive stages of a customer’s production processes, such as surface treatment, precisely controlled dispensing of material and pre- and post-dispense test and inspection to ensure quality. This segment predominantly serves customers in the electronics end markets.\n•Electronics Systems – Automated dispensing systems for high-speed, accurate application of a broad range of attachment, protection and coating fluids, and related gas plasma treatment systems for cleaning and conditioning surfaces prior to dispense. Key strategic markets include the breadth of the electronics industry manufacturing supply chain that produces semiconductor, printed circuit board assemblies and electronic components.\n•Test and Inspection – Bond testing and automated optical, acoustic microscopy and x-ray inspection systems used in the semiconductor and printed circuit board industries. Key strategic markets include mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, wearable technology, liquid crystal displays, micro hard drives, microprocessors, printed circuit boards, flexible circuits, micro mechanical systems and semiconductor packaging.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Other Resources \nOur production operations include machining, molding and assembly. We manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment. Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and \nNordson Corporation 6\n\n\nsources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Alabama and Wisconsin; as well as in the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nPrincipal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. Most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods.\nWe monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, financial stability and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve service and manage compliance requirements and the cost effectiveness of our products may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.\nSenior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes.\nNatural gas, electricity and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed.\nWe continue to see a stabilization of the global supply chain, improved lead times and lower inflation risk. We enhanced our risk mitigation and sourcing efforts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Logistics flows have improved, and global forwarding rates have returned closer to pre-pandemic levels, except for Asia-origin shipments, which continue to be more volatile. We continue to see moderate rate increases on parcel and domestic trucking activity. \nIntellectual Property \nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole. \nSeasonal Variation in Business\nHistorically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs. Accordingly, fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. \nCompetitive Conditions\nWe operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality.\nNordson Corporation 7\n\n\nMany factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as global service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage.\nCompliance with Governmental Regulations\nOur global operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and compliance obligations relating to the manufacturing, designing and servicing of highly complex products and solutions. Examples of such regulations include, but are not limited to, import and export controls, data privacy, environmental, product safety, corruption, bribery, employment and labor. To support our policy of compliance in every jurisdiction we do business, we have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe transact with customers and suppliers in numerous geographies around the world and are required to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. import, export and sanctions laws (collectively “Trade Laws”). We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of Trade Laws, and we regularly monitor and adjust our programs and training to reflect changes in Trade Laws or changes in our business. Geopolitical events may result in changes to Trade Laws that may impact our ability to transact business involving certain countries, certain items or certain counterparties, or may impose additional costs or complexity relating to tariffs, taxes, duties or adjustments to our compliance programs, training, or personnel requirements.\nWe are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risks of fines and penalties. Additionally, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance.\nWe are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate.\nWe believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs or legal claims related to environmental regulations, and we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated.\nWe believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material regulation or compliance obligations arising from our operations. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign regulation and laws during 2024 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot guarantee that material liabilities may not arise from regulation and compliance obligations in the future.\nNordson Corporation 8\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources \nEmployee Profile\nAs of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 8,000 employees. \nTotal Rewards\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population. \nIn the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the “Savings Plan”) for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6% of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3% eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3% each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Salaried Pension Plan”). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55% of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried Pension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Hourly Pension Plan”). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees’ retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan (“Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan”), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible officers hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code. \nIn 2022, we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed, as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift, gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity. We also continue our service award program, which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog.\nTalent\nOur key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, personal and professional growth opportunities, and a rewarding employee experience. We strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge, appreciation and success. We believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.\nTalent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities. \nOne of our core values—Respect for People—reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skill-building, intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity. Nordson’s employee resource groups strengthen our commitment to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace where everyone feels like they belong. Participation in these groups is open to all employees. We regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs, including at the executive leadership and Board levels. \nNordson Corporation 9\n\n\nAvailable Information\nOur annual report, quarterly reports and current reports (Form \"8-K\") and amendments to those reports filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge at https://investors.nordson.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

      "text": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors\nIn an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized. Additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the Company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nChanges in United States or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the revenue stream and profitability of any of our operations.\nIn 2024, approximately 33 percent of our revenue was generated in the United States, while approximately 67 percent was generated outside the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and may continue to do so in future periods.\nA general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. Our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. A slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability.\nA portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing, agriculture, and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. The demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. Downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or markets may reduce sales of some of our products. It is not possible to accurately predict the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future.\nAny significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event or conditions, including inflationary pressures, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. We cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery.\nOur financial results have been, and could continue to be, significantly impacted by uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments.\nOur ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the “United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement” with Mexico and Canada, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. For example, the incoming U.S. presidential administration has proposed to significantly increase tariffs on foreign imports into the United States, particularly from Canada, China and Mexico. Other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our financial results. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy.\nNordson Corporation 10\n\n\nSignificant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the United States dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nA significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2024 were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the United States dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where applicable, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the impact of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\"Brexit\") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Future adverse consequences arising from the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and Brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. Any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into United States dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations diminish the United States dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nPolitical conditions in and between the United States and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the United States. We expect that international operations and United States export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•risks of political or economic instability;\n•unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n•threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East;\n•changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws that impact how United States multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings;\n•restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n•potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n•the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n•the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the U.S. presidential administration; and\n•exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country. \nAny of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nOur international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other \nNordson Corporation 11\n\n\ntrade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. The incoming U.S. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.\nWe regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.\nIncreased information technology threats and cybersecurity incidents and threats could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services and those of our business partners.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and some cybersecurity incidents to our systems and networks. We do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of past cybersecurity incidents, have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the company, including our business, strategy, results of operations or financial condition. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party business partners. Increased global information technology security threats, computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity incidents and similar attacks vary in their form and can include the deployment of harmful malware or ransomware, denial-of-services attacks, and other attacks, which may affect business continuity and threaten the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our systems and information. Cybersecurity incidents can also include employee or personnel failures, fraud, phishing or other social engineering attempts or other methods to cause confidential information, payments, account access or access credentials, or other data to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Cybersecurity threat actors also may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in software including software commonly used by companies in cloud-based services and bundled software. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cybersecurity incident or failure or disruption relating to our information or systems or that of our third-party business partners, or any failure by us or our third-party business partners to effectively address, enforce and maintain our information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity requirements may result in substantial harm to our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, alteration or corruption of data or systems, costs related to remediation or the payment of ransom, and litigation including individual claims or consumer class actions, commercial litigation, administrative, and civil or criminal investigations or actions, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigation and remediation costs and possible prolonged negative publicity.\nWe have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate \nNordson Corporation 12\n\n\nthese techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union’s GDPR and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe may face particular data protection and privacy risks in connection with the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other privacy laws and regulations. \nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws and other regulations, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personal information in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union’s GDPR and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. These laws and regulations may grant, among other things, individual rights to access and delete personal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information. These laws and regulations can also impose significant forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance and afford private rights of action to individuals under certain circumstances. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection laws and regulations, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our confidential or sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. Any failure to manage data privacy in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant regulatory investigations, fines, and sanctions, consumer and class action litigation, commercial litigation, prolonged negative publicity, data breaches, declining customer confidence, loss of key customers, employee liability and other unfavorable consequences.\nA disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation or the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies. The conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. Shortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along price increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature (including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change), pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost or decreased sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, \nNordson Corporation 13\n\n\ncopyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. Further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business. \nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nRisks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nInnovation is critical to our success. We believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. We also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. For example, in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Atrion. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new \nNordson Corporation 14\n\n\nmarkets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, including the recent acquisitions of Atrion, the ARAG Group (\"ARAG\") and CyberOptics Corporation (\"CyberOptics\"), once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:\n•our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;\n•diversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n•difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;\n•difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;\n•adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;\n•the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and\n•the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing.\nIn addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of incurring acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax or other liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition. \nWe may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.\nAny impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. In addition, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in United States and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. While we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nNordson Corporation 15\n\n\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. \nThe level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us. \nOur operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions, including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations and how the Company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.\nOur global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements, and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nChanges in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIt is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our ESG goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our ESG Report. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of \nNordson Corporation 16\n\n\nstakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where ESG focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur inability to comply with the restrictive covenants included in the agreements governing our debt or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing debt.\nThe limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities.\nThe agreements governing our existing debt contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n•borrow money or guarantee the debts of others;\n•use assets as security in other transactions;\n•make restricted payments or distributions; and\n•sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies.\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial ratios, including a “Leverage Ratio” and an “Interest Coverage Ratio,” both as defined in the credit facilities.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the agreements governing our debt will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates.\nWe may need to obtain new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing debt. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing debt. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Finally, if financial market conditions worsen, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect us.\nAny period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. As of October 31, 2024, we had $2,223,928 of total debt outstanding, of which $538,286 was priced at interest rates that float with the market. As of October 31, 2024, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in approximately $5,383 of additional annual interest expense. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nNordson Corporation 17\n\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.\nWhile we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",
