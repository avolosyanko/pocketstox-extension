      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nSailPoint, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as appropriate, “SailPoint,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”) delivers solutions to enable comprehensive identity security for the enterprise. We do this by unifying identity data across systems and identity types, including employee identities, non-employee identities, and machine identities. Our SaaS and customer-hosted offerings leverage intelligent analytics to provide organizations with critical visibility into which identities currently have access to which resources, which identities should have access to those resources, and how that access is being used. Our solutions enable organizations to establish, control, and automate policies that help them define and maintain a robust security posture and achieve regulatory compliance. Powered by AI, our solutions enable organizations to overcome the scale and complexity of managing identities in real-time across dynamic, complex IT environments.\nThe evolving threat landscape requires a more comprehensive identity security approach than ever before. The number of cyber attacks continues to increase at an accelerating rate, fueled in part by the adoption of AI by threat actors. In 2023, 90% of organizations surveyed experienced an identity-related incident according to Identity Defined Security Alliance. In June 2024, a significant volume of data was stolen via compromised login credentials from customers of a data warehouse, including data from a large ticketing company and a major bank. Hacking groups extensively use compromised identities in their operations, conducting spear-phishing campaigns to access email accounts, harvesting multifactor authentication codes, and leveraging compromised service accounts to infiltrate victims. Once compromised, insufficiently governed identities enable attacks to access sensitive applications and data, presenting a significant risk to organizations.\nIdentity security is complicated by an evolving and increasingly complex IT environment. Increasingly distributed and remote workforces, the proliferation of infrastructure as a services and SaaS applications, and an explosion of data have significantly contributed to this new IT paradigm. Non-employee and machine identities, AI-enabled or otherwise, are driving a significant expansion in the number and scope of identities that organizations must manage.\nOrganizations lack both the people and expertise needed to manage complex ecosystems, and the personnel and skills gap is widening as identity sprawl continues to proliferate. These factors are further exacerbated by regulatory trends toward greater data privacy requirements, leading organizations to demand more effective solutions for managing identity and data security risk.\nWe believe identity is core to enterprise security. We pioneered the market for enterprise identity governance almost two decades ago, and our leadership in the sector has been recognized by independent research firms. From this foundation, we have evolved our offerings to address the most challenging dimensions of identity security today.\nDuring our nearly 20-year history, we have continuously evolved our offerings to address the most pressing challenges in identity security. We offer multiple identity solutions to meet the diverse needs of our customers across a full range of deployment options. The SailPoint Identity Security Cloud is built on our unified Atlas platform and enables organizations to consume our identity solution as a SaaS offering. IdentityIQ is our customer-hosted identity security solution and meets the needs of organizations that are not able or ready to implement a SaaS solution.\nOur Identity Security Cloud, built on Atlas, enables organizations to deliver the critical elements needed to build, maintain, and scale a strong, enterprise-class, identity security environment. Our solutions address nearly all types of systems and identities, including data and applications, employee identities, non-employee identities, and machine identities, and enable smarter access decisions, improve business processes, and provide deeper understanding of identity and access.\nOur solutions are underpinned by several key differentiators:\n•Our modular, extensible, and scalable Atlas platform, with its unified architecture and deep integration capability, provides us with the foundation for continued product innovation;\n•Our Identity Cube provides a 360-degree view of every enterprise identity, enabling a multidimensional approach to access management that encompasses various aspects of identity such as attributes, entitlements, and effective permissions; and\n3\n\n\n•Our use of AI and automation throughout our platform enhances decision-making, accelerates risk detection, and delivers seamless integrations.\nOur customers include many of the world’s largest and most complex organizations, including large enterprises across all major verticals and governments. Our go-to-market approach consists primarily of tailored customer engagement strategies by market segment, which we believe is critical to ensuring successful implementation and ongoing customer success. Most new customers purchase one of our SaaS suites. We focus on expanding our customer relationships over time with significant up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, including suite upgrades and additional products.\nOur Growth Strategy\nDrive New Customer Growth\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to accelerate the growth of our customer base as countless organizations still use a combination of legacy solutions and home-grown tools. We estimate that over 60% of organizations in our target market still have a fragmented identity experience or use a mostly manual process based on our internal research. To continue to grow our customer base, we intend to enhance our marketing efforts, increase our sales capacity and productivity, and expand and further leverage our use of channel partners.\nExpand Existing Customer Relationships\nOur customer base of approximately 2,975 organizations, as of January 31, 2025, provides significant expansion opportunities. The evolving threat landscape, increasing complexity of the IT environment, and number and scope of identities require a more comprehensive identity security approach than ever before. As our customers adopt new technologies such as AI, continue to add non-employee and machine identities, and implement more comprehensive identity security strategies, we see a substantial opportunity to increase our relationships with existing customers through the increased adoption of our solutions. We have invested in enhancing our solutions by organically adding capabilities including data access governance, activity management, application onboarding, identity threat detection, and response and cloud identity entitlement management as well as inorganically adding non-employee risk management and privilege access governance through our acquisitions of SecZetta and Osirium.\nContinue to Leverage and Expand Network of Partners and Alliances\nOur go-to-market partners and alliances help us extend our reach, serve our customers more effectively, and expand our addressable market. We see a significant opportunity to increase the number of customers we can serve through our systems integrator and managed service proMSP partnerships. Additionally, our technology alliance partners help us extend our reach throughout a customer’s IT environment with integrations with products like Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\"), CyberArk, Proofpoint, SAP, and ServiceNow.\nExpand our Global Footprint\nToday, we offer our solutions in more than 60 countries. During the years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, we generated 32% of our revenue from outside of the United States. We believe there is a significant opportunity to deepen our existing global footprint and drive incremental sales and new client acquisitions in new territories by leveraging our existing relationships with global system integration and channel partners.\nContinue to Innovate and Expand Our Portfolio\nWe built a reputation as an innovator and leader in identity security. We recently launched new offerings in non-employee risk management, data access security, access risk management, and cloud infrastructure entitlement management. We are investing in AI, both to increase the capabilities of our solutions, as well as to help our customers protect their organizations while adopting AI for their own use cases. We intend to continue investing to extend our position as the leader in identity security by developing or acquiring new products and technologies and extending our portfolio into additional identity security use cases.\nOur Products\n4\n\n\nIdentity Security Cloud\nSailPoint Identity Security Cloud is our cloud-based identity security solution, which allows organizations to centrally discover, manage, and secure all enterprise identity types, and the data and cloud infrastructure associated with them. This offering is built on Atlas, our unified, extensible, multi-tenant SaaS platform. The Atlas platform enables Identity Security Cloud to unify several capabilities into a single pane of glass and is extensible to allow for the development of new capabilities and modules over time. Throughout our SaaS transformation, we were intentional in taking a longer and more expensive path, decomposing logic that held key intellectual property and rebuilding those same components in a new scalable micro-services-based architecture, to ensure our ability to maximize customer value into the future. Atlas serves as the foundation for SailPoint Identity Security Cloud and delivers the critical elements needed to build, maintain, and scale a strong, enterprise-class identity security program. The platform is designed to utilize AI to enable rapid development and easy integration into new capabilities, acquired technologies, and customer environments.

Designed as an integrated SaaS solution with Identity Security Cloud, our Data Access Security offering delivers enhanced intelligence on critical data to improve data security posture, reduce risk, and streamline compliance efforts. With this offering, security teams are able to proactively uncover and remediate hidden data risks with automated data discovery and classification, built-in governance workflows, and out-of-the-box governance policies, increasing their productivity and radically improving their visibility into pivotal organization data.\n•Password Management: Provides business users an intuitive, self-service experience for managing and resetting passwords from any device and from anywhere, reducing the reliance on IT and security staff, and enforcing greater password security. Our Password Management offering enforces consistent and secure password policies for all users across all systems from the cloud to the data center by detecting password changes initiated outside of the Identity Security Cloud and synchronizing them to maintain a stronger organization-wide password security posture. Offering a self-service model, business users are able to reset, change, or recover passwords, allowing them to stay connected and productive while enhancing the security of the broader organization.\n•Access Risk Management: Enables organizations to eliminate fraud, optimize compliance processes, and ensure audit readiness by unifying identity security controls and Separation of Duties monitoring across enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") and other apps in the business ecosystem. Our offering effectively centralizes access risk governance by providing seamless GRC integration and extensive enterprise visibility to forecast and prevent Separation of Duties violations across an organization’s ERP systems such as SAP. With Access Risk Management, organizations can automate access reviews, document risk mitigation controls, oversee emergency access, conduct proactive risk simulations, and effortlessly maintain compliance to reduce audit deficiencies and breaches.\n•Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (\"CIEM\"): Empowers organizations to extend identity security to their cloud infrastructure, including AWS, Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”), and Microsoft Azure, to ensure compliance and security throughout their entire technology ecosystem. CIEM enables customers to discover, manage, govern, and remediate enterprise cloud infrastructure access with a single approach, gaining deeper understanding of their cloud resources and better visibility into their business user’s cloud privileges. Leveraging AI, CIEM enables cloud resource entitlement permissioning, not only on an access level, but on an action level, determining a business users' ability to read, write, and administrate cloud data.\n•Privileged Task Automation: Enables organizations to automate and delegate the execution of repeatable privileged tasks. Privileged task automation (“PTA”) allows users to execute common privileged tasks without sharing privileged credentials or the need for a privileged session by providing a centralized repository, low-code automation, and out-of-the-box templates for privileged task workflows. With PTA, organizations can reduce their reliance on advanced privileged access capabilities and empower general IT staff to provide better service, accelerate adoption, and improve productivity.\n•Machine Identity Security: Enables organizations to achieve governance, compliance, and security outcomes for machine accounts. With machine identity security (“MIS”), organizations can discover, classify, assign, certify, and oversee ownership of service accounts, bots, and other machine accounts with minimal configuration adjustments and without extensive manual processes. MIS consolidates the securing of machine accounts to allow for full lifecycle coverage and reduces the risk of orphaned or unmanaged accounts. With an intuitive interface, MIS can assign human owners, periodically and consistently review configuration, and remain compliant across their IT infrastructure while safeguarding critical systems.\nIdentityIQ\nIdentityIQ is our customer-hosted identity security solution providing large, complex customers, who are highly interested in data localization in territories where we do not host our cloud software, a unified and highly configurable identity security solution. While many organizations have migrated to a cloud hosted solution for the majority of their enterprise software needs, we recognize there is a limited set of customers who remain in need of a self-hosted solution and maintain our IdentityIQ solution to continue to provide service for those customers. IdentityIQ consistently applies business and security policies as well as role and risk models across applications and data on premises or hosted in the cloud. IdentityIQ allows organizations to empower users to request and gain access to enterprise applications and data while managing compliance using automated access certifications and policy management.\nSimilar to our Identity Security Cloud offering, we package and price IdentityIQ into capabilities with unique functionality, including:\n6\n\n\n•Lifecycle Manager\n•Compliance Manager\n•Connectors and Integrations: Provides organizations with the ability to connect to applications, mainframes, cloud infrastructure, and data sources from across a hybrid IT environment to centrally manage and control access, enforce consistent policies, and understand risks. Connectivity to additional mission-critical software and systems provides essential visibility into an organizations entire IT ecosystem and provides our IdentityIQ customers with the integrated functionality necessary to effectively address the vast number of applications incorporated into the modern enterprise stack.\nIn addition to the core IdentityIQ capabilities, organizations can extend the value of the solutions with additional products, including:\n•File Access Manager: Secures access to the growing amount of data stored in file servers, collaboration portals, mailboxes, and cloud storage systems to equip organizations with the ability to quickly identify and mitigate compliance and data risks. File Access Manager helps organizations identify where sensitive data resides, who has access to it, and how they are using it—and then puts effective controls in place to secure it. By augmenting identity data from structured systems with data from unstructured data targets, organizations can more quickly identify and mitigate risks, spot compliance issues, and make the right decisions when granting or revoking access to sensitive data. Packaged and priced by target storage system, our File Access Manager product provides core capabilities such as data discovery and classification, policy controls, risk remediation, and compliance automation.\n•SailPoint AI: Proactively provides visibility at speed and scale to determine access needs and potential security breaches associated with risky access policy to optimize security management. Our SailPoint AI capability is built to provide our IdentityIQ customers with additional AI features, such as recommendations and role discovery, by leveraging elements of our Atlas platform to streamline management.\nTechnology\nOur organization has invested significant time and effort to remain a pioneer in innovation, continually emphasizing sophisticated and differentiated solutions to provide the best outcome for our customers. Our team has been highly intentional in our approach in addressing customer needs and have leveraged our extensive knowledge in advanced technology to address these in a differentiated and optimized manner. As the regulatory conditions evolve, and the threat environment introduces new demands and requirements, we view our technology as fundamental to the competitive advantage we hold in the market and our ability to maintain this moat in the future.\nUnified Platform\nOur Atlas platform allows customers to manage all types of identities and their access needs across all environments through a single pane of glass, providing the underlying infrastructure critical to powering our Identity Security Cloud. Our Atlas platform is the culmination of both years of investment and the expertise of our management and technical teams. Taking the lessons learned from our experiences with prior generation identity solutions, our engineers and architects designed a modern identity platform with internet scale, comprehensive cloud, hybrid, and customer-hosted environment coverage, and openness to optimize customers’ existing technology investments. This extensible, enterprise-grade platform is critical to enabling the management of not only employees, but also non-employees and machine identities, with varying levels of privilege, spanning cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure, SaaS applications, customer-hosted applications, and datacenter infrastructure such as servers and databases. Tools including AI, analytics, workflows, and app onboarding are embedded throughout our unified platform, powering enhanced decision making, differentiated insights, and frictionless automation. Our purpose-built platform provides the controls essential to govern and secure digital identities in today’s complex IT environments to support real-time, risk-based, and policy-driven management of the constantly evolving breadth and depth of enterprise identities, ensuring the right identities have access to the right data.\nKey features of the Atlas platform include: \n•Extensibility: Enables deep configuration across security systems, empowering customers to easily thread identity security across their ecosystem.\n7\n\n\n•Personalized insights & reporting: Personalized action-oriented insights and reporting putting the most important identity information at the fingertips of administrators, managers, and end users.\n•ML: Rich library of ML models designed for better-optimized enterprise identity security practices and improved decision-making.\n•Connectivity: Expansive library of application and resource connectors that allow organizations to consolidate all access and identity information into a single solution.\n•Event-driven orchestration: Automated simple and complex identity use cases through custom workflows and forms to reduce or eliminate manual intervention.\nUnified Data Model\nThe Identity Cube is a key element of our data layer, providing a 360-degree view on every identity. The Identity Cube provides a complete view of each identity, including attributes, entitlements, access rights, and risk scores. It is extensible by the customer to include data attributes that are relevant specifically to their organizations.\nIn an on-premise deployment scenario, the Identity Cube is a part of every IdentityIQ installation. As user data and other attributes are aggregated from enterprise HR systems, directories, and the like, the Identity Cube is populated. From there, core life cycle functions such as provisioning new accounts for users can be accomplished. The Identity Cube is an integral part of the product, not an add-on or optional module.\nIn a customer-hosted deployment scenario, the Identity Cube is also a part of every implementation and functions in the same way. The difference is architectural, with the Identity Security Cloud version of the Identity Cube being optimized for a multi-tenant, cloud native architecture. In addition, in the SaaS deployment scenario, there are additional data facilities available that, when combined with the Identity Cube, represent our unified data model.\nIn both scenarios, the Identity Cube utilizes insights of the complex dependencies between identities, applications, data, and activities to create specialized data models that understand the effective access of an identity, patterns, and the potential risk level, whether in the cloud or customer-hosted. The connective, scalable, configurable, and automated nature of our Identity Security Cloud and IdentityIQ solutions allows us to secure identities for the most complex global organizations across all industries with AI-based security tools that provide comprehensive, scalable, and fast identity security to solve the needs of modern organizations.\nThe operational data derived from the data layer is organized into structured tables that represent real-world entities and their relationships. SailPoint’s account correlation, orphan account management, and risk scoring capabilities allow security professionals and business managers to track who has access to what and how often they use it and to rectify risky or dated access. With the help of Identity Cube’s context and the data layer, operational and security systems can make informed decisions about access and perform key remediation and change requests on our identity platform via our standardized application program interfaces and software development kits.\nBoth our Identity Security Cloud and IdentityIQ offering leverage highly advanced technology, AI, and ML to maximize the value received by our customers and streamline their operations to provide a stronger identity security posture. We at SailPoint recognize the critical opportunity AI represents to the most scaled and complex enterprise organizations and are committed to partnering with our customers to continue to provide solutions incorporating these advanced technologies to improve identity security at enterprise scale. Our AI based solutions process petabytes of data daily and are scalable, adaptable, and cost-efficient and provide customers with enhanced detection, improved accuracy and efficiency, and an enhanced user experience that enable them to make better decisions faster. Our innovation and experience in this space is demonstrated not only by recently developed products, but by a track record of successful AI-based offerings brought to market over the course of the last several years. Four major areas of capabilities form our AI layer as well as several distinct AI-based applications:\n•Recommendations: Our intelligent AI-based recommendations streamline account creation, access requests based on user roles and organizational policies, and access certifications. This functionality helps both requestors and approvers make better decisions and ensures access rights are regularly reviewed and validated, significantly reducing organizational risk.\n8\n\n\n•Discovery: Our discovery capabilities automatically identifies and creates roles based on the actual access patterns of users, simplifying role creation and identifies access patterns to highlight potential security risks or misconfigurations. Launched in 2020, our Access Modeling offering based on the discovery engine significantly reduces the time required to build an organization’s access model, and just as importantly, keep it up to date through role and peer group discovery, low similarity outlier analysis, and common access creation.\n•Assistant: Our assistive technologies drive user engagement and seamless experiences with large language models. In 2023, we launched our generative AI entitlement descriptions, which address one of identity security’s pain points by automatically generating descriptions of application entitlements. Given the significant additional workload associated with description creation, many entitlements across the modern organization remain without a description, increasing the difficulty in determining the validity and necessity of requests or approvals.\n•Automation: Our automation capabilities streamline the onboarding of new applications by provisioning access and managing compliance related activities. This functionality significantly reduces the amount of time required to onboard the “long tail” of applications onto the Identity platform, accelerating ROI, decreasing time to value for customers, and improving security posture at the same time.\nOur AI layer utilizes a combination of open-source models that have been customized for our use cases, proprietary models, and third-party models hosted by third-party subprocessors. To mitigate potential risks of inaccuracy and algorithmic hallucinations resulting from our use of AI, we employ our ML platform to evaluate trained models against benchmark and real customer data prior to deployment and to monitor model predictions. We also incorporate human-in-the-loop into our processes, including with entitlement descriptions, to detect incorrect predictions and improve the model.\nExtensibility and Low-Code/No-Code Automation\nOur solutions provide flexible low-code workflows and no-code forms to extend our products. Customers have used our interactive drag-and-drop workflows to create processes that are executed millions of times a month to meet the unique needs of their business processes. For customers who need deeper customization, or bespoke integrations with other enterprise systems, our offerings provide a robust set of application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") and software development kits (“SDKs”), supported by a vibrant developer community and Developer Relations team. Customers can browse community-contributed extensions and add them to their existing solution.\nConnector Library and Ecosystem\nOur solutions offer connectivity to over 1,100 applications through their extensive connector library. In addition, customers have used this same library to connect to over 20,000 custom applications. Our solutions leverage AI technology to automatically map application data models to the SailPoint Identity Cube, dramatically reducing the “long tail” of application integration efforts that typically hinder identity deployments.\nMultitenant SaaS Architecture\nOur microservices-based SaaS model, coupled with our low-code/no-code capabilities and our abstracted SDKs means that customers can customize the Identity Security Cloud while always running the latest code—without the need to test new versions or re-implement changes. Competitors who have deployed single-tenant models still require customers to schedule upgrade windows and delay code pushes, which drives total cost of ownership.\nCustomers\nWe have a diverse global customer base with approximately 2,975 organizations in more than 60 countries as of January 31, 2025. Our customers include leading organizations in a diverse set of industries including financial services, media, energy and utilities, technology, life sciences, and healthcare, as well as government agencies and public universities and represent 51% of the Fortune 500 and 26% of the Forbes Global 2000.\nOur business is not dependent on any particular customer, and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended January 31, 2025, 2024, or for the period from August 16, 2022 to January 31, 2023 (Successor) and from the period from February 1, 2022 to August 15, 2022 (Predecessor).\nResearch and Development\n9\n\n\nInnovation is one of our core values, and it is at the heart of how we think and do business.

We believe that our extensive partnership network enables us to provide the most complete identity security solution to our customers.\nTechnology Partners\nThe SailPoint Technology Alliance Program is a technology partnering network that leverages familiar standards and methods that make it easy to share identity context and configure identity-specific policies across disparate systems. Program offerings include access to SailPoint SDKs and APIs, developer support, and cloud-based certification services. The program comprises over 120 technology and implementation partners and has produced over 100 certified integrations.\nWe have partnered with industry leaders across a spectrum of technologies that enable organizations to integrate their entire security, mobility, cloud, and applications infrastructure into our platform so that breaches can be better identified, mitigated, and contained and operations can be streamlined. Solutions from companies such as AWS, CyberArk, Proofpoint, SAP, and ServiceNow that are plugged into our open identity platform through APIs provide our customers value-added capabilities to build an identity-aware enterprise.\nSystem Integrators\nWe partner with many large and global system integrators including Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC, as well as many regional system integrators. The focus of our system integrators program is to deliver pipeline growth and bookings, to help partners drive self-sufficiency, and to foster transparency and collaboration through shared assets and resources. We have implemented joint business controls and metrics that provide a platform for discussion and partnership development and help us optimize our program and unified value proposition.\nValue-Added Resellers\nValue-added resellers, such as CDW, GuidePoint, NetBR, Optiv, and Softcat, bring product expertise and implementation best practices to our customers globally. They provide vertical expertise and technical advice in addition to reselling or bundling our software. Many of our reseller partners have been trained to demonstrate and promote our identity platform. Our reseller channel ranges from large companies to regional resellers in our markets and territories. Our reseller program is designed to scale growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience, and increase profitability as well as sales efficiency.\nManaged Security Service Providers\nWe partner with a growing number of MSPs, including Accenture, Simeio, Kommando, and MajorKey, to expand the reach of our direct sales organization. Our MSP channel augments our reach in market segments and territories. Our MSP partners offer our solutions, both packaged with a managed service and without. While this channel represents a small portion of our new annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") today, we believe continuing to build out this channel will be a driver of growth.\nEmployees, Culture, and Values\nOur core values are more than words on our website. They are a constant reminder that what we do for our customers is important, but how we do things is also critical. We call that doing things “the SailPoint way.”\nWe strive to incorporate our “Four I” core values throughout the entire employee life cycle:\n•Innovation: We develop creative solutions to real customer challenges;\n•Integrity: We deliver on the commitments we make;\n•Impact: We measure and reward results, not activity; and\n•Individuals: We value every person.\n12\n\n\nAs an organization that continues to rapidly grow and evolve, we look for feedback from our crew to stay on course. Our annual “Crew’s Views” global employee engagement survey gives us the data we need to focus on areas where we can make the most impact. Over each of the last three years that we conducted the survey, employee participation exceeded 75% and overall team member satisfaction exceeded 82%. Externally, we’ve been recognized as an employer of choice for parents and millennials. Since November 2021, we’ve been a certified “Great Place to Work,” and we’ve been noted as a Best Workplace in Texas five years in a row. We’ve also been noted as a Best Workplace in Technology and been featured on “Best Places to Work” lists from Glassdoor and Built In.\nAs we work to execute our growth strategy, we continue to invest in human capital resources that will sustain and fuel that growth. As of January 31, 2025, we had a total of 2,738 employees. While most organizations post-pandemic have reverted to requiring mandatory days in-office, we recognize that there’s no perfect one-size fits all solution. We have realized many benefits in allowing crew to continue working remotely, so we treat our people like adults and empower team leaders to get their crew members together when it makes sense. This approach supports crew wellbeing and reflects our commitment to providing an environment for all our team members to succeed and thrive. \nOur training and development efforts, built around our core values, are another key part of our human capital strategy. Our leaders go through specific training to ensure they are leading their teams with our values at the forefront of the decisions they make. Our annual performance review process allows team members to engage in meaningful discussions with their managers about their performance and development goals, and we also conduct pay equity reviews during our merit planning process. Additionally, our managers assess the growth potential of each team member through a standardized evaluation process, which provides actionable outputs to help develop and retain our high-potential employees. Through these and other training efforts, we support the development of our crew members in a way that promotes our growth and innovation.\nOur philanthropy committee comes up with innovative opportunities for crew to give back to the communities in which we work. For more than seven years, we have run an annual “Sailanthropitch” program, where charities deliver a Shark-Tank-style presentation about their organization. Crew members cast their votes for the organizations they connect to the most, and each organization walks away with a financial donation tied to the percentage of votes they received. Our SailPoint Cares program, which started as an opportunity to bring cross-functional crew together in different regions, has grown significantly in recent years, providing opportunities for teams to get together and donate their time and resources to support good causes across three core pillars: STEM & tech, crew engagement, and education. We also forge partnerships to increase our impact—whether through Path Forward, which supports caregivers who are returning to the workforce, SkillBridge, which connects returning service members to job training opportunities, or Code2College, which enables students who might not normally have access or exposure to exploring a career in STEM to gain hands-on experience in a paid internship.\nWhile we always seek the best talent to join SailPoint, we are also committed to growing talent. Our Sail-U program brings early career talent to our organization, where we provide them with the environment to learn and grow via structured training opportunities, engagement with leaders across the organization, and peer networking. We also offer a wealth of on-demand resources via our company intranet, The Dock, to support growth and development and drive performance. \nOffering a competitive compensation and benefits package is another critical part of our effort to attract and retain top talent. In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer team members comprehensive health, welfare, income protection and long-term savings benefits, incentive equity compensation, and incentive cash plans for eligible team members. Total compensation is designed to align with SailPoint’s business objectives and financial goals, and pay is differentiated for individuals based on relevant experience, impact, relative internal value and company performance. Variable compensation delivers pay aligned with company and individual performance, with more pay at risk at more senior levels. Leadership regularly discusses compensation and benefits strategies with the compensation and nominating committee of our board of directors (our \"Board\").\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive market characterized by constant change and innovation. Our competitors include large public companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle that offer identity solutions within their product portfolios, and identity centric solution providers, including CyberArk, Okta, and One Identity. There are also a number of smaller scale, regional, or specialist identity security solution providers that we compete with in certain situations. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:\n•Comprehensiveness of visibility to which identities have access to what across the IT environment;\n13\n\n\n•Reliability and effectiveness in defining and implementing identity security policies;\n•Flexibility to deploy identity security and administration as a SaaS or customer-hosted solution;\n•Adherence to government and industry regulations and standards;\n•Comprehensiveness and interoperability of the solution with other IT and security solutions;\n•Enterprise security, scalability, and performance;\n•Ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;\n•Quality and responsiveness of support organizations;\n•Total cost of ownership;\n•Ease of use; and\n•Customer experience.\nSome of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater name recognition, in some cases within particular geographic regions, and more extensive geographic presence than we do. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We face intense competition in our market, both from larger, well-established companies and from emerging companies, and we may lack sufficient financial and other resources to maintain and improve our competitive position.” However, we believe we compete favorably with our competitors based on all the factors above.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment proprietary information, and inventions assignment agreements, trademarks, and to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe control access to and use of our solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. As of January 31, 2025, we had 79 issued patents and 16 patent applications pending in the United States and eight issued patents and no patent applications pending internationally, in each case relating to certain aspects of our technology. Also as of January 31, 2025, the expiration dates of our issued patents ranged from 2025 to 2041. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology and Our Intellectual Property Rights—If we fail to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, or adequately enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights” for information regarding potential risks associated with our intellectual property and our ability to protect it.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are not currently a party to, nor is our property currently subject to, any material legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, and we are not aware of any such proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities.\nFacilities\nOur corporate headquarters in Austin, Texas, consists of approximately 165,000 square feet of space under a lease that expires in April 2029. We also have additional office space under traditional leases in Pune, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; and London, United Kingdom and under coworking arrangements in various locations in North America, Europe, and Asia.\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and anticipate that suitable additional space will be readily available to accommodate any foreseeable expansion of our operations.\n14\n\n\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including those relating to data privacy and security. Many of these laws, rules, and regulations are continually evolving, and we expect that we will continue to become subject to new laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual requirements, and other obligations in the United States, the European Union (\"EU\"), the United Kingdom (the \"UK\"), and other jurisdictions. A failure to comply with them could result in civil and criminal liabilities and enforcement actions, which could include fines, as well as claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial performance, and prospects. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.\nCompliance and Certifications\nWe are committed to protecting critical business information belonging to SailPoint and the customers and partners we serve. In support of this commitment, we maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 that extends to additional controls defined within ISO/IEC 27018:2019 focusing on protection of Customer Personal Data in the cloud.\nEven before the enactment of the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR\"), and the many privacy regulations since then, our customers have been focused on ensuring their personal information is handled with the upmost care. SailPoint is certified with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, demonstrating our commitment to privacy principles and regulations. In addition, we have Standard Contractual Clauses in place that apply to any restricted transfers of data from customers to SailPoint, transfers between SailPoint entities, and transfers to our subprocessors.\nOn a product level, our product certifications include SOC 1 Type 2, an examination of controls at a service organization relevant to entities’ internal control over financial reporting, and SOC 2 Type 2, which is a report on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. SailPoint has also published SOC 3 Reports, which similarly address controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.\nOn June 5, 2024, SailPoint achieved U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP\") Moderate ATO (Authority to Operate) for our SaaS-based solution, SailPoint Identity Cloud. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®) is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by providing a standardized approach to security and risk assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP empowers agencies to use modern cloud technologies, emphasizing the security and protection of federal information and accelerating the adoption of secure cloud solutions. As a FedRAMP-authorized cloud service provider (CSP), SailPoint meets the security requirements necessary to support the most sensitive federal agencies, critical infrastructure, and the defense industrial base at the moderate impact level.\nIn Australia, our SailPoint Identity Security Cloud has been assessed to the Information Security Registered Assessors Program’s (IRAP) PROTECTED level control requirements, which are based on controls identified in the Australian Signals Directorate and Australian Government Information Security Manual. This IRAP assessment is a prerequisite for many Australian government departments seeking to adopt platforms and tools from cloud service.\nOur compliance certifications demonstrate our commitment to the rigorous security and privacy measures taken to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of our customers’ data and the security of our platform.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 11120 Four Points Drive, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78726, and our telephone number at that address is (512) 346-2000.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects it to certain hazards and risks. A description of some of the material risks relating to the Company’s business activities is set forth below. Other risks are described in Part I, Item 1. “Business—Competition,” Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. The Company’s business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations and impair the Company’s ability to implement business plans. In that case, the market price of the Company’s common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Our revenue grew from $365.3 million to $793.9 million from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Our revenue growth may not continue at a level consistent with historical performance. We believe our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers;\n•our ability to, and the ability of our channel partners to, successfully deploy and implement our solutions, increase our existing customers’ use of our solutions, and provide our customers with excellent customer support;\n•our ability to hire and retain substantial numbers of marketing, research and development, and general and administrative personnel and expand our global operations;\n•our ability to develop our existing solutions and introduce new solutions; and\n•our ability to increase the number of our partners.\nIf we are unable to achieve any of these requirements, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nOur future revenues and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to acquire new customers, if our customers do not renew their arrangements with us, if we are unable to expand sales to our existing customers, or if we are unable to develop new solutions that achieve market acceptance.\nTo continue to grow our business, it is important that we continue to acquire new customers to purchase and use our solutions. Our success in adding new customers depends on numerous factors, including our ability to (i) offer a compelling identity security platform and solutions, (ii) execute an effective sales and marketing strategy, (iii) attract, effectively train, and \n16\n\n\nretain new sales, marketing, professional services, and support personnel in the markets we pursue, (iv) develop or expand relationships with channel partners, including system integrators, value-added resellers, technology partners, and MSPs, (v) expand into new geographies and vertical markets, (vi) deploy our platform and solutions for new customers, and (vii) provide quality customer support once deployed.\nIt is important to our continued growth that our customers renew their arrangements when existing contract terms expire. For Identity Security Cloud, our SaaS-based cloud solution, and IdentityIQ, our customer-hosted solution, our customers typically enter into three-year contracts with annual billing upfront. Our customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and term subscriptions, and our customers may decide not to renew these agreements with a similar contract period, at the same prices and terms, or with the same or a greater number of identities. Our customer retention and expansion are difficult to accurately predict and may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors. Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to expand our customer relationships over time through up-selling and cross-selling opportunities including suite upgrades and additional products. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers depends on several factors, including their experience with implementing and using our solutions and the existing products they have implemented, their ability to integrate our solutions with existing technologies, and our pricing model.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire new customers, retain our existing customers, expand sales to existing customers, or introduce new solutions, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected. The adverse effect on our financial results may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales, and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new solutions.\nIf our new solutions do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position could be impaired and our potential to generate new revenue or to retain existing revenue could be diminished. The adverse effect on our financial results may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales, and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new solutions, and we may not have the ability to introduce compelling new solutions that address the requirements of our customers in light of the dynamic identity security market in which we operate.\nAdditionally, if the incidence of cyber attacks were to decline, or enterprises or governments perceive that the general level of cyber attacks has declined, our ability to attract new customers could be adversely affected. We may face additional difficulties in attracting organizations that use legacy products to purchase our solutions if they believe that these legacy products are more cost-effective or provide a level of security that is sufficient to meet their needs. Furthermore, the use of our solutions to manage identities and access is relatively new, and if we are unable to convince organizations of the benefits of our solutions, then we may be unable to acquire new customers or keep existing customers.\nIf the market for identity security solutions does not grow, our ability to grow our business and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for identity security solutions. The market for identity security solutions, including our platform and identity security solutions, is rapidly evolving. As such, it is difficult to predict this market’s potential growth, if any, customer adoption and retention rates, customer demand for identity security platforms, or the success of competitive products. Any expansion in this market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platform and identity security solutions and similar solutions of our competitors, including preference to manage security with existing infrastructure security tools alone, rather than investing in a platform-based identity security solution. The markets for some of our solutions are new, unproven, and evolving, and our future success depends on growth and expansion of these markets. If our platform and identity security solutions do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for our platform and identity security solutions due to a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products or solutions, privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, our ability to market, sell, distribute, and implement our solutions will be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales influenced by, or made through, our channel partner network and expect these sales to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Our channel partners provide implementation and other services to our customers in exchange for fees paid by those customers. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from \n17\n\n\nour channel partners if we are unable to retain our existing channel partners and expand their sales or add additional motivated channel partners.\nOur arrangements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning they may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with our solutions and products. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our solutions, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell our competitors’ products or services, fail to meet the needs of our customers, or cease marketing our solutions or providing services to us, our ability to grow our business and sell our solutions may be adversely affected. Our channel partners may cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. In addition, certain of our channel partners are subject to independence requirements that have in the past or may in the future prevent them from providing services to us or cooperating with us in our go-to-market efforts if they also provide services for affiliates of our controlling stockholder, Thoma Bravo. If one or more of our channel partners determines that it is unable to both provide services to us or cooperate with us in our go-to-market efforts and also provide services to affiliates of our controlling stockholder, those channel partners may cease marketing our solutions or otherwise cease providing services to us or cooperating with us in our go-to-market efforts.\nWe also collaborate with adjacent technology vendors to offer comprehensive solutions to our customers. If we do not effectively collaborate with them, or if they elect to terminate their relationships with us or develop and market solutions that compete with our solutions, our growth would be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results tend to fluctuate from period-to-period, and we believe that our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of future performance. Period-to-period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below, many of which are outside of our control:\n•the mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to subscription and professional services, which may impact our gross margins and operating income;\n•the mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions and the associated volatility and timing of our transactions;\n•the mix of SaaS subscriptions compared to term subscriptions, which affects how we recognize revenue and may result in a decrease in gross margins as well as impact the results of our operations;\n•the loss or deterioration of our channel partner and other relationships influencing our sales execution;\n•the growth in the market for our solutions;\n•our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers;\n•changes in customers’ budgets and in the timing of their purchasing decisions, including seasonal buying patterns for IT spending;\n•the timing and success of new product introductions by our competitors and by us;\n•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n•significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to the delivery and use of our platform;\n•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment;\n•foreign exchange gains and losses related to expenses and sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or the functional currencies of our subsidiaries;\n18\n\n\n•increases in and timing of sales and marketing and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n•costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs;\n•our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n•the collectability of receivables from customers and channel partners, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers or channel partners experience financial distress;\n•economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n•natural disasters or other catastrophic events; and\n•litigation-related costs, settlements, or adverse litigation judgments.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our offerings makes it difficult to identify a regular cadence to our sales and the related revenue recognition. We and our channel partners are often required to spend significant time and resources to better educate and familiarize potential customers with the value proposition of our platform and solutions. Customers often view the purchase of our solutions as a strategic decision and significant investment and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test, and qualify our platform and solutions prior to purchasing our solutions. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which ultimately may not result in a sale. Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n•the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n•lengthy purchasing approval processes;\n•the evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process;\n•time, complexity, and expense involved in replacing existing solutions;\n•announcements or planned introductions of new products, features, or functionality by our competitors or of new solutions or modules by us;\n•the practice of large enterprises often driving their purchasing cycles based on internal factors rather than marketing cycles; and\n•evolving functionality demands.\nIf our efforts in pursuing sales and customers are unsuccessful, or if our sales cycles lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe recognize most of our revenue ratably over the term of our agreements with customers and, as a result, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nIn recent years, we have transitioned our business to a subscription model. As we continue this shift, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to successfully manage such shift, which depends upon our ability to, among other things, properly price our subscription-based arrangements, deliver SaaS, retain our customers, and further develop or acquire related technologies and infrastructure.\nWe recognize most of our revenue ratably over the terms of our agreements with customers. As a result, a portion of the revenue that we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new subscription sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that period. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in \n19\n\n\nfuture periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nWe expect to continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative functions, and other areas to grow our business. Such costs are generally expensed as incurred (with the exception of sales commissions and certain research and development costs), as compared to the corresponding revenue, substantially all of which is recognized ratably in future periods. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may develop more slowly, or may be lower, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect our revenue mix and certain business factors to impact the amount of revenue recognized period to period, which could make period-to-period revenue comparisons not meaningful and difficult to predict.\nOur subscription revenue includes revenue from sales of SaaS subscriptions, which is recognized ratably over the contract period, and revenue from sales of term subscriptions, a majority of which is recognized upfront when we transfer control of the license to the customer. Due to the proportion of our contracts trending from term subscriptions and maintenance to SaaS subscriptions, our revenue may fluctuate and period-to-period revenue comparisons may not be meaningful, and our past results may not be indicative of future performance. We cannot be certain how long these factors may persist. These factors make it challenging to forecast our revenue as the mix of solutions and services, as well as the size of contracts, are difficult to predict.\nWe face intense competition in our market, both from larger, well-established companies and from emerging companies, and we may lack sufficient financial and other resources to maintain and improve our competitive position.\nThe market for identity security solutions is intensely competitive and is characterized by constant change and innovation. We face competition from large, well-known enterprise software vendors that offer identity solutions within their product portfolios, pure play identity vendors (including new market entrants), and vendors with whom we have not traditionally competed but who may either introduce new products or incorporate features into existing products that compete with our solutions. For example, our competitors include large public companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle that offer identity solutions within their product portfolios, and identity centric solution providers, including CyberArk, Okta, and One Identity.\nMany of our competitors are larger, have greater resources and existing customer relationships, and may be able to compete and respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. Our competitors may also seek to extend or supplement their existing offerings to provide identity security solutions that more closely compete with our offerings. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase, or incrementally add solutions, from their existing suppliers rather than a new or additional supplier regardless of product performance or features.\nIn addition, merger and acquisition transactions in the technology industry continue to occur, particularly transactions involving cloud-based technologies. Accordingly, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive product than they individually had offered. Companies and alliances resulting from these possible consolidations and partnerships may create more compelling product offerings and be able to offer more attractive pricing, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively. In addition, continued industry consolidation may adversely impact customers’ perceptions of the viability of small and medium-sized technology companies and consequently their willingness to purchase from those companies.\nNew start-up companies that innovate and competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our solutions, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if such technologies or products are widely adopted. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors, or continuing market consolidation. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue, and gross margins, increased net losses, and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe anticipate that our operations will continue to increase in complexity as we grow, which will add additional challenges to the management of our business in the future.\n20\n\n\nOur business has experienced significant growth and is becoming increasingly complex. We increased the number of our employees from 1,394 at December 31, 2020 to 2,738 at January 31, 2025 and the number of countries in which we have employees from 18 at December 31, 2020 to 22 at January 31, 2025. We have also experienced growth in the number of our customers from over 1,700 at December 31, 2020 to approximately 2,975 at January 31, 2025 and the number of countries in which we have customers from over 50 at December 31, 2020 to over 60 at January 31, 2025. We expect this growth to continue and for our operations to become increasingly complex. To effectively manage this growth, we have made, and plan to continue to make, substantial investments to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this complexity effectively without undermining our corporate culture, which we believe has been central to our success. If we are unable to manage this complexity, our business, operations, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.\nAs our customer base continues to grow, we likely will need to expand our professional services and other personnel, and maintain and enhance our existing partner network, to provide a high level of customer service. We also will need to effectively manage our direct and indirect sales processes as the number and type of our sales personnel and partner network continues to grow and become more complex and as we continue to expand into new geographies and vertical markets. This complexity is further driven by the various ways in which we sell our solutions, including on a per identity and per module basis through SaaS and other subscription offerings. If we do not effectively manage the increasing complexity of our business and operations, the quality of our solutions and customer service could suffer, and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. These factors could impair our ability, and our channel partners’ ability, to attract new customers, retain existing customers, expand our customers’ use of existing solutions and adoption of more of our products, and continue to provide high levels of customer service, all of which would adversely affect our reputation, overall business, operations, operating results, and financial condition.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales, results of operations, and remaining performance obligations.\nHistorically, we have experienced seasonality in remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) and customer sales, as we typically sell a higher percentage of our solutions to new customers and renewal subscriptions with existing customers in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We believe that this results from the procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles of many of our customers, particularly our enterprise customers. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our sales, RPO, and results of operations in the future and might become more pronounced as we continue to target larger enterprise customers.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial position and lower our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq\"). The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, could make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and could place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur internal resources and personnel may in the future be insufficient to avoid accounting errors, and there can be no assurance that we will not have material weaknesses in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered implementing required new or improved controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control \n21\n\n\nover financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until our second annual report required to be filed with the SEC. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, or operating.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand or reputation as an industry leader and innovator, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a leader and innovator in the market for identity security solutions is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and our ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality solutions, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform and solutions from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reports of our solutions, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our solutions in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reports. If these reports are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors, our reputation may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our channel partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our solutions as implemented by our channel partners or with the implementation generally. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new geographies and vertical markets, and as more sales are generated through our channel partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nSales to enterprise customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations.\nWe target our sales to enterprise customers and large organizations, which involves risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller customers, including the commercial customer segment. These risks include longer sales cycles and negotiations, more complex customer requirements (including audit and other requirements driven by such customers’ regulatory and industry contexts), substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. For example, enterprise customers may require considerable time to evaluate and test our platform and solutions and those of our competitors prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order or may need specialized security features to meet regulatory requirements. A number of factors influence the length and variability of our sales cycle, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our platform and solutions, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles, the macroeconomic uncertainty and challenges and resulting increased technology spending scrutiny, and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes. Since the processes for deployment, configuration, and management of our platform and solutions are complex, we are also often required to invest significant time and other resources to train and familiarize potential customers with our platform and solutions. Customers may engage in extensive evaluation, testing, and quality assurance work before making a purchase commitment, which increases our upfront investment in sales, marketing, and deployment efforts, with no guarantee that these customers will make a purchase or increase the scope of their subscriptions. In certain circumstances, an enterprise customer’s decision to use our platform and solutions may be an organization-wide decision, and therefore, these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our platform and solutions. As a result, the length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to deal closure, has varied, and may continue to vary, significantly from customer to customer, with sales to large enterprises and organizations typically taking longer to complete. Moreover, large enterprise customers often begin to deploy our platform and solutions on a limited basis but nevertheless demand configuration, integration services, and pricing negotiations, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will deploy our identity security solutions widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial upfront investment.\nGiven these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue from a sale will be recognized due to the variety of ways in which customers may purchase our platform and solutions. This may result in lower than expected revenue in any given period, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n22\n\n\nBecause our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales and marketing of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, and we perform a significant portion of our development outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nAt January 31, 2025, we had customers in over 60 countries and employees in over 20 countries, and we intend to continue expanding our international sales and marketing operations.\nConducting international operations subjects us to risks that we do not generally face in the United States. These risks include:\n•encountering existing and new competitors with stronger brand recognition in the new markets;\n•challenges developing, marketing, selling, and implementing our platform and solutions caused by language, cultural, and ethical differences, and the competitive environment;\n•heightened risks of unethical, unfair, or corrupt business practices, actual or claimed, in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements;\n•global and domestic political instability, economic sanctions, terrorist activities, or international conflicts, including the conflict in Israel and the surrounding area and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which have in the past and may in the future impact the operations of our business or the businesses of our customers;\n•currency fluctuations;\n•the risks of currency hedging activities to limit the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, should we engage in such activities in the future;\n•difficulties in managing systems integrators and technology providers;\n•laws imposing heightened restrictions on data usage and increased penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws, particularly in the EU;\n•risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign import requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our solutions required in foreign countries, as well as changes in trade, tariffs, restrictions, or requirements;\n•potentially different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n•management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion;\n•increased turnover of international personnel as compared to our domestic operations;\n•potentially adverse tax consequences, including multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures, the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, and changes in tax rates;\n•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collection, and longer collection periods;\n•the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n•lack of familiarity with local laws, customs, and practices, and laws and business practices favoring local competitors or commercial parties.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our international business and, consequently, our operating results. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We \n23\n\n\ncannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or net income.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, including those caused by the ongoing conflicts around the world, or reductions in technology spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.\nGlobal business activities face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, and our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. Negative conditions in the general economy in the United States, Europe, or Asia and in the global economy, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, inflation and efforts to control further inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures, international trade relations, political turmoil (such as the conflict in Israel and the surrounding area and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), potential U.S. federal government shutdowns, natural catastrophes, warfare, and terrorist attacks could cause a decrease in business investments by existing or potential customers, including spending on technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. As an example, in the United States, capital markets have experienced and continue to experience volatility and disruption. Furthermore, inflation rates in the United States have recently increased to levels not seen in decades. Global economic and global and domestic political uncertainty may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending generally, or IT and identity security spending specifically, and may ultimately result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our international operations.\nIn addition to the foregoing, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other third parties, such as bank failures or concerns or speculation about any similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which in turn may cause third parties, including our customers, to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements as well as general disruptions or instability in the financial markets. Such economic volatility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and future market disruptions could negatively impact us. In particular, we have in the past experienced longer sales cycles and related negotiations for prospective customers and existing customer expansions, reduced contract sizes, or generally increased scrutiny on technology spending and budgets from existing and potential customers, due in part to the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty. These customer dynamics may again occur in the future, and to the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn, a recession, or another situation where technology budgets grow at a slower rate or contract, these customer dynamics may be exacerbated.\nWe have employees and contractors in locations throughout the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, including in Israel. If the global effect of the ongoing conflict in Israel and the surrounding area or the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates or expands, our ability to conduct business in these regions could be adversely impacted, potentially resulting in delays to product development, sales and marketing, and other key business functions. Additionally, in light of reports of an increase in Russian cyber attacks in connection with the current conflict, we may face a heightened risk of state-sponsored cyber attacks in the near term. Our competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices in an attempt to attract our customers, which may require us to respond in kind and may negatively impact our existing customer relationships and new customer acquisition strategy. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our identity security solutions. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nWe typically bundle customer support with arrangements for our solutions. In deploying and using our platform and solutions, our customers typically require the assistance of our support teams to resolve complex technical and operational issues. We may be unable to modify the nature, scope, and delivery of our customer support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. We may also be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support. Our sales are highly dependent on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our solutions to existing and new customers.\n24\n\n\nIf we fail to meet contractual commitments related to response time, service level commitments, or quality of professional services, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service or face contract termination, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nDepending on the solutions purchased, our customer agreements contain service level agreements, under which we guarantee specified availability of our platform and solutions. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments to our customers or suffer extended periods of unavailability of our SaaS solution or other subscription offerings, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits or customers could elect to terminate and receive refunds for prepaid amounts. In addition, if the quality of our professional services does not meet contractual requirements, we may be required to re-perform the services at our expense or refund amounts paid for the services. Any failure to meet these contractual commitments could adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and financial condition, and any failure to meet service level commitments or extended service outages of our SaaS solution or other subscription offerings could adversely affect our business and reputation as customers may elect not to renew and we could lose future sales.\nOur business depends, in part, on sales to the public sector, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe derived approximately 12% to 13% of our revenue from sales of our solutions to federal, state, local, and foreign governments and public universities in each of the last three fiscal years, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend in part on our successful procurement of government and other public sector contracts. Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the amount of revenue derived from the public sector include:\n•changes in fiscal or contracting policies;\n•decreases in available government funding;\n•changes in government programs or applicable requirements;\n•the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations; and\n•potential delays or changes in the government appropriations or other funding authorization processes.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments, governmental agencies, and others in the public sector to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the sale of our solutions to the public sector is tied to budget cycles, and there are government requirements and authorizations that we may be required to meet. Further, we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to the contracts we enter into with the public sector, and violations could result in penalties and sanctions, including contract termination, refunding or forfeiting payments, fines and suspension, or debarment from future public sector business. Selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense. Public sector entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose additional compliance requirements, require increased attention to pricing practices, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. For example, some of our government entity customers contract with us on the basis of our authorization under FedRAMP, which has in the past and may in the future require us to undertake additional actions and expense to ensure compliance. Public sector entities may also have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our partners for convenience, for lack of funding, or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. If we represent that we meet certain standards, authorizations (such as FedRAMP), or requirements and do not meet them, or if such authorizations are suspended or revoked, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers, investigation by regulators, or termination rights. Even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our service to public sector entities could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in underlying regulatory requirements could be an impediment to our ability to efficiently provide our service to public sector customers and to grow or maintain our customer base. Any of these risks related to contracting with public sector entities could adversely impact our future sales and results of operations or make them more difficult to predict.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our operating results.\n25\n\n\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to, among other things:\n•develop and enhance our solutions;\n•continue to expand our product development, sales, and marketing organizations;\n•hire, train, and retain employees;\n•respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\n•pursue acquisition opportunities.\nWe may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions, and acquisitions, particularly of development stage companies, may adversely affect our operating results and liquidity as well as our ability to meet expectations.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our solutions and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. As we have in the past, we may in the future choose to do so through the acquisition of, or investment in, new or complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. As a function of the industry in which we operate, we may acquire development stage companies that are not yet profitable, and that require continued investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity as well as our ability to meet expectations, particularly if they were formulated prior to such acquisitions. Development stage companies generally involve a higher degree of risk and have not been proven, require additional capital to develop, and typically do not generate enough revenue to offset increased expenses associated therewith.\nThe identification of suitable acquisition or investment candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or investments. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions and/or investments include:\n•an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by stockholders and third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n•we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any company that we acquire;\n•an acquisition or investment may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, and distract our management;\n•an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;\n•we may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products or effectively integrate them into or with our existing solutions;\n•our use of cash to pay for acquisitions or investments would limit other potential uses for our cash;\n•if we incur debt to fund any acquisitions or investments, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business; and\n26\n\n\n•if we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to the fair value allocation of multiple performance obligations in revenue recognition, the expected period of benefit of contract acquisition costs, the assumptions underlying the fair value used for equity-based compensation expense and estimated useful lives, and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill arising from business combinations. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nChanges in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices, may harm our operating results.\nChanges in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could harm our operating results or the manner in which we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Adoption of such new standards and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us.\nWe track certain business and operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe track certain business and operational metrics, including metrics such as ARR, SaaS ARR, and dollar-based net retention rate, which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate.\nIf our solutions fail to help our customers achieve and maintain compliance with certain government regulations and industry standards, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe we generate a portion of our revenues from our solutions because our customers use our solutions as part of their efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with certain government regulations and industry standards, and we expect that will continue for the foreseeable future. Examples of industry standards and government regulations include the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and associated National Institute for Standards and Testing (\"NIST\") Network Security Standards; the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS); Title 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, which governs food and drug industries; the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (NERC-CIP); the GDPR; the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) Minimum Requirements for Risk Management; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Technology Risk Management \n27\n\n\nNotices. These industry standards may change with little or no notice, including changes that could make them more or less onerous for businesses. In addition, governments may also adopt new laws or regulations, or make changes to existing laws or regulations, that could affect whether our customers believe our solution assists them in maintaining compliance with such laws or regulations. If our solutions fail to expedite our customers’ compliance initiatives, our customers may lose confidence in our solutions and could switch to those offered by our competitors. In addition, if government regulations and industry standards related to IT security are changed in a manner that makes them less onerous, our customers may view compliance as less critical to their businesses, and our customers may be less willing to purchase our solutions. In either case, our sales and financial results would suffer.\nOur success depends on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and key employees. If we are unable to hire, retain, train, and motivate our personnel, or to maintain our corporate culture, our business, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.\nOur success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management team and key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, leadership team, engineers, product managers, sales and marketing personnel, and professional services personnel. Our future success will also depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, and retain additional skilled and highly qualified personnel, which will require significant time, expense, and attention.\nThe majority of our employees, including all of our officers and key employees, are employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more members of our senior management team, particularly if closely grouped, could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and thus, our business, operating results, and prospects. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements.\nCompetition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including sales, professional services, and software engineering, is intense. We have from time to time experienced, and may in the future have, difficulty hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Additionally, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our common stock in the public markets following the expiration of applicable lock-up periods, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us.\nWe believe that our corporate culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. The size of our workforce has grown significantly in recent years, and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. If we are not able to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to continue to foster the innovation, integrity, and collaboration we believe we need to support our growth, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur platform and solutions are billed in multiple currencies, and therefore, a portion of our revenue is subject to foreign currency risk. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform and solutions to our customers outside of the United States, which could also adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, an increasing portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States. These operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While we do not currently hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, if our foreign currency risk increases in the future and we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or commodity appliance malfunction, cyber attack, war, terrorist attack, explosion, or pandemic could impact our business. Our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of a significant natural disaster. Additionally, we rely on third-party systems and enterprise applications, technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities. In the event of a catastrophic event, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our identity security solutions, and breaches of data security, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our \n28\n\n\nbusiness functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute successfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Our Intellectual Property Rights\nOur introduction and use of AI, and the integration of AI with our solutions, may not be successful and may present business, compliance, and reputational challenges, which could lead to operational or reputational damage, competitive harm, legal and regulatory risk, and additional costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have incorporated, and expect to continue to incorporate, AI in our solutions, and this incorporation of AI in our business and operations may become more significant over time. The use of generative AI, a relatively new and emerging technology in the early stages of commercial use, exposes us to additional risks, such as potential damage to our reputation, competitive position, and business, legal and regulatory risks, and additional costs. For example, generative AI has been known to produce false or “hallucinatory” inferences or output, and certain generative AI uses ML and predictive analytics, which can create inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading content, unintended biases, and other discriminatory or unexpected results, errors, or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable by us or any of our related service providers. Accordingly, while AI systems may help provide more tailored or personalized user experiences, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI systems assist in producing in our solutions are, or are perceived to be, deficient, inaccurate, biased, unethical, or otherwise flawed, our reputation, competitive position, and business may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new laws and regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in any of the jurisdictions we operate in may affect the use of our AI systems and our use of third-party AI tools and solutions and may expose us to government enforcement or civil suits.\nAs the legal and regulatory framework encompassing AI matures, it may result in increases in our operational and development expenses that impact our ability to earn revenue from or utilize any AI systems. Any of the foregoing and any similar issues, whether actual or perceived, could negatively impact our users’ experience and diminish the perceived quality and value of our offerings. This in turn could damage our brand, reputation, competitive position, and business. Additionally, if any of our employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, or service providers use any third-party AI-powered tools or solutions in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent disclosure or incorporation of our confidential information into publicly available training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property or confidential information, harming our competitive position and business. Our ability to mitigate risks associated with disclosure of our confidential information, including in connection with AI systems, will depend on our implementation, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of appropriate technical and administrative safeguards, policies, and procedures governing the use of AI in our business.\nAdditionally, any output created by us using AI tools may not be subject to copyright protection, which may adversely affect our intellectual property rights in, or ability to commercialize or use, any such content. In the United States, a number of civil lawsuits have been initiated related to the foregoing and other concerns, any one of which may, among other things, require us to limit the ways in which our AI systems are trained and may affect our ability to develop our AI-powered solutions. For example, the output produced by AI tools may include information subject to certain privacy or right of publicity laws or constitute an unauthorized derivative work of the copyrighted material used in training the underlying AI model, any of which could also create a risk of liability for us, or adversely affect our business or operations. AI-related lawsuits to date have generally focused on AI service providers, which may increase our risks of liability. In addition, the use of AI has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity breaches, incidents, or disruptions that implicate the personal information of clients of AI systems. To the extent that we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content used in or produced by the AI tools used in our business, or if we experience cybersecurity incidents in connection with our use of AI, it could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to legal liability or regulatory risk, including with respect to third-party intellectual property, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, publicity, contractual, or other rights. Further, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively.\nAs the utilization of AI becomes more prevalent, we anticipate that it will continue to present new or unanticipated ethical, reputational, technical, operational, legal, competitive, and regulatory issues, among others. We expect that our incorporation of AI in our business will require additional resources, including the incurrence of additional costs, to develop and maintain our solutions and features to minimize potentially harmful or unintended consequences, to comply with applicable and emerging laws and regulations, to maintain or extend our competitive position and to address any ethical, reputational, technical, operational, legal, competitive, or regulatory issues which may arise as a result of any of the foregoing. As a result, the challenges presented with our use of AI could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n29\n\n\nOur ability to introduce new identity security solutions and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources and our ability to successfully complete acquisitions. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts or complete acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to offer new data security solutions and enhancements to our platform and existing solutions. This is particularly true as we further expand and diversify our capabilities. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we elect not to or are unable to develop solutions internally due to certain constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability, or a lack of other research and development resources, we may choose to expand into a certain market or strategy via an acquisition for which we could potentially pay too much or fail to successfully integrate into our operations. We may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. For additional information about the risks we face in connection with acquisitions, see “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management’s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions, and acquisitions, particularly of development stage companies, may adversely affect our operating results and liquidity as well as our ability to meet expectations.” Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their respective research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors’ research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors would give an advantage to such competitors, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, there is no assurance that our research and development or acquisition efforts will successfully anticipate market needs and result in significant new marketable solutions or enhancements to our solutions, design improvements, cost savings, revenues, or other expected benefits. If we are unable to generate an adequate return on such investments, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCyber attacks or other cybersecurity breaches, incidents, or disruptions with respect to our networks, systems, or applications, including unauthorized access to, or disclosure or other processing of, our proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, including personal information, could disrupt our operations, compromise sensitive information related to our business or personal information processed by us or on our behalf, and expose us to liability, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and as we grow, we may become a more attractive target for cyber attacks.\nOur solutions analyze and otherwise process proprietary and confidential information, including personal information. Increasingly, companies in our industry are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks and systems. As a well-known provider of identity security solutions, we pose an attractive target for such attacks, and as our footprint grows larger, we may become an even more attractive target for cyber attacks. We have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, various attempts to access or disrupt our networks, systems, and applications. We face threats from a variety of sources, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, cyber criminals, terrorists, and politically motivated groups or individuals that pose risks to our internal networks, our platform, our third-party service providers, and our customers’ systems and the proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, including personal information processed by us or on our behalf.\nThe nature of the attacks perpetrated against us may include theft of sensitive information, exploitation of our solutions as part of a supply chain attack against our customers, manipulation of data, ransomware, or others. Any of these attacks, if successful, can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. In the case of ransomware, extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. We do expend and may be required to expend significantly more capital and financial resources in the future to protect against any such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security.\nMoreover, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be increasingly difficult to integrate companies into our IT environment and security program successfully, or at all.\n30\n\n\nDespite significant efforts to create security barriers to safeguard against such threats, it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. Despite our security measures, our and our third-party service providers’ IT and infrastructure may be vulnerable to security risks, including unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of customer data, theft of proprietary information, employee error or misconduct, denial of service attacks, loss or corruption of customer data, and computer hacking attacks or other cyber attacks subsequently originated from our infrastructure. The security measures we have integrated into our internal networks and platform, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity, protect our proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, including personal information, prevent data loss and prevent or minimize security breaches, incidents, or disruptions, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to protect our internal networks and platform against certain attacks. In addition, techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and may be difficult to discover for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. For example, threat actors may leverage emerging AI technologies to develop new hacking tools and attack vectors, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure their activities, and increase the difficulty of threat attribution and remediation. Such cyber attacks and other cybersecurity breaches, incidents, or disruptions may continue to evolve in frequency and sophistication, and as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or reasonably implement adequate preventative measures to prevent an electronic intrusion into our networks.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of our or our third-party service providers’ security occurs, whether as result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, our brand and reputation could be impacted, we could lose potential sales and existing customers, our ability to operate our business could be impaired, we could be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements, and restrictions on data processing, and we may incur significant liabilities. Some of our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that any such limitations of liability are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to any such breaches. Additionally, while our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain breaches, subject to retention amounts that could be substantial, we cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to any such breaches, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that such coverage will pay future claims. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or larger deductibles, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to identity security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and/or government enforcement actions. Further, our solutions may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation. Our ability to retain existing customers, expand solutions, and use case penetration with existing customers and acquire new customers is dependent upon our reputation as a trusted intelligent security provider. The importance of our reputation in retaining existing business and acquiring new business is heightened by our focus on enterprise customers. In addition, we have a number of customers that operate in highly-regulated industries where our customers’ data is particularly sensitive, such as financial services and healthcare. A network or security breach could damage our relationships with customers, result in the loss of customers across one or more use case or solution, and make it more challenging to acquire new customers, and such damage would likely be heightened in the event a network or security breach occurred in the highly-regulated industries we serve. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage, systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we and our customers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.\nOur operations involve analyzing and processing our customers’ and other third parties’ confidential and proprietary information, including, in some cases, personally identifiable information. We have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of such information, including customer data. As a result, security incidents impacting our platform or the systems of our third-party service providers could result in a risk of loss or unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information we process on behalf of our customers. This, in turn, could require notification under applicable data privacy regulations and could lead to litigation, governmental audits and investigations, and possible liability, damage our relationships with our existing customers, trigger indemnification and other contractual obligations, cause us to incur investigation, mitigation, and remediation expenses, and have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Furthermore, any such incident, including a breach of our customers’ systems, could compromise our networks or networks secured by our solutions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our or our customers’ networks, and the information stored on our or our customers’ systems could be accessed or disclosed without authorization, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. An actual or perceived breach of our networks, our customers’ networks, those of our third-party service providers or other networks secured by our \n31\n\n\nsolutions, whether or not due to a vulnerability in our platform, may also undermine confidence in our platform or our industry and result in expenditure of significant resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, delayed or lost revenue, delay in the development or release of new solutions, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, damage to our brand and reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, increased insurance expense, and costly litigation.\nIn addition, if a high-profile security incident occurs with respect to another identity security solution provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the value of the identity security solution business model generally, including the security of our solutions, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones, potentially causing a negative impact on our business. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact market acceptance of our solutions and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nInterruptions, outages, or other disruptions affecting the delivery of our SaaS solution, or any of the third-party cloud-based systems that we use in our operations, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing customers and new customers to consistently access our platform and solutions at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. In addition, our ability to access certain third-party SaaS solutions, including those of our service providers, is important to our operations and the delivery of our customer support and professional services. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems both in the delivery of our SaaS solution and in third-party SaaS solutions we use due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, malicious actors, human or software errors, or capacity constraints. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. If our SaaS solution or the third-party SaaS solutions we depend on are unavailable or if our customers are unable to access features of our SaaS solution within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business would be negatively affected.\nWe host our SaaS solution primarily using AWS data centers. Our related operations depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted in AWS by maintaining its configuration, architecture, features, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and which third-party internet service providers transmit. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize multiple AWS locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, or other natural disasters, cyber attacks, terrorist, or other attacks, public health issues, or other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our SaaS platform. A prolonged AWS service disruption affecting our SaaS platform for any of the foregoing or other reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the AWS services we use, which would also likely require significant investments of time. In addition, AWS may terminate the agreement by providing 30 days’ prior written notice and may, in some cases, terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon notice. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of AWS services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our SaaS solution for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party software to provide many essential financial and operational services to support our business. Some of these vendors are less established and have shorter operating histories than traditional software vendors. Moreover, many of these vendors, including Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday, and ServiceNow, provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. As a result, we depend upon these vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes. Interruptions, outages, or other disruptions affecting SaaS solutions that we rely on can significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such disruptions could cause operational delays, inefficiencies, and customer dissatisfaction, which could result in increased customer churn, revenue loss, and increased mitigation costs and potential penalties for not meeting service-level agreements. Frequent or significant disruptions could damage our reputation, making it harder to attract and retain customers. Additionally, service disruptions can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements, which could lead to legal penalties and increased scrutiny.\n32\n\n\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements, or preferences, our platform and solutions may become less competitive.\nThe market in which we compete is relatively new and subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. In addition, as our customers’ technologies and business plans grow more complex, we expect them to face new and increasing challenges. Our customers require that our solution effectively identifies and responds to these challenges without disrupting the performance of our customers’ IT systems. As a result, we must continually modify and improve our solutions and introduce or acquire new solutions in response to changes in our customers’ IT infrastructures.\nWe may be unable to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or be able to develop enhancements to our platform or existing solutions or new solutions to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner, if at all. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce enhancements to our platform and existing solutions and new solutions, those enhancements and new solutions may not achieve widespread market acceptance. Our enhancements or new solutions could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n•delays in releasing platform or solutions enhancements or new solutions;\n•inability to interoperate effectively with existing or newly introduced technologies, systems, or applications of our existing and prospective customers;\n•defects, errors, or failures in our platform or solutions;\n•negative publicity about the performance or effectiveness of our platform or solutions;\n•introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors;\n•installation, configuration, or usage errors by our customers or partners; and\n•changing of regulatory requirements related to security.\nIf we were unable to enhance our platform or existing solutions or develop new solutions that keep pace with rapid technological and industry change, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or disruptions in our platform and solutions could adversely affect our customers’ satisfaction with our solutions and/or our industry reputation and business could be harmed.\nOur platform and solutions are very complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects, vulnerabilities, or errors, especially when solutions are first introduced or enhanced. Our platform and solutions are often used in connection with large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment, and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of products, or other aspects of the computing environment into which our solutions are deployed. If our platform and solutions are not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruption of service may result. In addition, deployment of our platform and solutions into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose errors, failures, or vulnerabilities in our solutions. Any such errors, failures, or vulnerabilities may not be found until after they are deployed to our customers. Some of our software and features are powered by ML and AI, which depend on datasets and algorithms that could be flawed, including through inaccurate, insufficient, outdated, or biased data. From time to time, we have experienced errors, failures, and bugs in our platform that have resulted in customer downtime, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to mitigate future errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in a quick or cost-effective manner.\nWe and certain of our third-party service providers have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website, or third-party hosting disruptions or capacity constraints due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, cyber attacks, security incidents, natural disasters, or fraud. We have also been the target of distributed denial of service attacks and other \n33\n\n\ncybersecurity attacks that attempt to disrupt our services. If our or our third-party service providers’ products, solutions, or corporate security are compromised, our website, professional services, customer support, or SaaS solution is unavailable, or there are flaws in our ML and AI processes, our business could be negatively affected. Moreover, if our security measures or solutions or third-party service providers are subject to cyber attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our website or other solutions, our solutions may be perceived as insecure, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure. In particular, our cloud-based solutions may be especially vulnerable to interruptions, performance problems, or cyber attacks. Furthermore, our solutions may not help detect situations in which a valid user identity has been compromised, for example as part of a highly sophisticated cyber attack of the type described below. If we, our third-party service providers, our partners, or one or more customers were to suffer a highly publicized breach, even if our platform and solutions perform effectively, such a breach could cause our customers or potential customers to lose trust in our identity security solutions in general, which could cause us to suffer reputational harm, lose existing commercial relationships and customers, or deter them from purchasing additional products, and prevent new customers from purchasing our solutions. Highly publicized cybersecurity events have heightened consumer, legislative, and regulatory awareness of these kinds of cybersecurity risks, while further emboldening individuals or groups to target IT systems more aggressively, highlighting the vulnerability of IT supply chains.\nWe continue to invest in the personnel, infrastructure, and third-party best practice software solutions and services necessary to mitigate these risks. However, if we are unable to attract and retain personnel with the necessary cybersecurity expertise, or fail to implement sufficient safeguarding measures, we may not be able to prevent, detect, and mitigate potentially disruptive events which could occur in the future. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these events within an acceptable period of time. Even with these investments, we may not be able to stop a complex and sophisticated cyber attack. Such attacks can be particularly difficult to prevent or fully mitigate when they occur in the supply chain. If we are or become a target of such an attack, we may not be able to prevent, detect, and mitigate such an attack, which could cause disruptions in service or other performance problems, hurt our reputation and our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, and damage our customers’ businesses.\nSince our customers use our platform and solutions for important aspects of their security environment and operational business, any real or perceived errors, failures, or vulnerabilities in our solutions, or disruptions in service or other performance problems, could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. Furthermore, defects, errors, vulnerabilities, or failures in our platform or solutions may require us to implement design changes or software updates. Any defects, vulnerabilities, or errors in our platform or solutions, or the perception of such defects, vulnerabilities, or errors, could result in: (i) expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects; (ii) loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners; (iii) delayed or lost revenue; (iv) delay or failure to attain market acceptance; (v) delay in the development or release of new solutions; (vi) negative publicity, which will harm our reputation; (vii) an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation; and (viii) harm to our operating results.\nThe contractual protections we have in our standard terms and conditions of sale, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, may not fully or effectively protect us from claims by customers, commercial relationships, or other third parties. Any insurance coverage we may have may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us or may cover only a portion of such claims. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and the diverting of management’s time and other resources.\nIf our platform and solutions do not effectively interoperate with our customers’ existing or future IT infrastructure and applications, implementations could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our business.\nOur success depends on the interoperability of our platform and solutions with third-party applications and data that we have not developed and do not control. Any changes in such applications or data that degrade the functionality of our platform or solutions or give preferential treatment to competitive software could adversely affect the adoption and usage of our solutions. We may not be successful in adapting our platform or solutions to operate effectively with these applications or data. If it is difficult for our customers to access and use our platform or solutions, or if our platform or solutions cannot connect a broadening range of applications and data, then our customer growth and retention may be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform and solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n34\n\n\nOur platform and solutions are deployed in a wide variety of IT infrastructures, including large-scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend, at least in part, on our ability to support such deployments. Implementations of our platform and solutions may be technically complicated, and it may not be easy to maximize the value of our platform and solutions without proper implementation, training, and support. Some of our customers have experienced difficulties implementing our platform and solutions in the past and may experience implementation difficulties in the future. If we or our customers are unable to implement our platform and solutions successfully, customer perceptions of our platform and solutions may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, or customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or purchase additional identity security solutions from us.\nAny failure by customers to appropriately implement our platform and solutions or any failure of our platform and solutions to effectively integrate and operate within our customers’ data management infrastructure could result in customer dissatisfaction, impact the perceived reliability of our platform and solutions, result in negative press coverage, negatively affect our reputation, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe use third-party licensed software, third-party licensed services, and cloud services subscriptions in or with our solutions, and the inability to maintain these licenses and subscriptions or issues with the software we license or services we leverage could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur solutions include software or other intellectual property licensed from certain third parties, and we use certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and intellectual property in the future, and from time to time, we may be required to renegotiate our current third-party licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new solutions or enhancements thereto or to facilitate new business models. This exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control. For example, the third-party software we currently license may not always be available, or available on commercially reasonable terms, and we may not have access to alternative third-party software in the event of any issues with such software. In addition, a third party may assert that we or our customers are in breach of the terms of applicable licenses, which could, among other things, force us to cease use of such software and give such third party the right to terminate the applicable license or seek damages from us, or both. Additionally, we may not have the right to control the maintenance, prosecution, preparation, filing, enforcement, defense, or litigation of intellectual property that we license from third parties and are reliant on our licensors to do so. We also cannot be certain that activities such as intellectual property protection, maintenance, prosecution, and enforcement by our licensors have been or will be conducted consistent with our best interests or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable intellectual property rights. It is possible that our licensors’ infringement proceedings or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves or may not be conducted in accordance with our best interests. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may offer our solutions. Our inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights, to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation or any other proceedings regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of new solutions and could otherwise disrupt our business, until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed, or developed, if at all. Also, to the extent that our platform and solutions depend upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors, vulnerabilities, compromises, or defects in such third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our solutions, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our platform, and injure our reputation. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, or adequately enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired, and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nWe regard the protection of our copyrights, proprietary software, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and agreements, protective covenant agreements, and other contractual protections with our employees, independent contractors, advisers, channel partners, resellers, and customers to protect our trade secrets, proprietary information, and intellectual property rights.\nWe strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on foreign, federal, state, and common law rights, as well as certain contractual restrictions. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including physical, operational, and managerial protections of our confidential information, contractual obligations of confidentiality, assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, license agreements, the prosecution, defense, \n35\n\n\nenforcement, protection, and maintenance of registrations and applications for registration of intellectual property rights, and the defense and enforcement of common law rights require significant resources and may be inadequate. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent, and domain name protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and expenses and the costs of defending and enforcing our rights. Given the costs and expenses of obtaining, maintaining, protecting, exploiting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, we may choose not to obtain, maintain, protect, exploit, defend, or enforce certain intellectual property rights that later turn out to be important. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect, exploit, defend, or enforce our intellectual property rights are adequate or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate permissions or protections for all of the intellectual property rights we use or rely on.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks, trade names, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, infringed, diluted, circumvented, misappropriated, or otherwise violated or declared invalid or unenforceable or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. Our domain names and social media handles may also be misappropriated or otherwise misused. Further, at times, competitors may adopt trade names, trademarks, domain names, or social media handles similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build, maintain, or extend brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion or brand dilution. Furthermore, even if we are able to obtain intellectual property rights, any challenge to our intellectual property rights could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. Litigation may become necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others, which may diminish the value of our brand and other intangible assets and allow competitors to more effectively mimic our solutions.\nWhile it is our policy to require our employees, contractors, and other parties with whom we conduct business who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property for us to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Additionally, any such assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Further, although it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets, confidential information, software, or other proprietary technology and, even if entered into, these agreements may otherwise fail to effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary or confidential rights, information, or technologies, may be limited as to their term, or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, use, or other violation of our trade secrets, confidential information, and other proprietary rights or technologies.\nWe pursue the registration or protection of our domain names and trademarks in the United States and in certain jurisdictions abroad. However, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection and enforcement mechanisms may not be available in those jurisdictions, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or marketing of competing products or solutions in violation of our intellectual property rights generally. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, including contractual counterparties, which may be costly to defend, result in damage to our reputation, and could require us to pay significant damages, limit our ability to use certain technologies, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to notices or claims that we have infringed, misappropriated, or misused the intellectual property of our competitors or other third parties, including third parties that may have significantly larger and more mature patent holdings than we do or are patent holding companies whose sole business is to assert such claims. To the extent we increase our visibility in the market, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Additionally, despite our efforts to ensure that our employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and service providers do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how of third parties in their work for us, intellectual property, including copyrighted materials, trade secrets, software code, or other proprietary information, we have been and could in the \n36\n\n\nfuture be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our contractors, consultants, vendors, and service providers have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, copyrighted materials, trade secrets, or other proprietary information of our competitors, former employers, or other parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our solutions, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of these parties. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop, market, and support potential solutions or enhancements, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them or otherwise be liable for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform, solutions, or other contractual obligations. See “—Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation as well as other losses.”\nAny intellectual property, indemnification, or wrongful use or disclosure claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive, could require litigation, and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party’s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any aspect of our business that may ultimately be determined to infringe on or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, we could be forced to limit or stop sales of licenses to our platform and solutions and may be unable to compete effectively. We could also lose valuable intellectual property rights or key personnel as a result of a wrongful disclosure dispute. Furthermore, we may be subject to indemnification obligations with respect to third-party intellectual property pursuant to our agreements with our channel partners or customers. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation as well as other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and certain partners include indemnification provisions under which we agree to defend and indemnify such customer or partner for losses suffered or incurred as a result of third-party claims for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of our solutions. The intellectual property infringement indemnity to such customers or partners is an uncapped liability for which we would be responsible, and intellectual property indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement.\nFrom time to time, customers also require us to indemnify them for a third-party claim for a violation of law arising from our breach of obligations under the applicable agreement. The existence of such a dispute may have adverse effects on our customer relationship and reputation, and even if we contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any assertions by a third party, whether or not successful, with respect to any of these indemnification obligations could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, expensive remediation and licenses, divert management attention and financial resources, harm our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our platform and solutions, and harm our brand, business, operating results, and financial condition. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur use of “open source” software could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nSome aspects of our platform and solutions are built using open source software, and we intend to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source software licenses and anticipate doing so in the future. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable, and modifiable. However, certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, make available source \n37\n\n\ncode for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, incorporate or use the open source software, and/or license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license or otherwise unfavorable terms. The terms of certain open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to monetize our solutions. While we try to insulate our proprietary code from the effects of such open source license provisions, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful, that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our solutions, that our developers have not incorporated open source software into our solutions in potentially disruptive ways, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source software license. These claims could result in costly litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement or violation. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software and, thus, may contain security vulnerabilities or broken code. Moreover, some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability, and are provided on an “as-is” basis. There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Further, our use of any AI tools that use, incorporate, or output any open source software may heighten the foregoing risks. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nWe may incur significant indebtedness, which could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe are currently party to a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”) in an original aggregate principal amount of $1.59 billion and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). While as of March 27, 2025, we have fully repaid the Term Loan and have no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility, we have historically relied on the availability of debt financing and we may incur significant indebtedness in the future under the Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Our ability to meet our future debt service obligations, if any, will depend on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control, including the factors described in this “Risk Factors” section. If we are unable to generate adequate cash flow to meet any such obligations, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, our existing Credit Agreement and any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The amount and terms of any future indebtedness could also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions as well as require us to allocate more of our cash flow from operations to the payment of outstanding indebtedness, rather than research and development or business growth.\nThe terms, conditions, and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement could expose us to risks that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Credit Agreement contains, and any future debt agreements may contain, various covenants that, among other things, limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ abilities to:\n•incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;\n•create additional liens on our assets;\n•merge, consolidate, or dissolve;\n•make loans or investments, including acquisitions;\n38\n\n\n•sell assets;\n•engage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n•pay dividends and make other distributions on our capital stock, and redeem and repurchase our capital stock; or\n•enter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains, and any future debt agreements may also contain, numerous affirmative covenants, including financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our then outstanding debt. \nInterest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIndebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur additional variable interest rate indebtedness in the future. This exposes us to interest rate risk, and any interest rate swaps we enter into in order to reduce interest rate volatility may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe will face risks associated with the growth of our business with certain heavily regulated industry verticals.\nWe market and sell our platform and solutions to customers in heavily regulated industry verticals, including the banking, healthcare, and financial services industries. As a result, we face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from the governmental entities and agencies that regulate those industries. Entering new heavily regulated verticals and expanding in those verticals in which we are already operating will continue to require significant resources to address potential regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful or beneficial to us. If we are unable to successfully penetrate these verticals, maintain our market share in such verticals in which we already operate or cost-effectively comply with governmental and regulatory requirements applicable to our activities with customers in such verticals, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or legal or regulatory requirements, rules, industry standards, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions, or penalties against us.\nOur solutions analyze and otherwise process customer information, including personal information and other information supplied by our customers. Our standard customer agreement prohibits customers from sending to or storing sensitive customer data in our solutions, whether proprietary data, confidential data, sensitive personal data, or otherwise. However, we may enter into agreements with customers with unique terms that allow for certain sensitive customer data to be sent to and stored in our solutions. Further, our customers’ use of data concerning, among others, their employees, contractors, customers, and/or partners is essential to their use of our platform and solutions, and our solutions are not architected in a manner that prevents our customers from submitting or storing sensitive customer data. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better secure their information and comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in their data governance, but these features do not ensure their compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy and identity security concerns.\nA wide variety of domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and contractual requirements apply to the use and processing of proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information, including personal information. These laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual requirements, and other obligations are constantly evolving, and we expect that we will continue to become subject to new proposed laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual requirements, and other obligations in the United States, the EU, the UK, and other jurisdictions.\nFor example, in the United States, there are numerous federal, state, and local privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations governing the use and processing of personal data. At the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Moreover, Congress has \n39\n\n\nconsidered, and continues to consider, many proposals for comprehensive national data privacy and cybersecurity legislation. As another example, at the state level, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, “CCPA”)), which, amongst other things, requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices, implement new operational practices, honor requests from California residents to exercise certain privacy rights (such as the right to access and request deletion of their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information) and provides for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that may increase the likelihood of and risks associated with data breach litigation. Many other states have also enacted, or are in the process of enacting, comprehensive privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations that share similarities with the CCPA, which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. In addition, all 50 states have laws that require the provision of notification for security breaches of personal information to affected individuals, state officers, or others. Possible consequences for non-compliance with these various state laws include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general, and legislatures and consumer protection agencies.\nOutside of the United States, an increasing number of laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards apply to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. For example, we are subject to the GDPR in the EU, and in the UK, we are subject to the UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 as supplemented by the GDPR as implemented into UK law (collectively, “UK GDPR”), both of which impose similar, stringent data protection requirements. The GDPR and UK GDPR are wide-ranging in scope and impose numerous additional requirements on companies that process personal data, including imposing special requirements in respect of the processing of personal data, requiring that consent of individuals to whom the personal data relates is obtained in certain circumstances, requiring additional disclosures to individuals regarding data processing activities, requiring that safeguards are implemented to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, creating mandatory data breach notification requirements in certain circumstances, and requiring that certain measures (including contractual requirements) are put in place when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR and UK GDPR also provide individuals with various rights in respect of their personal data, including rights of access, erasure, portability, rectification, restriction, and objection. Failure to comply with the GDPR and the UK GDPR can result in significant fines and other liability, including fines of up to EUR 20 million (or GBP 17.5 million under the UK GDPR) or four percent of global revenue, whichever is greater. European data protection authorities have shown a willingness to impose significant fines and issue orders preventing the processing of personal data on non-compliant businesses and have already imposed fines for GDPR violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of Euros. While the UK GDPR currently imposes substantially the same obligations as the GDPR, the UK GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the UK government). Moreover, the UK government has publicly announced plans to reform the UK GDPR in ways that, if formalized, are likely to deviate from the GDPR, all of which creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty, along with the potential for increased compliance costs and risks for affected businesses. Legal developments in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK, including rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), have also created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of personal data from the EEA and the UK to the United States and other so-called third countries outside the EEA and the UK that have not been determined by the relevant data protection authorities to provide an adequate level of protection for privacy rights. Case law from the CJEU indicates that reliance on the standard contractual clauses—a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism—alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In July 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) rendering the DPF effective as a GDPR transfer mechanism for personal data transferred from the EEA to the United States by U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. In October 2023, the UK Extension to the DPF came into effect, as approved by the UK government, as a data transfer mechanism from the UK to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us, such as implementing the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses, the efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain. Other jurisdictions outside the EU and the UK are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with noncompliance. We cannot yet fully determine the impact these or future laws, rules, and regulations may have on our business or operations. These laws, rules, and regulations may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, subject to differing interpretations, and may be interpreted to conflict with our practices. While we have implemented controls and procedures designed to comply with the requirements of the privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such controls and procedures may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal information. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese and other applicable data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. See Part I, Item 1, “Business—Government \n40\n\n\nRegulations” for more information. Our failure to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws and regulations, or to protect any personal or other customer data, could result in enforcement actions against us, including regulatory fines or other civil or criminal liability, as well as claims for damages, contractual or otherwise, by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial performance, and prospects.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain contractual obligations and have made privacy commitments, including in privacy policies and customer data processing agreements, regarding our use and processing of personal data. As a company that supports customer privacy and security objectives, even the perception of a failure by us to comply with our privacy commitments, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, inhibit adoption of our solutions by current and future customers, or adversely impact our ability to attract and retain workforce talent. Additionally, a failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy commitments could lead to regulator or civil claims if our commitments are found to be deceptive or otherwise misrepresentative of our actual policies and practices.\nLoss, retention, or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on identity security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual requirements, or other actual or asserted obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject may result in significant liability, adverse publicity, inability to process data, and investigations, proceedings, and other legal actions against us by governmental entities and private claims, demands, and litigation. Any such action or other matter could be expensive to defend, may require the expenditure of substantial legal and other costs and substantial time and resources, may result in fines, penalties, or other liabilities, and likely would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may in the future be party to such actions and disputes. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for non-compliance with privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, contractual requirements, or other obligations are rising. Data subjects may also have a private right of action, as well as consumer associations, to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of applicable privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us or be alleged to apply to us. If we fail or are alleged to fail to follow these standards, even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs and face regulatory investigations and other proceedings or private claims, demands, and litigation. In addition, future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, could impair our customers’ ability to collect, use, or disclose data relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our platform and solutions, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. This includes evolutions in definitions of what constitutes “Personal Information” and “Personal Data” subject to privacy laws, especially relating to classification of intellectual property addresses, machine or device identification numbers, location data and other information. Changes in the law may limit or inhibit our ability to offer certain solutions or features, limit the growth of features and/or development of new solutions, including that supported by AI or ML, or limit our ability to operate or expand our business and develop technology alliance relationships that may involve the sharing of data.\nAround the world, there are numerous lawsuits in process against various technology companies that process personal data. If those lawsuits are successful, it could increase the likelihood that our company may be exposed to liability for our own policies and practices concerning the processing of personal data and could hurt our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations, and policies concerning privacy and identity security that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our platform or solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions. Additionally, concerns about security or privacy may result in the adoption of new legislation that restricts the implementation of technologies like ours or requires us to make modifications to our solutions, which could significantly limit the adoption and deployment of our technologies or result in significant expense to modify our solutions.\nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use, and disclosure of the personally identifiable information provided to us by our website visitors. Our publication of our privacy policies and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state, federal, and international action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our actual policies and practices or if our practices are found to be unfair.\n41\n\n\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to the use of AI could adversely affect our use of such technologies in our solutions and business.\nWe use AI throughout our business. As the regulatory framework for AI and automated decision making evolves, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The regulatory framework for AI and similar technologies and automated decision making is changing rapidly. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in non-U.S. jurisdictions or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our solutions and the way in which we use AI and similar technologies. We may not be able to adequately anticipate or respond to these evolving laws and regulations, and we may need to expend additional resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if applicable legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. In addition, because these technologies are themselves highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal or regulatory risks that may arise relating to our use of such technologies. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and could increase our operating expenses, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor example, in August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “AI Act”), which establishes broad obligations for the development and use of AI-based technologies in the EU based on their potential risks and level of impact, came into force. This framework categorizes AI systems, based on the risks associated with such AI systems’ intended purposes, as creating unacceptable or high risks, with all other AI systems being considered low risk. Furthermore, the AI Act includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI, and foundation models, and provides for fines of up to the greater of €35 million or 7% of worldwide annual turnover for violations. There is a risk that our current or future AI-powered solutions may obligate us to comply with the applicable requirements of the AI Act, which may impose additional costs on us, increase our risk of liability, or adversely affect our business. For example, the AI Act prohibits certain uses of AI systems and places numerous obligations on providers and deployers of permitted AI systems, with heightened requirements based on AI systems that are considered high risk. This regulatory framework is expected to have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the EU and beyond, and, together with developing regulatory guidance and judicial decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI and our ability to provide and to improve our solutions, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment, or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act is similar but even broader in scope in that it prohibits bribery of private (non-government) persons as well. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Our sales model presents some risk under these laws. We leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell our solutions and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies, state-owned or affiliated entities, and non-governmental commercial entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedure to address compliance with these laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, and other consequences. Any investigations, actions, or sanctions could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\n42\n\n\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. We are also subject to Israeli export controls on encryption technology for our platform and identity security solutions. If the applicable U.S. or Israeli requirements regarding export of encryption technology were to change or if we change the encryption means in our solutions, we may need to satisfy additional requirements in the United States or Israel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy any additional requirements under these circumstances in either the United States or Israel.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solutions or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provided in violation of such laws, our solutions may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and monetary penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, we could inadvertently provide our solutions to persons prohibited by U.S. sanctions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties, and harm to our reputation.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our operating results.\nBased on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties. Such authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOLs”) carryforwards and certain other tax credits may be subject to limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset future taxable income or taxes. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and other tax attributes could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. “Ownership changes” that have occurred in the past or that may occur in the future could result in the imposition of an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes we can use to reduce taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused.\nWe function as a HIPAA “business associate” or service provider for certain of our customers and, as such, are subject to strict privacy and data security requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, or applicable requirements under state health information laws, we could be subject to significant liability, which can adversely affect our business as well as our ability to attract and retain new customers.\n43\n\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”), imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including “protected health information” (“PHI”) under HIPAA. HIPAA requires, among other things, that “covered entities” and their business associates maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI. Additionally, business associates are required to assist covered entities with various requirements under HIPAA, including reporting certain breaches, security incidents, or other unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI to individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, and the media, depending on the extent of the disclosure. We may function as a business associate for certain of our customers that are HIPAA covered entities and service providers, and in that context we are regulated as a business associate for the purposes of HIPAA.\nIf we are unable to comply with our obligations under HIPAA as a business associate, we could face substantial civil or criminal liability or other regulatory action. HITECH also gave state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Furthermore, the HIPAA-covered entities and service providers to which we provide solutions require us to enter into HIPAA-compliant business associate agreements with them. These agreements impose stringent data security obligations on us. If we are unable to meet the requirements of any of these business associate agreements, we could face contractual liability, as well as possible civil and criminal liability under HIPAA, all of which can have an adverse impact on our business and generate negative publicity, which, in turn, can have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers.\nIn addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including having passed privacy legislation to cover consumer health data and sensitive data. These laws may differ from other state privacy requirements, including in the way such laws are interpreted and enforced by state regulatory authorities, and may be more stringent than HIPAA. Under these state laws, states may impose fines or penalties for violations and, depending on the state, may allow a private right of action for individuals who believe their information has been inappropriately used or disclosed, including from a security incident or breach. Additionally, many state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission have interpreted existing consumer protection laws to impose standards on the privacy, security, use, transfer, disclosure, disposal, and other treatment of an individual’s information, including health information.\nIncreased and complex scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters may require us to incur additional costs or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nIncreased attention to climate change, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and other ESG issues, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, and contracting), impact our reputation or otherwise affect our business performance. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment or voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative investor sentiment toward us and/or our industry, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. To the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may also not be able to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees. We may take certain actions, including the establishment of ESG-related goals, to improve our ESG profile and/or respond to stakeholder demand; however, such actions may be costly or be subject to numerous conditions that are outside our control, and we cannot guarantee that such actions will have the desired effect.\nMoreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and reporting on many ESG matters. Such disclosures may also be at least partially reliant on third-party information that we have not independently verified or cannot be independently verified. In addition, we expect there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG matters, and increased regulation will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. Such ESG matters may also impact our customers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock \n44\n\n\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Nasdaq, may strain our resources, increase our costs, and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. \nAs a public company, we need to comply with laws, regulations, and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC, and the requirements of Nasdaq. As a newly public company, complying with these statutes, regulations, and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our Board and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses as compared to when we were a private company. For example, as a newly public company, we have had to institute a more comprehensive compliance and reporting function, establish new internal policies, and involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in such activities. \nIn addition, we implemented a new ERP system. The ERP system is intended to combine and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources, sales and marketing, and other functions, enabling it to manage operations and track performance more effectively. Any disruptions or difficulties in using the ERP system could adversely affect our controls and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to forecast our business and collect receivables. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention. \nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. \nOur initial public offering (our \"IPO\") occurred in February 2025. Therefore, there has only been a public market for our common stock for a short period of time. Although our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, be sustained. Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in February 2025 at a price of $23.00 per share, our stock price has fluctuated significantly. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following: \n•announcements of new solutions, products, or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors; \n•changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our solutions; \n•shifts in the mix of revenue attributable to SaaS subscriptions from quarter to quarter; \n•departures of key personnel; \n•price and fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; \n•fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float; \n•sales of large blocks of our common stock; \n•actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results; \n•whether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; \n•changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts; \n•litigation involving us, our industry, or both; \n•regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both; \n•general economic conditions and trends; \n•major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets; and \n45\n\n\n•“flash crashes,” “freeze flashes,” or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed. \nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results, or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. \nIf securities analysts or industry analysts were to downgrade our stock, publish negative research or reports, or fail to publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer and our stock price and trading volume could decline. \nThe trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our stock or publish negative research or reports, cease coverage of our company, or fail to regularly publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer and our stock price and trading volume could decline. \nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders. \nWe may issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline. \nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock. \nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. \nProvisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders. \nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things: \n•these provisions allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of stockholders; \n•these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms; \n•these provisions provide that, at any time when Thoma Bravo controls, in the aggregate, less than 40% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, directors may only be removed for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; \n46\n\n\n•these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which Thoma Bravo controls, in the aggregate, less than 35% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; \n•these provisions provide that for as long as Thoma Bravo controls, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any amendment, alteration, or repeal of our bylaws by our stockholders will require the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of our capital stock and at any time when Thoma Bravo controls, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any amendment, alteration, or repeal of our bylaws by our stockholders will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and \n•these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; provided, however, at any time when Thoma Bravo controls, in the aggregate, at least 10% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, such advance notice procedure will not apply to Thoma Bravo. \nWe have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. However, our certificate of incorporation contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person (excluding Thoma Bravo and any of their direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party) who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. These provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. \nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board, including actions to delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction. \nThoma Bravo controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. \nInvestment entities affiliated with Thoma Bravo UGP, LLC (together with its affiliated entities, \"Thoma Bravo\") control approximately 86% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, which means that, based on its percentage voting power, Thoma Bravo controls the vote of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This control enables Thoma Bravo to control the election of the members of the Board and all other corporate decisions. Even when Thoma Bravo ceases to control a majority of the total voting power, for so long as Thoma Bravo continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock, Thoma Bravo will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our Board and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, for such period of time, Thoma Bravo will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans, and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, decisions on whether to raise future capital, and amending our charter and bylaws, which govern the rights attached to our common stock. In particular, for so long as Thoma Bravo continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock, Thoma Bravo will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us or a change in the composition of our Board and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of us and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. \nIn addition, we have entered into a director designation agreement (the “Director Designation Agreement”) with Thoma Bravo that provides it the right to designate: (i) all of the nominees for election to our Board for so long as Thoma Bravo beneficially owns 40% or more of the total number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Thoma Bravo upon completion of the IPO, as adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar changes in our capitalization (such number of shares as may be adjusted, the “Original Amount\"); (ii) a number of nominees for election to our Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to 40% of the total directors for so long as Thoma Bravo beneficially owns at least 30% and less than 40% of the Original Amount; (iii) a number of nominees for election to our Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to 30% of the total directors for so long as Thoma Bravo \n47\n\n\nbeneficially owns at least 20% and less than 30% of the Original Amount; (iv) a number of nominees for election to our Board (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to 20% of the total directors for so long as Thoma Bravo beneficially owns at least 10% and less than 20% of the Original Amount; and (v) one nominee for election to our Board for so long as Thoma Bravo beneficially owns at least 5% of the Original Amount. The Director Designation Agreement also provides that Thoma Bravo may assign such right to an affiliate. The Director Designation Agreement prohibits us from increasing or decreasing the size of our Board without the prior written consent of Thoma Bravo. See Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence—Related Party Transactions—Director Designation Agreement” for more details with respect to the Director Designation Agreement. \nThoma Bravo and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in our industry generally. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Thoma Bravo and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders, such as investing in or advising businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Our certificate of incorporation provides that none of Thoma Bravo, any of its affiliates, or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or its affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Thoma Bravo also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Thoma Bravo may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you or may not prove beneficial. \nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock. \nOur charter authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. \nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents. \nPursuant to our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any claims in state court for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the forum selection provision that identifies the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation, including any “derivative action,” will not apply to suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our certificate of incorporation will also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. The forum selection provisions in our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers and may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. If the enforceability of our forum selection provisions were to be challenged, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such challenge. While we currently have no basis to expect any such challenge would be successful, if a court were to find our forum selection provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of these specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with having to litigate in other jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our employees, management, and Board. \n48\n\n\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. \nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. A significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to a 180-day lock-up period pursuant to lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our IPO and, are therefore, restricted from immediate resale under the federal securities laws. All of these shares of common stock will, however, be able to be resold after the expiration of the lock-up period, as well as pursuant to customary exceptions thereto or upon the waiver of the lock-up agreement by the representatives on behalf of the underwriters. We have also registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, which can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements. As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares of common stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. \nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, qualify for and are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. \nThoma Bravo beneficially owns, on a combined basis, a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, we are a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: \n•a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors as defined under the rules of Nasdaq; \n•the nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and \n•the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities. \nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a controlled company. We currently utilize some or all of these exemptions. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.",
